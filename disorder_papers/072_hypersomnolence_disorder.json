      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequently the consequence of physiological and psychological problems and may be classified in three groups: diminished total quantity of sleep, loss of the quality and inadequate timing of the sleep process. It is considered that one third of the population has a sleep disturbance some time in the life. Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disturbance but timely and careful diagnostic procedure is fundamental for the specific treatment. Factors connected with the increased prevalence of sleep disturbance are female gender, presence of mental or somatic diseases and advanced age. Sleep disturbances are classified in four basic groups: insufficient quantity or unrestorative sleep (insomnia); prolonged sleep (excessive daily somnolence or hypersomnia); problems with timing of sleep and problems close to or within the sleep process (parasomnias).",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder and endogenous neurophysiological dynamics",
      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Sleep deprivation has a significant impact on the optimal functioning of the immune system. Fibromyalgia is a rheumatoid syndrome of unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain and generalized muscular tenderness. An intimate link between pain, mood, and sleep is apparent. Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a condition of unknown etiology characterized by fatigue that persists for more than 6 months and presents with several of the following symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, pharyngitis, tender lymph nodes, non-restorative sleep, and malaise after physical exertion that extends beyond 24 hour.",

When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1.

The main symptom of insomnia is insufficient sleep to carry out the full range of daily functions. The patient who sleeps for only 5 hours a night, but is not sleepy during the day, is a 'short sleeper' and not an insomniac. Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

      "abstract": "Most adults have difficulty sleeping at some time in their lives, with problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or having nonrestorative sleep. When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Excessive Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "title": "Physiological and psychological factors in sleep-onset insomnia.",
      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is the most frequent respiratory sleep disorder. It involves repeated episodes of total (apnoea) or partial (hypopnea) obstruction at night. RLS or Willis-Ekbom disease is a relatively common pathology, with a prevalence of around 2.7%. It is underdiagnosed, which has a negative impact on both the quality of sleep and the patient's life. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization of the sleep/wake rhythm with the light/darkness cycle, generating an unbalanced sleep cycle. REM sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by abnormal repetitive behaviours, such as sleep-related vocalization and complex motor behaviours (intense and violent) during REM sleep, which can cause injuries or sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years.

      "abstract": "Primary insomnia is relatively common. According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, primary insomnia is a syndrome mainly composed of psychophysiological insomnia, paradoxical insomnia and idiopathic insomnia. Primary insomnia is difficulty initiating sleep (sleep onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep (mid-sleep awakening, early morning awakening) or chronic non restorative sleep, which persist longer than three weeks despite having adequate opportunity for sleep and result in impaired daytime functioning. Primary insomnia is not explained by currently known psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, substance use disorders. Primary insomnia is a non-organic, unknown etiology, middle-aged female predominant sleep disturbance. Recent findings suggest the hyperarousal hypothesis of primary insomnia. In the near future, non restorative sleep might be excluded from the definition of primary insomnia.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

      "abstract": "As shown in this review, insomnia is very common and often constitutes a chronic health problem excused by diverse medical, psychiatric and psychosocial conditions as well as substance abuse. Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics. Chronic insomnia is the domain of nonpharmacological psychotherapy, which can be conducted in a single or group setting.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors.

Patients with sleep disorders often benefit from a general medical evaluation to investigate contributing factors. Fatigue and sleepiness may be associated with endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism. The major symptom of Insomnia Disorder is dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep. Insomnia is associated with a wide variety of medical disorders, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorder.

During night polysomnography, there were REM sleep without atonia and abnormally increased REM sleep as 37â87% of total sleep. The RBD improved with clonazepam and there was no recurrence at 1 year follow-up. The global encephalitis could be responsible for the RBD and destruction of sleep architecture.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

Turgid painful erections (five to seven episodes of tumescence) during the sleep hours caused pain together with burning and tingling sensations in the penis and perineal zone during the daytime hours. Swelling of the pubic and perineal area was recurrent. Sleep loss, chronic fatigue, mild anxiety, lack of concentration and decreased work occurred along with this condition. Polysomnographic findings indicated REM sleep fragmentation. Attempts to treat this condition with muscle relaxants or anxiolytics did not prompt an improvement of this disorder, but a single daily dose of gabapentin 300 mg in combination with 1 mg clonazepam at bedtime improved total sleep time and reduced full sleep erections.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIt is still debated whether the deterioration of the sleep pattern, frequently reported by elderly subjects, is due only to aging per se. Other factors associated with aging or modifications of biological rhythms could also be involved. Elderly subjects frequently complain of daytime sleepiness, but it is not clear whether this actually represents a return to a polyphasic structure of sleep, or only a consequence of a disturbed night sleep. Ten healthy, independent and active elderly subjects (age > 72 years) were evaluated by means of 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography. Findings of nocturnal sleep were compared with sleep of the same group in the. 24-hour period and with sleep of young healthy controls. We observed a fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, but a fairly good representation of stages and a preservation of cyclicity. Except for three cases, with early or late times of sleep onset and wake-up, sleep disruption did not seem to be related to modification of circadian rhythms. Only three subjects presented undesired daytime naps, whereas the others either did not show daytime sleep at all, or were used to having their siesta after lunch since their young adulthood. In normal aging, daytime sleep does not constitute a social problem. Ambulatory polysomnography is a valid alternative to laboratory recordings in the identification of daytime sleep.Key Words: Sleepambulatory polysomnographynormal aging",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders.

Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy.

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances.

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints of varied types are extremely common in our society. Although one most commonly associates a sleep disturbance with a complaint of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal events occurring during sleep at night are also frequent complaints. Approximately 10% of the population has a complaint of insomnia that occurs every night for 2 weeks or more,1 whereas up to 30% of people have some sleep disturbance a few nights every month. Up to 10% of the population has significant daytime tiredness and sleepiness and nearly everyone has had some type of abnormal intrusion into sleep such as nightmares, sleepwalking, or some other psychological or physiological intrusion into sleep. However, despite the prevalence in society of sleep disorders, the majority of patients do not present for treatment. About 28% have insomnia associated with a mental disorder.2 Yet, only 5-6% of people will seek a physician in order to address their sleep problem.3 Over 70% of those with insomnia have never discussed the sleep problem with a physician and the majority resort to over-the-counter medications or self-remedies in order to alleviate the sleep disturbance.",

Sleep abnormalities in depression are mainly characterized by increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced slow wave sleep. Among the mechanisms of sleep disturbances in depression are hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, CLOCK gene polymorphism and primary sleep disorders. The habenula is a structure regulating the activities of monoaminergic neurons in the brain. The hyperactivation of the habenula has also been implicated, together with sleep disturbances, in depression. The presence of depression in primary sleep disorders is common. Sleep disturbances treatment include pharmacotherapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.",

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

      "title": "Human consciousness and sleep/waking rhythms: A review and some neuropsychological considerations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The relevance of sleep/waking rhythms to issues of human consciousness is reviewed from data in the literature and from personal studies. Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness\" persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/ waking) and ultradian (90–120 min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

The classic narcolepsy tetrad comprised excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion, most frequently laughter), sleep paralysis and hypnagogic (on falling asleep) and hypnopompic (on waking) hallucinations. Disturbed nighttime sleep was often added to make up a pentad. These symptoms apart from excessive daytime sleep and cataplexy are not uncommon in unaffected individuals and other sleep disorders.

During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

Non-24 disorder occurs when a person's 24-hour circadian rhythm isn't regulated in the brain because it can't receive the daylight that normally acts as a stimulus. Those afflicted will have a circadian rhythm longer than 24 hours, leading to a periodic extended inability to sleep at night. The most common adverse effects of tasimelteon are headache, elevated liver enzyme levels, nightmares or unusual dreams, disturbed sleep, upper respiratory or urinary tract infection, and drowsiness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The two main phases of sleep are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. REM sleep is often called dreaming (or D) sleep, because dreams are reported by about 70–80% of persons awakened during this period. REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

It has been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Chronic medication use, neurological or psychiatric disorders, and environmental factors can also contribute.

      "abstract": "This study describes the clinical features, natural history and treatment of 100 patients with narcolepsy. Over half had one or more affected relatives. Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "abstract": "The authors review the literature on the epidemiology, the clinical and electrophysiological symptoms of somnambulism. The disorder specified as \"nREM parasomnia with awakening disorder\" belongs to the nREM sleep (awakening) parasomnias. In most of the cases its occurence is familial with the highest prevalence at age 12 year. Above age 12 year most cases recover whereas 6% of prevalence is reported in adults. It is probable that most patients seek medical help only in severe cases associated with injuries, accidents or violence. Its etiology is unknown; in essence it is a sleep regulation disorder characterised by a dissociated state of partial awakening from nREM sleep: the motor system becomes awake while consciousness remains clouded. There are several medicines inducing somnambulism in patients otherwise free from this disorder. In somnambule patients the most important provoking factors are sleep deprivation as well as pathological states and circumstances evoking sleep loss. Somnambulism should be differentiated from complex partial epileptic seizures and REM behaviour disorder. As there is no specific treatment at the moment it is important to assure safe sleeping circumstances - ground flour, closed windows, and no fragile furniture. Clonazepam and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prove sometimes effective, but the most effective methods in decreasing the frequency of somnambule episodes are the regular sleep-wakefulness schedule and the avoidance of sleep deprivation.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders.

      "abstract": "Of all the forms of chronic insomnia, perhaps the most insidious is Psychophysiologic insomnia, also called Primary Insomnia in the DSM-IV. This sleep disorder is a final common pathway for many people who initially develop sleeplessness in the context of acute stressors (e.g., pain, job loss), but then acquire a form of \"learned\" sleeplessness as they become increasingly overconcerned about their unsatisfying sleep patterns. Patients report reduced total sleep time, with increased sleep latency (greater than 30 min), or increased wakeafter sleep onset time, though these findings are not always corroborated on PSG studies. Patients with this form of chronic insomnia are often vexed by its seemingly unpredictable nature from night to night, but to be diagnosed symptoms must be present on three or more nights per week, for more than 1 month (DSM-IV) or 6 months (ICSD-2). The essential feature of this form of insomnia is a pattern of sleep disturbance that evolves over time as a result of psychological distress that triggers unhelpful behaviors and physiological arousal. This chapter will summarize the current understanding of the development of this disorder, and the clinical approaches that may be useful to resolve it.",

Importantly, the excessive daytime sleepiness is not due to psychiatric conditions, but rather is always due to sleep deprivation or an underlying diagnosable and treatable sleep disorder.

      "abstract": "In presenting a case of extreme hyposomnia, psychosomatic insomnia is elaborated as a special type of primary insomnia. The case study of a 60 years old man is based on psychiatric examinations, an intersive one-week observation including polygraphic sleep recordings, and on reviewing medical data over a period of 35 years. In this case, the insomnia developed during a life situation with social stress and continued over 30 years with a gradual sleep reduction to 2-4 hours. Our sleep recordings confirmed a total sleep time of nearly 3 hours, a marked rhythmicity of sleep and day-time activities, fragmentation of sleep, and psychogenic extrasystoles, all symptoms having been reported by the subject previously. Autonomic functions indicated a good efficiency of NREM sleep, whereas a first night effect with subsequent adaptation revealed a good regulatory function of the sleep-waking-system. In addition to a detailed documentation of this extraordinary case, an interpretation is undertaken in order to explain, how the insomnia developed and continued. Psychodynamic aspects show a set of characteristics which are most typical for psychosomatic syndroms. The authors expect, that the knowledge about psychosomatic insomnia will be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of severe insomnias.",

      "abstract": "Significance Millions of individuals obtain insufficient sleep on a daily basis, which leads to impaired performance. Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

Sleep, however, is a fragile state that can easily be impaired by psychological stress or physical illness. For up to 10% of the general population, difficulty falling and/or maintaining sleep occurs several times a week (i.e., chronic insomnia). Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common. Narcolepsy is a primary EDS disorder affecting about 0.05% of the population. EDS is also often secondary to a severe insomnia associated with obstructive sleep apnea.",

This article examines the psychiatric disorders that are most often associated to sleep dysfunction as it is related in clinical practice and describes the polysomnographic findings. Patient's main complaints are related to difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (initial or middle insomnia, respectively) and poor quality of sleep. Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep. The reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency is mainly described for the depression, but has also been reported in other psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep problem affecting nearly one-third of the population as either a primary or comorbid condition. Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

      "title": "Disorders of Excessive Sleepiness: Narcolepsy and Hypersomnia",
      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes.

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep.

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society.

Full blown REM sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed clinically, but REM sleep motor dysfunction, a pathophysiological basis of REM sleep behaviour disorder, is difficult to detect without all night polysomnography. Twenty one consecutive patients with multiple system atrophy with no complaints of nocturnal abnormal behaviours were clinically evaluated to determine the presence of sleep related symptoms. All night polysomnography with video monitoring was performed to investigate REM sleep characteristics and patients' behaviours. In 85.7% (18 of 21) of the patients' sleep talk started or increased around or after the clinical onset of the primary diseases. REM sleep without atonia occupied more than 15%(16.2%-100%) of the REM sleep time in all but one patient. In 90.5% (19 of 21) of patients, motor events such as sleep talk and various combinations of craniofacial, orofacial, or limb movements occurred at various frequencies mostly during REM sleep without atonia. In patients with multiple system atrophy, REM sleep motor dysfunction is a common polysomnographic finding which is otherwise overlooked, and sleep talk may be its early clinical manifestation.",

      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are common across the lifespan. This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.",

Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

      "title": "Light Treatment for Sleep Disorders: Consensus Report",
      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months).

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder.

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "abstract": "of the forthcoming 10th revision of the International Classification ofDiseases contains a list of reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders.3 Two examples provide sufficient illustration.Acute stress reaction comprises exposure to an exceptional medical or physical stress followed by the onset, within one hour, of generalised anxiety or any two of the following: social withdrawal, narrowing of attention, apparent disorientation, anger or verbal aggression, despair or hopelessness, inapprop- riate or purposeless overactivity, and uncontrollable and excessive grief.Treatment is supportive and non-specific and the prognosis is favourable.Post-traumatic stress disorder includes brief or prolonged exposure to an exceptional mental or physical stress followed within six months by persistent remembering or reliving of the stress; by intrusive flashbacks, vivid memories, recurring dreams; or by distress when exposed to (or avoiding) circumstances associated with the stressor.These features are accompanied by either psychogenic amnesia or persistent increased psychological sensitivity and arousal with at least two of the following: difficulty in falling or staying asleep, irritability, difficulty concentrating, distractibility or increased restlessness and apprehension.Again, treatment is supportive and non-specific, though the long term outlook is uncertain.Thus at a popular level stress is a vigorous concept that has engendered a prosperous industry dedicated to its relief, while in scientific and medical contexts the concept languishes with dubious reliability and validity.Fifty years ago the stress hypothesis began displacing obscure focuses of infection as an antecedent of a variety of life's ills.As Susser has remarked: \"Many excellent sets of teeth and many pairs of tonsils were sacrificed to that hypothesis.We can count ourselves fortunate that the stress hypothesis does not require surgical intervention.\"'14",

      "title": "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants",
      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

      "abstract": "A patient with a sleep-wake cycle > 24 h recorded his sleep-onset and wake times for 4 years. During this time the patient found himself unable to maintain a 24-h sleep-wake schedule. The lengths of his sleep-wake periods (subjective days) and his sleep periods were highly variable. Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ? Telles sont les nombreuses questions que cette rencontre avec l’expert permettra d’évoquer.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

Insomnia disorder may also increase risk for heart disease. There are many things that trigger insomnia like stress, anxiety, alcohol, tobacco, looking at bright screens, working shifts and too much of caffeine. Once these tricks go away, the insomnia may continue and head to insomnia disorder. This may happen because of habits formed because of insomnia (such as napping, getting in bed before being sleepy, and lying-in bed awake for long periods of time).

      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "title": "Depression, sleep, and antidepressants.",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

      "title": "854 Sexsomnia in a Divorce Proceeding and its Custody Implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "title": "[Dangerous snoring. Sleep-apnea syndrome].",
      "abstract": "Snoring usually is trivial and unimportant, but it can turn into a social or medical problem. Obesity, hypertension and heart disease are more frequent among snorers than among nonsnorers, and especially snorers with hypersomnia during the day are at risk. Hypersomnia in association with snoring usually signifies obstructive sleep apnea. Increased resistance in the upper airways, together with negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure and muscular hypotonia during deep non-REM and REM sleep, lead to collapse of the pharynx, hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only after arousal from sleep does muscle tone return, pharyngeal obstruction reopen and airflow resume. Since this process can occur 300 or 400 times a night, repetitive alveolar hypoventilation leads to pulmonary-arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale, and the repetitive sympathetic activations can cause systemic hypertension or serious cardiac arrhythmias. The countless arousals deprive the sufferer of deep non-REM and REM sleep and their consequence is sleep fragmentation. The symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and personality and behavioral changes. Oronasomaxillofacial, endocrine and neuromuscular anomalies and diseases predispose to sleep apnea, and alcohol or CNS-depressant drugs can favour its occurrence. Diagnosis is made by nighttime oxymetry, and if this is abnormal, by polysomnography. After polysomnography it is possible to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive sleep apnea, and the decisions for an adequate treatment can be made.",

      "abstract": "We report the case of a 43-year-old woman presenting with nocturnal episodes of pain and screaming during sleep starting at age 30. There was no childhood or family history of parasomnia. The events had gradually become more frequent over the years, occurring in the first half of the night within 2 h of sleep onset. There were no triggers, and she had partial amnesia for the events. A diagnosis of adult-onset sleep terrors was made on clinical grounds and supported polysomnographically. Seizures and periodic limb movements were excluded as triggering factors. There was some mild sleep disordered breathing (predominantly non-desaturating hypopnea with a propensity for REM sleep of debatable significance). Imaging of the brain and spine and neurophysiological investigations ruled out lesions, entrapments, or neuropathies as possible causes of pain. Treatment (clonazepam, paroxetine, or gabapentin) was poorly tolerated and made no difference to the nocturnal episodes, while trazodone worsened them. This is the first report of hypnopompic psychic pain in association with a NREM parasomnia. We hypothesize that the pain may represent a sensory hallucination analogous to the more commonly recognized visual NREM parasomnia-associated hypnopompic visual hallucinations and that, as such, it may arise during arousal of the sensory neocortex as confabulatory response.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years of age. The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiologic effect of a substance or a general medical condition. Diurnal enuresis defines wetting, whereas awake and nocturnal enuresis refers to voiding during sleep. Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never been consistently dry through the night, whereas secondary enuresis refers the resumption of wetting after at least 6 months of dryness. Monosymptomatic enuresis has no associated daytime symptoms, and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, which is more common, often has at least one subtle daytime symptom. Monosymptomatic enuresis is rarely associated with significant organic underlying abnormalities. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patients have little or no control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE).In this case-control study, we evaluated 186 children aged 6-17 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group included 93 healthy children, and the case group included 93 age- and sex-matched children with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Then, the children's behavioral status was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.The difference in compulsion was significant (P = 0.021), whereas the difference in obsession was significant between the two groups (P = 0.013). The most common symptom in CKD children with compulsion was silent repetition of words.Compulsive and obsessive are more common in NMNE versus healthy children. The observed correlation between compulsive-obsessive and NMNE makes psychological counseling mandatory in children with NMNE.",

      "title": "A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NIGHTMARES AND NIGHT TERRORS",
      "abstract": "Anxious arousals originate from all sleep stages and can be classified as: a) stage 4 night terrors; b) rapid eye movement (REM) nightmares; c) stage 2 awakenings; and d) hypnagogic nightmares. We have confirmed Broughton's finding that the night terror, the most severe type of episode, does not occur in sleep but as part of the \"arousal response,\" a complex of autonomic discharge and behavioral symptoms. The full blown night terror is a fight-flight episode combining sleep utterances, sleep walking and hallucinated or delusional mental content associated with terror. There is a significant positive correlation between intensity of night terror and the amount of delta sleep preceding arousal, e.g., stage 4 arousals designated as night terrors are preceded by longer periods of stage 4 than arousals of lesser intensity (p <.05). About two-thirds of both stage 4 and night terrors occurs in the first non-REM (NREM) period. The night terror arises out of physiologically quiescent sleep as indicated by the normal or slightly less them normal cardiorespiratory rates during the first NREM period and absence of skin resistance changes prior to the attack. The night terror is ushered in by sudden loud piercing screams, the subject passing into an aroused state characterized by alpha rhythm, motility, often somnambulism, intense autonomic discharge (precipitous doubling or even tripling of heart rate, great increase in respiratory amplitude, marked decrease in skin resistance), brief duration (1 to 3 minutes), varying degrees of amnesia for the episode, and rapid return to sleep. The night terror is a much more severe phenomenon than the REM nightmare although the latter is far more frequent. The nightmare occurs in REM sleep, is characterized by slight autonomic fluctuations, compared to the night terror, and, in half of instances, a \"desomatization\" of the anxiety response, that is, absence of its physiological concomitants. The REM state is physiologically activated to begin with, constituting a preparation for fright, possibly a buffer against the extreme terror of the stage 4 variety. The important problem of the triggering mechanisms of the night terror remains unsolved: whether the attack is precipitated by ongoing mental content during delta sleep, or represents a psychosomatic \"arousal response\" (Broughton). The fact that it can be induced artificially by sounding a buzzer speaks in favor of the latter, the finding of significant mental content in favor of the former. The night terror is not a dream but a symptom emerging from stage 3-4 sleep, associated with a rift in the ego's capacity to control anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%).

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) that is typically associated with cataplexy, sleep fragmentation and other REM sleep-related phenomenon such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination. Narcoleptic symptoms can be developed from various medical or neurological disorders. A 17-year-old male patient admitted for the evaluation of EDS which started three-month ago. He slept more than 18 hours a day with cataplexy and hypnagogic hallucination. He was obese with body mass index (BMI) of 30.4 kg/. After admission he was newly diagnosed to the thyrotoxicosis. T3 391.2 ng/dL (60-181), free T4 4.38 ng/dL (0.89-1.76), TSH /mL (0.35-5.5) were measured. His pulse rate ranged 70-90 beats per minute and blood pressure ranged 150/100-120/70 mmHg. Polysomnography revealed many fragmentations in sleep with many positional changes (81 times/h). Sleep onset latency was 33.5 min, sleep efficiency was 47.9%, and REM latency from sleep onset was delayed to 153.6 min. REM sleep percent was increased to 27.1%. Periodic limb movement index was 13.4/h. In the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), average sleep latency was 0.4 min and there were noted 3 SOREMPs (Sleep Onset REM sleep period) on 5 trials. We couldn't discriminate the obvious sleep-wake pattern in the actigraph and his HLA DQB1 type was negative. His thyroid function improved following treatment with methimazole and propranolol. Vital sign maintained within normal range. Cataplexy was controlled with venlafaxine 75 mg. Subjective night sleep continuity and PLMS were improved with clonazepam 0.5 mg, but the EDS were partially improved with modafinil 200-400 mg. Thyrotoxicosis might give confounding role when we were evaluating the EDS, though sleep fragmentation was one of the major symptoms of narcolepsy, but enormous amount of it made us think of the influence of thyroid hormone. The loss of sleep-wake cycle, limited improvement of EDS to the stimulant treatmen, and the cataplexy not supported by HLA DQB1 should be answered further. We still should rule out idiopathic hypersomnia and measuring CSF hypocretin level would be helpful.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders I",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and split-night studies: consensus statement of the Connecticut Thoracic Society and the Connecticut Neurological Society.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia, <scp>REM</scp> sleep instability and emotional dysregulation: A pathway to anxiety and depression?",
      "abstract": "Summary The world‐wide prevalence of insomnia disorder reaches up to 10% of the adult population. Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious‐like wake experience, reflecting pre‐sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.",

It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "abstract": "We review the literature on REM parasomnias, and their the underlying mechanisms. Several REM parasomnias are consistent with sleep dissociations, where certain elements of the REM sleep pattern emerge in an inadequate time (sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy) or are absent/partial in their normal REM sleep time (REM sleep without atonia, underlying REM sleep behavior disorder). The rest of REM parasomnias (sleep related painful erection, catathrenia) may have other still unclear mechanisms. REM parasomnias deserve attention, because in addition to disturbing sleep and causing injuries, they may shed light on REM sleep functions as well as the heterogeneous etiologies of parasomnias. One of them, REM sleep behavior disorder has special importance as a warning sign of evolving neurodegenerative conditions mainly synucleinopathies (some cases synucleinopathies themselves) and it is a model parasomnia revealing that parasomnias may have by autoimmune, iatrogenic and even psychosomatic etiologies.",

      "abstract": "A syndrome sometimes associated with sleeping late is identified in a student population. It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great. These data suggest the testable hypothesis that optimal durations of sleep fall into a relatively narrow band and that disruptive psycho-physiological effects are sustained with both too much and too little sleep.",

      "title": "OP.02 Restless legs, periodic limb movements and breathing problems",
      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome Without Overdose: Polypharmacy-Induced Toxicity in a Medically Stable Young Adult",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in childhood: a review.",
      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

      "abstract": "The associations between depressive symptoms and hypersomnia are complex and often bidirectional. Of the many disorders associated with excessive sleepiness in the general population, the most frequent are mental health disorders, particularly depression. However, most mood disorder studies addressing hypersomnia have assessed daytime sleepiness using a single response, neglecting critical and clinically relevant information about symptom severity, duration and nighttime sleep quality. Only a few studies have used objective tools such as polysomnography to directly measure both daytime and nighttime sleep propensity in depression with normal mean sleep latency and sleep duration. Hypersomnia in mood disorders, rather than a medical condition per se, is more a subjective sleep complaint than an objective finding. Mood symptoms have also been frequently reported in hypersomnia disorders of central origin, especially in narcolepsy. Hypocretin deficiency could be a contributing factor in this condition. Further interventional studies are needed to explore whether management of sleep complaints improves mood symptoms in hypersomnia disorders and, conversely, whether management of mood complaints improves sleep symptoms in mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

While short naps provide minimal relief, hypersomnia's impact on overall well-being necessitates timely diagnosis and intervention. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive assessment of medical history and, if required, polysomnography. Treatment strategies, ranging from lifestyle modifications to pharmacological interventions, aim to address the underlying causes, which may be primary or secondary to other medical conditions.

      "abstract": "Similarly as nearly all processes taking place continuously in the organism pain shows also frequently a circadian rhythm. In 30 patients with ischalgia pain intensity was studied over 24-hour periods during 7 successive days. The patients noted graphically the intensity of pain on a specially prepared scale. In the light of the data obtained from the patients three types of circadian pain rhythm curves were isolated. In 83,3% of cases the co urse of pain had an evident circadian rhythm returning during successive days. In 19 cases (63.3%) pain was particularly increased in the evening and night hours. In 6 cases (20%) the peak intensity of pain was in the morning hours (5-10 a.m.). In the remaining 5 cases (16%) its intensity was unchanged, without any circadian fluctuations. No relationship was demonstrated between pain rhythm and the age, sex, disease duration, spinal radiological changes, sensory or motor deficit. Pain rhythm is individual feature connected, probably, with other rhythmic processes in the organism, particularly with the rhythm of corticosteroid or endorphin release. Increased intensity of pain may be connected with falling level of these substances in the organism. In 35 patients with a significant nocturnal rhythm of ischalgic pain a trial was undertaken of treating the pain with dexomethasone administered in the evening hours in the painless period. The doses were 1-2 mg. In nearly 70% of cases (24 patients) a good effect of this treatment was obtained. This work based exclusively on clinical observations requires further studies and it is regarded by the authors as a preliminary communication.",

      "title": "Nocturnal Enuresis: Current Concepts",
      "abstract": "Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: Nocturnal enuresis affects approximately 5 to 7 million children in the United States, making it the most common pediatric urologic complaint encountered by primary care physicians. Despite its prevalence, nocturnal enuresis remains incompletely understood, which can frustrate patients, family members, and physicians. Appropriate intervention is justified for the affected child because of the potential consequences of family stress, social withdrawal, and poor self-esteem.Enuresis refers to the persistence of inappropriate voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated bladder control (age 4 to 5 y at the latest). The development of bladder control is a multidimensional process that requires sensory awareness of bladder fullness by the child, capacity for storage of urine, voluntary control of the bladder sphincter, psychological desire for control, and a positive training experience. Diurnal enuresis is involuntary leaking of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal enuresis refers to involuntary passage of urine during sleep and is classified as primary (no prior period of sustained dryness) or secondary (recurrence of nighttime wetting after 6 mo or longer of dryness). Recent urology literature describes another classification of nocturnal enuresis based on the presence or absence of other bladder symptoms. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) is defined as a normal void occurring at night in bed in the absence of any other symptoms referable to the urogenital tract, and it precludes any daytime symptomatology. It is the focus of this article. Polysymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is bed-wetting associated with other bladder symptoms such as urgency, frequency,instability, or voiding dysfunction. Investigations of patients who have MNE reveal that they are clearly different from patients who have PNE.The spontaneous resolution rate of nocturnal enuresis is approximately 15% per year, with 1% of teenagers at 15 years of age still wetting the bed (Fig. 1). Parents may become concerned about nocturnal enuresis when their child reaches 5 to 6 years of age and is preparing to enter school. Most children are not concerned until 7 to 8 years of age. Approximately 80% to 85% of children who have nocturnal enuresis have MNE. Another 5% to 10% of cases meet the definition of PNE, with daytime wetting or other bladder symptoms. Organic causes are responsible for nocturnal enuresis in fewer than 5% of cases. Such organic causes must be searched for and ruled out if the history suggests their presence. There is a slight male predominance (about 60% overall) for nocturnal enuresis. Etiologic factors contributing to MNE include genetics, sleep arousal dysfunction,urodynamics, nocturnal polyuria, psychological components, and maturational delay. That the condition probably is multifactorial, with various contributing factors in any one patient, confounds attempts to base therapeutic approaches on etiology.A hereditary basis for nocturnal enuresis has been suspected for years. Studies of twins show a concordance rate of 43% to 68% for monozygotic and 19% to 36% for dizygotic twins. Seventy percent of children who have enuresis have a parent who has a history of the disorder. Studies indicate that if one parent had enuresis, the probability of a child having it is approximately 40% to 45%. If both parents were affected, the probability of a child having the condition increases to 70% to 77%. If neither parent had enuresis, only 15% of offspring will have enuresis. Chromosomes 12q, 13q, and 22 all have been named as possible locations of a gene(s) resulting in enuresis, but a specific mechanism for enuresis related to a gene locus is not known.The association between the presence of a full bladder and the sensation in the brain of a full bladder occurs in most children by the age of 5 years,which correlates with the normative standard in the United States for nocturnal dryness in 85% of 5-year-olds. Concurrently, by this age the child's pattern of several sleep/wake cycles daily, known as multiphasic sleep, has changed to a single period of sleep daily, known as monophasic sleep. Daytime urination control usually occurs first,followed by learning to arouse during sleep to the sensation of a full bladder. Many parents report that a child who has enuresis is more difficult to arouse from sleep than are other children in the home, but sleep studies have not documented a convincing association between a child's sound sleep and a nocturnal wetting episode.The relationship of sleep patterns with enuresis is an area of active research. In some studies, the enuretic event seemed to occur during nonREM sleep and could occur during any part of the night. In others,enuresis reportedly was caused by a mild disturbance in arousal, based on the finding that activation of the arousal center proceeded correctly, but the transition from light sleep to complete awakening was not achieved properly. In a subset of patients, the arousal center in the brain failed to activate, despite proper full bladder sensation. There is conflicting evidence that children who have enuresis may exhibit other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and night terrors. A recurrent theme in sleep research is the child's inability to recognize the sensation of a full bladder during sleep and failure to awaken from sleep to urinate in an appropriate place. There appears to be a maturational pattern of progressive central nervous system \"recognition\" of bladder fullness and control over the micturition reflex.Some children who have enuresis may have a small bladder capacity. Functional bladder capacity in children may be estimated by the formula: age in years plus 2, which gives bladder capacity in ounces. By adolescence, this no longer applies; adult bladder capacity is approximately 10 to 15 oz. Children who have small bladder capacities probably represent a subgroup of patients who have MNE and presumably cannot hold the normal amount of urine produced at night. They are more likely to report frequent daytime voiding,some nights with multiple episodes of enuresis per night, and no history of attaining dryness.In some children who have normal bladder capacities,urgency may play a role in nocturnal enuresis. These children exhibit daytime urgency, but they can maintain bladder control during the day. They have a pattern of partial emptying of the bladder that results in frequent daytime urination to maintain continence and enuresis occurring at night when they cannot void as often. No evidence supports abnormal urodynamics in children who have MNE. Involuntary nighttime voiding in those who have MNE occurs with a urodynamically normal bladder at functional capacity. Because most patients who have abnormal urodynamics as an underlying cause for their nighttime enuresis also have daytime symptoms, asking patients about daytime voiding patterns in the initial history is important.Polyuria is defined as excessive urine production. It may be associated with chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Caffeine,alcohol, and medications also may cause it. Factors such as irregular food and drink intake and staying up late also may contribute. It seems reasonable to limit fluid intake several hours prior to bedtime because the most common cause of polyuria is habit polydipsia.Since first described in 1985, the theory that MNE is due to nocturnal polyuria with relative nocturnal deficiency of pituitary-produced antidiuretic hormone(ADH) has been controversial. Early studies reported that the plasma level of ADH did not increase during sleep in those who had enuresis compared with a rise in ADH among unaffected children, resulting in relative nocturnal polyuria as a factor in enuresis. Studies documenting the percentage of children who have enuresis and lack a nocturnal surge in ADH ranges from 25% to 100%, suggesting the presence of other factors. New research about polyuria and enuresis theorizes that a full bladder might communicate with the kidneys to reduce urine production. Some recent investigations also suggest abnormal osmoregulatory function in the kidney, with higher solute excretion among those who have enuresis.Most children who have enuresis have no psychological disorder. The dated concept that enuresis frequently is due to anxiety or stress is unproven. On the contrary, enuresis creates psychosocial problems for the bed-wetting child, including poor self-esteem,family stress, and social isolation. Secondary enuresis commonly has been attributed to psychological factors. Recent studies show no major psychological differences between children who have secondary enuresis and children who have no enuresis. If a child reverts to bed-wetting during treatment for enuresis or has increased episodes of bed-wetting during times of stress, it is more likely due to poor compliance with treatment. Children who have enuresis not only have lower self-esteem than unaffected children, but they have lower self-esteem than children who have chronic,debilitating illnesses. These study results both emphasize the profound impact that enuresis may have and justify a careful evaluation of psychosocial symptoms in the family and the patient.The fact that most children who have enuresis become dry in time with or without intervention supports maturational delay as a factor in MNE. At age 5 years,15% of children occasionally wet the bed compared with only 10% at 6 years of age. Perhaps development of central nervous system recognition of and response to the sensation of a full bladder is delayed, a concept that correlates strongly with the arousal dysfunction theory. Proposed abnormal urodynamic factors also may normalize as the child becomes older. A similar process of maturation over time is seen in other milestones of normal development,such as the age range of 9 to 15 months at which a child begins to walk. Maturational delay may be the most plausible and unifying concept among proposed etiologic factors in MNE.In addition to a detailed toilet training history, a family history of enuresis should be sought because it rarely is volunteered, even when known by a parent. Other pertinent details of a history include the onset and pattern of wetting, voiding behavior, sleep pattern, parasomnias, medical conditions, daytime urinary symptoms, bowel habits, and psychosocial factors. It also is important to assess both the family's and the patient's attitude toward the bed-wetting and their readiness to initiate and continue treatment. Questions about voiding patterns may reveal urgency or a history of small, frequent voids that suggests bladder instability or small bladder capacity. Organic causes of enuresis may be apparent by a history of dysuria (urinary tract infection),polyuria and polydipsia (diabetes insipidus or mellitus), encopresis (constipation), abnormal urine stream (lower obstructive lesions), gait disturbances(spinal cord pathology), or nighttime snoring(adenoidal hypertrophy). A thorough and thoughtful history is the means by which the infrequent organic causes of enuresis are separated from the majority of cases that have no organic etiology (TableT1). Most children who have nocturnal enuresis will have normal findings on physical examination. In addition to assessing the child's height, weight, and blood pressure, perform a complete examination, paying careful attention to the urogenital, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems. A palpable bladder or palpable stool may be present on abdominal examination, ectopic ureter or signs of sexual abuse on urogenital examination, or abnormal gait apparent during neurologic examination. Cremasteric, anal, abdominal,and deep tendon reflexes that reflect spinal cord function all should be tested. The skin of the lower back should be inspected for the presence of a sacral dimple, hair patches, or vascular birthmarks, which can be clues to spinal dysraphism. Mouth breathing may suggest sleep apnea with associated enuresis due to adenoidal hypertrophy. Direct observation of the urinary stream in the office is important, especially if findings on the history suggest an abnormality. The family can measure bladder capacity at home prior to the initial evaluation or it can be measured in the office by having the child drink 12 oz of fluid on arrival, then voiding into a calibrated cup.All children who have enuresis should have urinalysis of a clean-catch midstream urine specimen (Fig 2). The ability to concentrate urine to 1.015 or greater rules out diabetes insipidus and the absence of glucose rules out diabetes mellitus as causes of nocturnal enuresis. Further laboratory testing is unnecessary for MNE. A urine culture should be obtained for symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection on history or findings on urinalysis. Routine radiologic or ultrasonographic imaging studies of the urinary tract or cystoscopy are not recommended for children who have MNE. PNE may require further evaluation with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), renal and bladder ultrasonography, or urodynamic testing. When enuresis is resistant to treatment and the history suggests a sleep disorder, a sleep study may be useful to look for sleep apnea or parasomnias.An important factor in any pediatric treatment is the child's motivation and acceptance. Parents also must support the child and the treatment program for maximal effectiveness. The child's age is a critical factor when formulating a treatment plan. Consideration of treatment is guided by the clinician's understanding of the changing prevalence of enuresis in school-age children and the effect of enuresis on the child's self-esteem and family function. Timing of the intervention should be tailored to the individual child and family.Although a child's self-esteem can be harmed by MNE, even at early school age, the effects are variable. Some school-age children and their parents are not bothered by the child's enuresis; others experience anxiety and stress. It is reasonable to discuss MNE during a health supervision visit and provide facts for families of patients at 6 or 7 years of age. The maturational aspects of nighttime awakening to void should be explained to parents and likened to other familiar developmental milestones that occur over a range of time rather than at a specific age. Providing plausible medical explanations, identifying a family history of enuresis, and defining its age-specific prevalence may lessen the burden on the child. Parents should understand that punishment or negative reinforcement is counterproductive, both in resolving the enuresis and in protecting the child's self-esteem. For children and families who are bothered by the child's enuresis,targeted intervention is recommended by age 8 years at the latest. In general, MNE should be thoroughly explained, selectively treated, and never ignored.This approach begins with educating parents and the child about enuresis, a process that usually allays guilt. Handouts with printed instructions can teach the parents and the child to manage the condition. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that he or she is dry. The child should be taken out of diapers or training pants and encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. The risk of secondary psychological injury to the child's self-esteem is minimized by discouraging ridicule from siblings and by avoiding a critical, demoralizing approach.Because excessive fluid intake before bedtime can cause increased nocturnal urine production, as can caffeinated beverages and certain foods (eg, dairy products, citrus juices, chocolate), restricting fluids for 2 hours prior to bedtime is reasonable. The child should agree to fluid restriction, however, rather than having it imposed. The rate of complete resolution of enuresis with motivational therapy alone is estimated to be only 25%, but up to 70% of children who have MNE have some reduction in the number of wet nights. Once consistently dry nights are achieved, the reported relapse rate is low. Motivational therapy is a reasonable first-line approach, especially with the younger child. If unsuccessful after a trial of 3 to 6 months, a different treatment program should be considered.This approach includes dry-bed training and classic conditioning therapy using an enuresis alarm system. Hypnotherapy also may be part of a comprehensive program to treat enuresis. This therapy involves an age-appropriate explanation of how the brain and bladder communicate, taking the mystery out of enuresis by educating the patient and family, teaching relaxation techniques, and having the child practice imagery of awakening to urinate in the toilet or staying dry all night. It can be combined with an alarm system. Frequent office visits are required initially until the physician is certain that the child can practice imagery at home; then, visits may be monthly. Referral to a behavioral pediatrician or clinic may be necessary if the primary care physician does not have the necessary training or time for this approach.Dry-bed training (as described by Azrin and Thienes in 1978) involves waking the child on a progressive schedule at decreasing intervals over several nights,having the child change pajamas and bedding if wet or walk to the toilet when voiding is needed. As in the use of alarm therapy, the eventual goal is to have the child self-awaken to void. Although a high cure rate is reported with this technique by the authors, it is a more time- and labor-intensive process than most families are willing to undertake.Enuresis alarms have the highest overall cure rate of any available treatment. They also represent the best-researched behavioral intervention. Alarm systems can be used in combination with motivational and other behavioral therapy techniques or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Several different alarm devices range in cost from $50 to $75. Insurance companies may cover an enuresis alarm with a prescription from the physician describing it as a medical device. In contrast to the older bell-and-pad type of alarms, the new devices are portable, small,and worn directly on the child's clothing. They emit a transistorized audio or vibratory alarm when urine is sensed in the underpants.Alarms are most effective when combined with other behavioral or pharmacologic therapy. The alarm wakes the child or parent from sleep, who then implements the appropriate component of the behavioral program. The alarm allows the parent and child to intervene and monitors bed-wetting as the program proceeds. Parents and child should be told that this treatment requires a long-term commitment and may take several months to achieve a cure. The device can be discontinued when the child has had three consecutive weeks of dry nights. The cure rate may be as high as 70% long-term. Among the 10% to 15% of children who relapse,most can be treated successfully with a repeat of the original alarm program.Methods to reduce alarm failure include pretesting the child for his or her ability to awaken to the alarm and encouraging parents and child to continue using the alarm. Failure also can be reduced by enabling the child who is afraid of the dark to walk to the toilet using a flashlight or night light in the room or by offering other options to the child who is reluctant to try an enuresis alarm. If a child does not awaken to the alarm during pretesting, dry-bed training or parent awakening should precede the use of the alarm. One study showed that an ordinary alarm clock used with dry-bed training was as effective as an enuresis alarm. This may be an attractive alternative to families who cannot afford an alarm or whose insurance will not cover it.(See the 1997 Pediatrics in Review article by Schmitt for practical tips on successful use of the enuresis alarm.)Medication is an attractive treatment modality for parents who hope for relatively effortless success. However, medication alone for initial treatment of nocturnal enuresis is never preferred and seldom should be considered before 8 years of age, even in combination therapy. Three drugs are used most commonly for the treatment of enuresis: imipramine, desmopressin(DDAVP), and oxybutynin. Imipramine and DDAVP have been evaluated in the treatment of MNE; oxybutynin is used primarily in polysymptomatic enuresis.Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used for more than 3 decades to treat nocturnal enuresis. It appears to increase bladder capacity through a weak anticholinergic effect and also may decrease detrusor muscle contractions via noradrenergic effects. The starting dose is 25 mg taken 1 hour before bedtime for children ages 6 to 8 years and 50 to 75 mg for older children and adolescents. The duration of action is 8 to 12 hours. The dose may be increased in 25-mg increments weekly up to 75 mg. Therapy may continue from 3 to 9 months, with a slow tapering of medication recommended over 3 to 4 weeks in 25-mg decrements. Imipramine is relatively inexpensive,and the clinical response is usually apparent during the first week of treatment. The initial success rate(dry at 6 months posttreatment) is reported to be 15% to 50%, but the relapse rate is high following drug discontinuation.When used at the recommended dosage, mild side effects include irritability, dry mouth, decreased appetite, headaches, and sleep disturbances. An accidental or intentional overdose, however, can have serious and potentially lethal effects, including ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Because of its narrow toxic/therapeutic ratio, some clinicians are understandably reluctant to use imipramine to treat a relatively benign, self-limiting condition such as nocturnal enuresis. If imipramine therapy is selected,the physician must counsel the family carefully about the dangerous potential of its accidental ingestion,safe storage of the drug, and supervision of the child taking the medication.DDAVP is a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin (ADH). Acting on the distal tubules of the kidney, it increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, producing a more concentrated, lower volume of urine. The use of DDAVP to treat nocturnal enuresis is based on the observation that some children who have enuresis do not have the normal nocturnal rise in ADH production, potentially leading to polyuria. DDAVP theoretically reduces urine volume at night in such children, who thereby can avoid a full bladder at night.DDAVP is available in an oral form and a nasal spray. The bioavailability is only 1% for the tablet and 10% for the nasal spray. Its duration of action is extended (approximately 10 to 12 h), and it is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa. The initial dose of DDAVP is 20 mcg or one 10-mcg puff in each nostril within 2 hours of bedtime, regardless of the patient's age. The dose may be increased in increments of 10 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 40 mcg. The response to DDAVP usually can be evaluated within a few days of starting therapy. Patients may remain on medication for 3 to 6 months,then should begin a slow decrease of the dose by 10 mcg/mo. If a child remains enuretic after 6 months of therapy, combination therapy may be considered. If oral medication is preferred, the starting dose is 0.2 mg(one tablet) administered 1 hour before bedtime. If there is no response within 1 week, the dose can be titrated by 0.2 mg up to a maximum of 0.6 mg nightly.Side effects of DDAVP are rare and include abdominal discomfort, nausea, headache, and epistaxis. Symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures has been reported very rarely, usually in the context of exceeding the recommended dosage. Nonetheless,nighttime fluid restriction is a reasonable recommendation for those receiving DDAVP. Contraindications include habit polydipsia,hypertension, and heart disease. There are few data on long-term use of DDAVP. In a Swedish study that monitored children who had MNE, 22% became dry with DDAVP, a response not significantly different from the spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year. All patients, however, had a marked reduction in the number of enuretic events per month. More patients remained dry after slow tapering of the DDAVP dose than following abrupt discontinuation of the medicine. Various studies show immediate response rates as high as 70% and relapse rates as high as 95%. Moffat et al reviewed 18 controlled studies of DDAVP and found overall that only 25% of children were completely dry on the medicine, with a relapse rate similar to that noted previously.DDAVP's high initial response rate is attractive for episodic use to treat enuresis, alone or in combination with other treatments. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis. DDAVP also may be useful to bridge the gap between enuresis and dryness during other treatments. Using DDAVP episodically also reduces its rather significant cost, which may be $150 to$250 for 1 month of nightly use.Oxybutynin chloride is an anticholinergic and antispasmodic drug that has a role in reducing uninhibited bladder contractions. It is used primarily to treat children who have symptoms of daytime urgency or frequency in addition to nighttime enuresis. It appears to be no better than placebo in treating children who have MNE. Side effects are related to the anticholinergic action of the drug and include flushing, blurred vision, constipation, tremor, and decreased ability to sweat. The recommended starting dose is 5 to 10 mg/d (or 0.1 mg/kg) for most children. This drug is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat enuresis in children younger than 5 years of age. Hyoscyamine is another anticholinergic agent used to treat bladder instability that recently has received attention in clinical studies on enuresis. These medications may play a role in the treatment of PNE.As a condition that has no single etiology and various causal factors in any one patient, it is not surprising that a single method of treating nocturnal enuresis is often of limited success. Age-related strategies that combine more than one treatment may improve response rates.For young children and their parents, reassurance and education about enuresis are of utmost importance. They must understand that nocturnal wetting is not the child's fault. There is no place for ridicule or a punitive approach to the problem by parents, siblings,or peers. Previously described motivational and behavioral methods that assist the child in waking to void and that praise successful dryness suit this age group best.For children who still have nocturnal enuresis at this age and for whom the child and family request an intervention, the enuresis alarm gives the best results in terms of response rate and low relapse rate. This also is the age at which intermittent use of medication such as DDAVP can be useful for special events such as an overnight at a friend's home or a camping trip.Because of the emotional impact of persistent bed-wetting in adolescence, aggressive intervention is indicated. If use of an enuresis alarm does not stop or greatly reduce the wetting episodes, continuous use of medication is justified as additional treatment. When 2 months of dryness using the combination of alarm and medication are achieved, the medication should be tapered gradually while continuing to use the enuresis alarm.Assessments of treatment results of enuresis must consider the rate of initial response, the duration of response, and the relapse rate. In general, studies comparing an alarm system with placebo or drug therapy show the alarm system to have the most favorable combination of initial response rate (60% to 70%) and relapse rate (10% to 30%), especially when dryness is assessed at 12 months after initiating treatment. The success rate with alarms, of course, depends on continued use of the alarm. A significant number of families (30% to 50%) discontinue use of the alarm within only 2 to 3 weeks. Studies evaluating medication alone compared with placebo show favorable initial response(10% to 60%), but a significant relapse rate (80% to 90%) when the child is off medication. Two studies documented identical rates of 56% of children maintaining dryness after 12 months' use of an alarm system. In both studies,the rate of dryness after 12 months when using medication alone, either imipramine or DDAVP, was no better than the expected improvement rate of about 15% with no treatment.Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem seen by the primary care physician. It remains a source of considerable anxiety for the child, parents, and sometimes the pediatrician. In spite of several decades of research, no single explanation or classification of enuresis is sufficient. The nocturnal wetting episode occurs when the child does not awaken during sleep at a time when urine volume exceeds functional bladder capacity, due either to excess urine production, small bladder capacity, or both. This perspective requires the practitioner to take a careful history for polyuria, sleep dysfunction, and daytime bladder symptoms to devise the best treatment for each child. Once organic causes are ruled out by careful history and physical examination, no laboratory or radiographic evaluation is necessary beyond a simple urinalysis. Although a spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year can be expected, intervention may benefit some children through earlier attained dryness and improved self-esteem. Behavior therapies, including alarm systems, have the best long-term results, but they require strong family commitment and do not offer immediate results. Medication has a better short-term cure rate than motivational/behavioral therapy, but relapse rates are high when drugs are discontinued. A combination of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is reasonable if monotherapy fails. The ultimate goal is for the child to maintain nighttime dryness or to self-awaken to void at night.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "abstract": "Hypersomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness are commonly encountered by physicians dealing with sleep medicine.Although these are common symptoms associated with sleep disorders, they can be ignored.The tendency of excessive daytime sleepiness, which might be caused by sleep deprivation that continues for a while in our society, makes it difficult to diagnose diseases with hypersomnia.Hypersomnia is used as a comprehensive definition for excessive daytime sleepiness and/or excessive need for sleep or increased amount of sleep.Clinically, it presents with prolonged sleep times at night, falling asleep easily and everywhere, recurrent sleep attacks, and excessive daytime sleepiness.Hypersomnia can be either a symptom of neurological and metabolic diseases, especially sleep disorders, or develop due to substance, drug use, and trauma.Sleep attacks occurring during the day can affect individuals' academic or professional performance, disrupt their cognitive functions and social relations, and cause life-threatening traffic or work accidents.It is crucial to examine this symptom, which causes a significant deterioration in the quality of life of people, and to diagnose and treat the diseases causing it.This review article plans to address the epidemiological, pathophysiological, clinical aspects of sleep disorders that cause hypersomnia, treatment and emphasize the critical points in the differential diagnosis.",

Frequency increases with age. A case of a 89-year old man is reported who was sent to hospital because of a state of confusion. He fell asleep all day with periods of restlessness during night. Sleep-related apnoeas could already be observed during daytime. Cardiopulmonary daytime diagnostics did not reveal any abnormal findings. Polysomnographic measurements, however, showed an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 37.8 apnoeas/hypopnoeas per hour with predominantly central apnoeas. Pernasal application of 1 litre of oxygen per minute during sleep normalised breathing patterns, daytime sleepiness, and the nighttime states of confusion stopped. Consequently, sleep-related disorders of breathing have to be considered in the differential diagnostics of unclear states of confusion in old age. In these cases polysomnography is indicated even in geriatric patients.",

Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

Primary nocturnal enuresis describes those children who have always been wet. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is defined as a relapse after a child has been completely dry for at least six months. Up to the age of nine years, nocturnal enuresis is twice as common in boys than girls but thereafter there is no sex difference in prevalence. At the age of five, 2% of children wet every night, and 1% are still wetting every night in their late teens. Bedwetting is not primarily caused by an underlying psychological disorder However, psychological problems and life events can exacerbate or precipitate bedwetting in susceptible children who have a genetic basis for their condition. The three systems approach to the management of the condition addresses: poor arousal from sleep, nocturnal polyuria and bladder dysfunction. Bedwetting is occasionally caused by underlying medical conditions; primarily urological, neurological, or metabolic. It can also be associated with obstructive sleep apnoea. However, these causes are uncommon in primary enuresis. A basic history and examination should exclude these conditions. If the bedwetting has started in the past few days or weeks, systemic illness should be considered e.g. UTI, diabetes mellitus. With secondary enuresis, symptoms or signs of medical and psychological conditions or life events may be elicited as possible causes, and may need separate treatment. Alarm treatment should be considered in any child over seven. The alarm takes several weeks to be effective and needs commitment from both child and carers. Desmopressin may be used as first-line treatment if rapid onset and/or short-term improvement is the priority of treatment or an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable.",

Assessment should: ... Normal sleep variations and younger children Around 1/4 of 1-year-olds will still be night-waking several times per week and many will still be waking occasionally at 5 years. Breast-fed children wake more. The point at which night-waking becomes a problem may be to some extent dependent on parental attitude and tolerance. Parasomnias Parasomnias are defined as an intrusion into sleep without a reduction in sleep length. In the preschool age group these will usually be night terrors or variants of somnambulism (sleepwalking). The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning. Night terrors usually occur in the first few hours after going to bed [a non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia]",

Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient.",

Circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep pressure are the determining factors in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Fluctuations in hormone levels are largely determined by circadian rhythms. The central biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is synchronized with external signals, and largely determines the daily rhythms of hormone secretion. Many hormones can affect respiratory function during sleep, exacerbating sleep apnea when their secretion is excessive or deficient. Sleep disorders can occur in a number of neuroendocrine diseases, worsening the quality of life of patients and, in some cases, contributing to the development of life-threatening complications. Screening for sleep disorders, in particular the active detection of sleep apnea in acromegaly, hypothyroidism and hypercorticism, can significantly reduce the risk of complications with timely treatment.",

Sleep disorder can cause many complications, including the worsening of the brain injury prognosis. Insomnia occurs in 29% traumatic brain injury patient. Insomnia suspected due injury in inferior frontal, anterior temporal including basal forebrain, also sympathetic nerve hyperactivity. Insomnia increase the risk of stroke, disability and mood disturbance. Hypersomnia occurs in 28% traumatic brain injury patients. Hypersomnia suspected due orexin decrease and injury in sleep promoting area. Hypersomnia suspected related to recovery, less activity time and accident due sleepiness. There are no prevalence data of circadian rhythm disturbance after traumatic brain injury. This disturbance is caused by injury in supra-chiasmatic nucleus and related to global worsening on the patient. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly linked with injury area, but hypersomnia is not particularly linked to any area and only related to orexin decrease. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly related to the worsening condition on the patient, but hypersomnia is associated with recovery and not particularly related to any disturbances. It is hoped that understanding the sleep disorder after traumatic brain injury can rise the alertness of this matter and encourage clinicians to increase the quality of sleep disorder due to traumatic brain injury management. Cedera kepala merupakan salah satu cedera yang umum terjadi. Cedera ini sering diikuti dengan gangguan tidur seperti insomnia, hipersomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian. Gangguan ini sering dapat menyebabkan berbagai komplikasi termasuk memperparah penyembuhan cedera kepala. Insomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 29%. Insomnia diduga disebabkan oleh cedera pada daerah inferior frontal, anterior temporal termasuk basal otak depan, juga peningkatan kerja saraf simpatis. Insomnia meningkatkan resiko stroke, disabilitas dan gangguan suasana hati. Hipersomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 28%. Hipersomnia diduga akibat penurunan orexin dan akibat kerusakan pada area yang mempertahankan bangun. Hipersomnia diduga berhubungan dengan penyembuhan, waktu tersita akibat tidur dan kecelakaan akibat mengantuk. Belum ada data prevalensi gangguan ritme sirkadian setelah cedera kepala. Gangguan ini disebabkan oleh cedera pada nukleus suprakiasmatik dan sering dikaitkan dengan perburukan kondisi pasien. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian sering dihubungkan dengan lokasi tertentu dari cedera, namun hipersomnia berhubungan dengan kadar orexin dan tidak terlalu dikaitkan terhadap area tertentu. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian berhubungan dengan perburukan, namun hipersomnia bisa menandakan perbaikan dan tidak berhubungan signifikan dengan gangguan lainnya. Diharapkan dengan memahami gangguan tidur ini dapat meningkatkan kewaspadaan bagi para klinisi dan mendorong untuk penelitian berikutnya sehingga penanganan pasien gangguan tidur akibat cedera kepala dapat menjadi lebih baik.",

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

Sleep related elevations of pulmonary arterial pressure were not influenced by atropine or impaired autonomic functions.

      "abstract": "Several studies over the years have demonstrated that sleep complaints in general, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in particular, tend to be more prevalent among women. The 2007 Sleep in America poll of women age 40–60 years old found that 20% reported sleepiness that interfered with daily life (Chasens et al., Behav Sleep Med 8(3):157–71, 2010). This chapter discusses EDS due to primary sleep disorders other than Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) including Narcolepsy, Recurrent Hypersomnia, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Behaviorally Induced Insufficient Sleep Syndrome as well as Hypersomnia Due to Medical condition and Hypersomnia Due to Drug or Substance. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the tetrad of EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnapompic hallucinations. Recurrent hypersomnia is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia often associated with other symptoms that typically last weeks or months apart. Episodes usually last a few days to several weeks and appear one to ten times a year. Sleep and general behavior must be normal between episodes. Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) and Menstrual-related hypersomnia are two distinct clinical subtypes of recurrent hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by constant and severe excessive sleepiness. Naps are typically unrefreshing and post-awakening confusion (sleep drunkenness) is often reported. EDS is a very prevalent problem in developed societies. Women tend to complain more of EDS than men. This prevalence may partially be due to greater sleep deprivation, hormonal factors, and the higher incidence of some primary and secondary sleep disorders in women.",

      "title": "Treating Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The Counselor's Role",
      "abstract": "Each morning, five to seven million children wake up in a wet bed because of primary nocturnal enuresis, i.e., nighttime bedwetting. Because of the intense embarrassment and inconvenience associated with this behavior, many parents are highly motivated to seek help for the problem by consulting with counselors and other practitioners. This article provides the counselor background information and treatment approaches to effectively help such children and parents. Each morning in the United States five to seven million children wake up in a wet bed due to nighttime bedwetting (Warzak, 1993; Nemours Foundation, 1997). Untreated, this condition can lead to serious social and psychological problems. The medical community labels this behavior as primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) or nocturnal urinary incontinence. To qualify for a diagnoses of PNE, the voiding of urine must occur at least twice a week for at least three months, or else must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Medical authorities agree that urinary control begins around age three in the average child and that bedwetting is not considered to be a behavioral or medical problem unless it persists after the age of five (for females) or six (for males) (Warzak, 1993). Approximately 15% of children are so affected (National Enuresis Society, 1995). It should be noted that bedwetting is not considered to be a problem if it occurs only occasionally after the age three or when the child is ill. Interestingly, enuresis tends to run in families; 85% of children seen at one major enuresis clinic had a relative with enuresis and 57% had a parent or sibling with enuresis (Nemours Foundation, 1997). Two-thirds of enuretic children are male (Mikkelsen, 1988) and the problem is more common in lower socio-economic groups and among families with low educational levels (Miller, 1993). To better comprehend PNE, it is helpful to understand the normal development of bladder control. Babies normally void 12 to 16 times per day. By ages 1 to 2 they develop an awareness of a full bladder. By ages 2 to 4 the average child recognizes the sensation of voiding and develops the ability to hold-on. By ages 4 to 5 the child can initiate voiding voluntarily even before the bladder is full. Finally, the average 6 to 7 year old child can hold as necessary and void at any degree of filling (Pediatric Database, 1993). Bedwetting is then diagnosed as primary enuresis if the child is over 5 years and has never stopped bedwetting, and is referred to as secondary enuresis if the child had stopped for at least 6 months and then started again. Diurnal enuresis is the term given to bedwetting during waking hours. Primary enuresis is by far the most common type (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Research also suggests that most bedwetting stops on its own by adolescence but may persist into adulthood unless treated. (Mikkelsen, 1988). Early treatment is recommended because it can prevent the social and psychological problems that can arise if parents elect to just let him or her outgrow it. Causes of the Problem Experts disagree as to the cause of enuresis (Miller, 1993; National Enuresis Society, 1995). Medical theories, behavioral theories and psychological theories are proposed. The medical community views primary nocturnal enuresis as a problem of maturation and/or physiology (Vogel, Young and Primack, 1996). Small bladders or especially deep sleep have been blamed but research has shown that many children with PNE have normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns that are no different from those of non-bed-wetting children (National Enuresis Society, 1995). The counseling and psychology communities treat the problem as a deficiency in self-control skills, whether caused by physiological, behavioral or cognitive components (Ronen, Rahav and Wozner, 1995) and one which is often aggravated by social reactions toward the child (Mala, 1995). …",

Detailed clinical description of sleep function and its study with the use of modern instrumental methods is important for timely and differential diagnosis of mental disorders in PTSD patients. 21 war veterans fighting in \"hot spots were observed during treatment in the specialized department of psychological rehabilitation, Samara Regional Clinical Hospital for War Veterans. After clinical interview the overnight polysomnography \"Sagura-2000\" (PSG) was performed. Sleep disorders in PTSD patients are characterized by the complex of subjective, clinical and neurophysiological symptoms: Superficial sleep (restless, lack of deep sleep); Increased motor activity during sleep (number of activations of the paradoxical phase of sleep to those of deep sleep); Nightmares; Specific (defensive) movements during sleep; Frequent nocturnal awakening (increased number and duration of awakenings); The excess of REM sleep. PSG identified the most frequently related nightmares neurodynamic phenomena: Deficiency of the deep sleep (stages 3 and 4 NREM); Up to 70% of the time NREM takes stage 2 sleep; The increase in motor and EEG activations; The number of activations of the REM than those of NREM; The increase in total REM sleep time; Increasing episodes of REM sleep. Further studies are required to clarify polysomnographic sleep changes, in particular, role of REM sleep dysregulation and treatment of sleep disorders in PTSD.

The hierarchy for sleep is as follows: Best is good quality natural sleep, second best is pharmacologically enhanced good quality sleep, worst is insufficient or poor quality sleep. The tools: sleep hygiene; pain control; psychological counseling and training, for example, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia; and sleep medications such as zolpidem (Ambien), Eszopiclone (Lunesta) Melatonin, and trazodone, which are helpful and relatively safe in concussion patients. Avoid whenever possible medications that can impair recovery and cognitive function, such as benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, and alcohol as a sleep aide. If there are concerns, refer to a sleep medicine clinic for consultation and a formal sleep study; patients may not be reliable historians with regard to their own sleep habits.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS. With any form of sleep-related dissociative disorder, onset can be gradual and sporadic in nature. Females are reported to be affected predominantly, and onset can range from childhood to midlife. Sexualized and frankly sexual behaviors can emerge with sleep-related dissociative disorders. There are several potential considerations for differential diagnosis of sleep-related dissociative disorders, including an NREM arousal disorder parasomnia, parasomnia associated with REM sleep, or nocturnal seizures.",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "title": "Public health and insomnia: economic impact.",
      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

Approximately 4 percent of adult men and 2 percent of adult women are believed to have these conditions. In addition to having symptoms such as snoring, headaches, depression, decreased libido and fatigue, patients with sleep apnea are at risk for a range of severe complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep. Diagnosis may require an overnight polysomnogram in addition to the history, a physical examination and a laboratory assessment. Less cumbersome diagnostic modalities are being developed. Treatment options include weight reduction, change in sleeping position, avoidance of sedatives, use of continuous positive airway pressure and surgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.",

Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "abstract": "The nocturnal eating syndrome (NES) is a nocturnal sleep disorder caused by repeated awakening and the inability to fall a sleep again unless the patient ingests some food or drinks something. In children the NES is frequent, in adults rather rare and may be associated with various pathological conditions. The latter include in particular somnabulism, periodic movements of the lower extremities, narcolepsy, chronic triazolam intoxication, probably anorexia nervosa, and other eating disorders. The authors submit two case-histories of middle aged women (30 and 37 years old) without disturbances of the day-time eating behaviour, without obvious psychopathology where the symptomatology of NES developed slowly from the age of 14 and 25 years resp. Both patients ate at night small amounts of easily consumed foods which they went to fetch in the kitchen as often as five times per night. Their behaviour was calm and aimed. Usually they did not remember the nocturnal eating. Polysomnographic examination in both patients revealed poor sleep with frequent changes of the sleep stages, with frequent awakenings, in both patients incl. even awakening from deep NREM sleep. The authors conclude that in these two patients NES with somnabulism is involved.",

The differential diagnosis of sleep related injury and violence includes: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); NREM sleep parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors); parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnias); obstructive sleep apnea; sexsomnia (sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors); sleep related dissociative disorder; trauma-associated sleep disorder/post-traumatic stress disorder; periodic limb movement disorder; rhythmic movement disorder; nocturnal scratching disorder; nocturnal seizures; and miscellaneous/mixed conditions. Careful clinical interviews, preferably with bed partners participating, and extensive, hospital-based, technologist-attended, overnight video-polysomnography (for one or more nights), is crucial for determining the accurate diagnosis that will guide proper therapy. Most of the disorders mentioned above are classified as parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, with parasomnias defined as abnormal behavioral, experiential and/or autonomic nervous system activity during entry into sleep, during any stage of sleep, and during emergence from any stage of sleep. Parasomnias are often manifestations of \"state dissociation\" in which components of one state of being (wake, REM sleep, NREM sleep) intrude into, and become admixed, with other states of being, with clinical consequences. There are forensic implications related to the parasomnias, with inadvertent and unintentional assaults, murder, and \"pseudo-suicide\" resulting from aggressive and violent behaviors arising from sleep with suspended awareness and judgement.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients. This distribution of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) contrasts with what would be expected if sleep was interrupted by microawakenings, such as in sleep apneas or periodic limb movements, where more light sleep and less deep sleep are commonly observed. This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders. Such a particular sleep pattern could provide insights into the pathophysiology of fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and wake states involve interaction among many brain centers via multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, hypocretin, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (wake promoting), and γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and melatonin (sleep promoting). Most medications for insomnia or hypersomnia act on elements of these neural systems. Initial treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene measures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is useful. Medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for insomnia act on GABA receptors or on melatonin receptors. A frequent cause of insomnia is restless legs syndrome, which is linked to reduced dopaminergic activity in brain structures; idiopathic restless legs syndrome is best treated with dopamine agonists such as ropinerole or pramipexole. Excessive daytime sleepiness is most often due to insufficient sleep hours or sleep apnea but is also caused by medications, illnesses, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia. Stimulants generally act through enhanced dopamine action (amphetamines, methylphenidate) or acetylcholine action (caffeine). Modafinil may act through enhanced central histamine, hypocretin, and possibly dopamine action. A newer agent, γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), acts on GABA and GHB receptors to consolidate sleep, improving daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Improving knowledge of sleep/wake mechanisms should lead to more specific and rational treatments for sleep disorders.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

La perturbation de la distribution circadienne de la veille et du sommeil est proportionnelle a la gravite des signes cliniques et biologiques.

Cependant, le pic est en avance de phase de 2 heures par rapport a celui de sujets africains sains. En conclusion, la maladie du sommeil represente une perturbation du systeme circadien proportionnelle au niveau de gravite clinique de la maladie. La presence de SOREMP et l'avance de phase de la secretion de melatonine sont en faveur d'une perturbation des reseaux serotoninergiques plutot que d'une atteinte directe de l'horloge interne.",

There are three compulsory criteria: localized or generalized pruritus sine materia, chronic pruritus (>6 weeks) and the absence of a somatic cause. Three additional criteria from the following seven items should also be present: a chronological relationship of pruritus with one or several life events that could have psychological repercussions; variations in intensity associated with stress; nocturnal variations; predominance during rest or inaction; associated psychological disorders; pruritus that could be improved by psychotropic drugs; and pruritus that could be improved by psychotherapies.",

The many functions of sleep are still being characterized, and it is clear that sleep is not a passive state but a dynamic condition during which memories are consolidated, restorative hormones are released, and neuronal excitability is modulated.1 Many clinical syndromes of sleep are intertwined with neurologic disorders. The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common. In one study, 2% to 4% of working adults had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), defined as greater than five apneas or hypopneas per hour in association with daytime somnolence.2 2) Neurologic diseases …",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis, with abnormal characteristics of shorter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency. The management of the patients is very important. The present study focused on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods and long-term prognosis of this particular syndrome.The clinical data of 39 narcoleptic children were analyzed. Sleep EEG monitoring was performed in all patients. Among the 39 cases, 23 were followed up.All the patients manifested with excessive daytime sleepiness, with disrupted nocturnal sleep occurring in 35 cases. Cataplexy appeared in 36 cases, and sleep paralysis in 9, hypnagogic hallucination in 19, and automatic behavior in 6 cases, respectively. Sleep EEG monitoring demonstrated a short mean sleep latency (< 5 minutes) and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in 38 cases. Twenty-three of the 39 cases were followed-up. Seventeen cases were followed-up for over one year. The longest follow-up duration was 14 years. Methylphenidate was administered in 10 cases. The excessive daytime sleepiness had been improved in 7 cases (70%). No obvious adverse effects were found. Psychosocial and academic problems appeared in most cases.Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder. A definite diagnosis is established when the symptoms of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness occur in association with the characteristic findings on sleep EEG monitoring. Appropriate drug therapy and psychosocial management are of help for such patients. Stimulant medication is an important component of the overall treatment program. A comprehensive approach is necessary to meet the needs of children with narcolepsy. Family education and emotional support are key elements in the management plan. The overall goal for managing childhood narcolepsy is to assist the child and family in achieving optimal quality of life.",

Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;257:1786-1789)",

Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism.

Five patients sleep through the night, but 1 slept only 3 hours. Two patients had reduced sleep efficiency and slow wave sleep was reduced or absent in 4 patients. No REM sleep disturbances occurred. Two patients had almost no periodic leg movements of sleep (PLMS), 2 had few or no arousals and PLMS indices of 5 or less, and 2 had markedly elevated PLMS and arousal indices. No apneas or significant hypopneas were recorded, but snoring indices were elevated in 2 patients. These findings suggest that sleep apnea is infrequent in unmedicated seizure patients. Some patients may have exaggerated PLMS with arousals, possibly related to epileptiform discharge and perhaps exacerbated by medications, but apparently not due to nocturnal seizures.",

Sleep-onset and maintenance insomnia is a characteristic feature of schizophrenic patients regardless of either their medication status (drug-naive or previously treated) or the phase of the clinical course (acute or chronic). Regarding sleep architecture, the majority of studies indicate that stage 4 sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) latency are reduced in schizophrenia, whereas REM sleep duration tends to remain unchanged. Insomnia in schizophrenic patients could be partly related to the presumed over-activity of the dopaminergic system. However, there is a possibility that the GABAergic system is also involved in sleep disturbance in schizophrenia. Since many signal transmission systems within the CNS can be implicated in the reduction of REM latency in schizophrenia, the characterization of the neurotransmitter systems involved remains a challenging dilemma.",

      "abstract": "Summary Insufficient sleep syndrome possibly represents the worldwide leading cause of daytime sleepiness, but remains poorly recognised and studied. The aim of this case series is to comprehensively describe a cohort of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome. Eighty‐two patients were studied concerning demographic and socio‐economic features, medical, psychiatric and sleep comorbidities, substance use, sleep symptoms, actigraphy, video‐polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests and treatment. The typical patient with insufficient sleep syndrome is a middle‐aged adult (with no difference of gender), employed, who has a family, often carrying psychiatric and neurological comorbidities, in particular headache, anxiety and depression. Other sleep disorders, especially mild sleep apnea and bruxism, were common as well. Actigraphy was a valuable tool in the characterisation of insufficient sleep syndrome, showing a sleep restriction during weekdays, associated with a recovery rebound of night sleep during weekends and a high amount of daytime sleep. An over‐ or underestimation of sleeping was common, concerning both the duration of night sleep and daytime napping. The average daily sleep considering both daytime and night‐time, weekdays and weekends corresponds to the recommended minimal normal duration, meaning that the burden of insufficient sleep syndrome could mainly depend on sleep fragmentation and low quality. Sleep efficiency was elevated both in actigraphy and video‐polysomnography. Multiple sleep latency tests evidenced a tendency toward sleep‐onset rapid eye movement periods. Our study offers a comprehensive characterisation of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome, and clarifies their sleeping pattern, opening avenues for management and treatment of the disorder. Current options seem not adapted, and in our opinion a cognitive‐behavioural psychotherapy protocol should be developed.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

      "title": "Consciousness in Non-REM parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep physiology begins with development of the sleep/wake cycle, and the origins of active versus quiet sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle becomes established at 3-6 months. Sleep disorders during infancy commonly include mild, usually self-limited conditions such as sleep-onset association disorder, excessive nighttime feedings, and poor limit-setting. These require behavioral management to avoid long-term deleterious sleep habits. In contrast, other sleep disorders are more ominous, including SIDS, central congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Childhood is generally considered the golden age of sleep, with brief latency to sleep onset, high efficiency, and easy awakening. Yet parasomnias, psychological factors, and sleep disturbances associated with common disorders such as ADHD disrupt the idealistic notion of childhood being a period of unfettered sleep. Adolescents have sleep requirements similar to adults, posing a challenge for them to adapt to school schedules and increasingly demanding lifestyles. Narcolepsy, usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, is a lifelong sleep disorder and has led to the identification of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitter system. Research advances in the complex interrelationships between developmental neurobiology, sleep disorders and behavior will lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep problems and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for sleep disturbances in children.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and typically results from caloric intake in excess of energy expenditure. Sleep-related eating disorder, a parasomnia associated with binge eating during the sleep period, typically with minimal recollection or conscious control, is also associated with weight gain. In some instances, sleep eating episodes may be induced by arousals related to untreated OSA that occur during sleep. A 41-year old male veteran with a medical history of obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism and chronic pain, who was prescribed gabapentin, aripiprazole, prazosin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, meloxicam, methocarbamol and nicotine supplements for these difficulties, presented with complaints of snoring, nightly sleep eating behaviors, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and 40 pounds weight gain over 8 months. The patient’s main concern was sleep eating which had been occurring nightly, for at least two years. Behaviors were characterized by getting up, going to the kitchen and eating whatever was easily available, without preferences for certain types of foods. The patient did not have recollection for these events in the morning. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrated severe OSA with an overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 108.3/hour. Titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) was tolerated well, and the patient was prescribed AutoCPAP 8–14 cmH2O. There was no sleep eating behavior or other parasomnia noted during the polysomnogram. This case highlights the possible associations between sleep eating behaviors and sleep disordered breathing. When these sleep disorders co-occur, it is often difficult to identify which disorder is causal. Longitudinal assessment is required to clarify the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on sleep eating, and whether such treatment has a direct impact on body habitus.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

These symptoms are attributable to disruption of vestibular processing in the temporoparietal cortex or associated limbic structures. Neurological dysfunction at high altitude is usually ascribed to high altitude cerebral edema or acute mountain sickness. However, transient neurological symptoms occur abruptly at more extreme altitudes, often following vigorous exertion, without overt altitude-induced prodromes. These symptoms may be caused by intense neuronal discharge or neuronal synchronization as a feature of epileptic discharges or cortical spreading depression. Transient high altitude neurological dysfunction should be recognized as a separate complication of extreme altitude, distinct from high altitude cerebral edema.",

The EEG, submental EMG and heart rate as well as respiration were recorded continuously during the sleep periods. Eye movements, however, as they are not detectable by electric recording, were observed visually. In our 4 cases of blind children eye movements disappeared during sleep and sleep stages characterized by desynchronized EEG were found to be reduced.

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in REM Sleep Parasomnia",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

There are approximately 20 000 people with narcolepsy in the United Kingdom, 100 000 in the United States. The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

      "abstract": "Background: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder, and it has been increasingly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. Methods: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5% female, 78.6% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m 2 , diabetes 5.8%, hypertension 20.0%, hyperlipidemia 17.9%, heart disease 2.6%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. Results: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13% [SD, 0.28%] vs 6.83% [SD, 0.26%], P = .035). Conclusion: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias comprise the behavioral, experiential, and autonomic nervous system disorders surrounding rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep and can cause injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

Elles s’associent souvent chez un meme individu et pourraient representer des variantes cliniques d’une meme pathologie.Longtemps considerees comme des troubles benins du sommeil, les donnees actuelles soulignent les consequences des parasomnies, avec des mises en danger et un retentissement fonctionnel diurne. Nos trois premiers travaux ont permis une meilleure caracterisation du phenotype et des consequences des parasomnies, en particulier sur le plan de la somnolence et des phenomenes douloureux chroniques. Pres de la moitie des adultes parasomniaques rapportaient une plainte de somnolence diurne excessive associee a une propension marquee au sommeil sur les premieres heures de la journee. Nous retrouvions une frequence elevee de douleurs chroniques, de cephalees et de migraine.

Un modele permet de conceptualiser les mecanismes de la maladie. Chez un patient predispose genetiquement, certaines conditions responsables d’une instabilite du SLP favorisent la survenue d’un eveil dissocie precipite par un stimulus eveillant.

      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a fairly common, yet often unrecognized and underreported condition, experienced by up to 10% of the general population at some point in their lives. This rapid eye movement (REM)-intrusion phenomenon occurs when the muscle atonia from REM sleep pervades into wakefulness. Patients often experience a conscious awareness of their surroundings, coupled with a sense of suffocation and significant clinical distress, usually lasting for seconds up to several minutes. Though it is often associated with narcolepsy, sleep paralysis can be seen in any condition where there is sleep disruption and is most commonly seen in younger patients who have significant sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep. It is also associated with other common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and can be part of the differential diagnosis for numerous other related conditions such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and nocturnal panic attacks. Obtaining a comprehensive sleep history is essential in accurately characterizing episodes, and for determining the underlying etiology. Treatment of sleep paralysis is largely focused on preventing sleep disruption, and with reassurance and education. Pharmacologic therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be considered in severe and refractory cases.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "Sleep structure is qualitatively and quantitatively changed by aging. The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

El diagnóstico se realiza cuando la queja principal es un sueño no reparador o una dificultad para iniciar o mantener el sueño y dura, al menos, tres meses. El objetivo del presente artículo es describir los diferentes modelos del insomnio primario, así como las aproximaciones terapéuticas no farmacológicas derivadas de estos esquemas. Las modalidades más comunes de tratamiento incluyen enfoques de tipo comportamental, control de estímulos, restricción de sueño, higiene de sueño y relajación muscular progresiva. Al ser el insomnio una condición crónica, se recomiendan tratamientos a largo plazo con un alto perfil de seguridad.",

      "title": "Central s sleep a apnoea, p pathogenesis a and ttreatment: a an o overview and p perspective",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general popula- tion is high. Many of the complaints are the result of sleep-related breathing dis- orders, due mainly to the occurrence of obstructive and central apnoeas. Obstructive sleep apnoea is a fully described and well-recognized entity. Central sleep apnoea (CSA) however, has been poorly studied. There is accumulating evidence that central sleep apnoea should be considered as the end of a spectrum. Instability in the breathing pattern is the main under- lying mechanism and is due to the interaction of many factors. Breathing during sleep is dependent on metabolic control and the activity of the respiratory muscles. Decreased chemical drive and/or failing respiratory muscle function are associated with CSA and usually also with ongoing hypoventilation during wakefulness, char- acterized by chronic daytime hypercapnia. Central respiratory drive can also be inhibited by upper airway reflexes. Mostly, however, CSA occurs as the hallmark of unstable breathing during sleep brought about by an overall increase in loop gain (especially in light sleep stages) and the unmasking of a CO 2 threshold. Arousal following central apnoeas acts as an amplification of the instability. Micro electroencephographic (EEG) arousals are often observed as a consequence of CSA. They are responsible for sleep fragmentation and hypersomnolence during the day. The daytime hypersomnolence and complaints of awakenings during sleep in patients with CSA can be striking. CSA can occur in specific pathologies, such as chronic heart failure and (post-traumatic) brain lesions, that are associated with irregular breathing. Treatment strategies are remarkably few in number. Use of nasal ventilation and the inhalation of CO 2 are mainly of theoretical interest, since patients do not often tolerate these more invasive therapies. Drug treatment, especially with aceta- zolamide, is easier to perform. Stimulation of upper airway reflexes, by less inva- sive methods, seems to be promising for the near future.",

      "title": "REM Sleep in Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is mainly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the characteristic feature is abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena. REM sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its dysfunction in narcolepsy.",

The obtained results show that the patients with apnea syndrome sleep very badly, and consequently, shortened sleep latency and frequent body movements, along with apneas, are regarded as the leading polysomnographic symptoms. Vigilance profile during sleep, that is, interchange and frequency of each of sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) are similar in both tested groups. The suppression of restitutive stages of sleep (III, IV, REM) is considered to be a dominant characteristic of vigilance during sleep in obese persons and obese persons with manifest apnea syndrome. Relatively prolonged sleep latency in obese persons without manifest apnea syndrome indicates, however, restitutively higher quality of their nocturnal sleep. Contrary to the patients with apnea syndrome, they do not suffer from excessive evening somnolence, so that their daily alertness and sleep vigilance during night are of a better quality, although the lack of deep and REM sleep is observed in them as well.",

Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "A series of 33 patients with combined (injurious) sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (viz. \"parasomnia overlap disorder\") was gathered over an 8-year period. Patients underwent clinical and polysomnographic evaluations. Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit. Treatment outcome was available for n = 20 patients; 90% (n = 18) had substantial parasomnia control with bedtime clonazepam (n = 13), alprazolam and/or carbamazepine (n = 4), or self-hypnosis (n = 1). Thus, \"parasomnia overlap disorder\" is a treatable condition that emerges in various clinical settings and can be understood within the context of current knowledge on parasomnias and motor control/dyscontrol during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is a significant public health problem, with prevalence in the community estimated to be as high as 18%. Sleepiness is caused by abnormal sleep quantity or sleep quality. Amongst others, multiple neurological, psychological, cardiac and pulmonary disorders may contribute. Risk factors for excessive sleepiness include obesity, depression, extremes of age and insufficient sleep. In the clinical setting, two of the most commonly encountered causes are obstructive sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement disorder. There is continuing discussion of the mechanisms by which these disorders cause daytime symptoms, with intermittent nocturnal hypoxia, sleep fragmentation and autonomic dysregulation identified as important factors. The increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in obese subjects does not fully account for the increased rates of daytime sleepiness in this population and there is evidence to suggest that it is caused by metabolic factors and chronic inflammation in obese individuals. Sleepiness is also more common in those reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders and significantly impacts their quality of life. Clinicians should be aware of factors which put their patients at high risk of daytime sleepiness, as it is a debilitating and potentially dangerous symptom with medico-legal implications. Treatment option should address underlying contributors and promote sleep quantity and sleep quality by ensuring good sleep hygiene. However, stimulant medication may be indicated in some cases to allow for more normal daytime functioning.",

Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal.

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "Major sleep disorders, independent of whether the dominant complaint is excessive daytime sleepiness or initiating or maintaining sleep, include a sleep deprivation component. Awakenings and arousals were defined based on electroencephalographic recordings using central leads. Some investigators tried to define \"awakenings\" behaviorally by analyzing continuous video recordings. Periodic limb movement disorder, originally described by Symonds as \"nocturnal myoclonus\", was questioned as being an epileptic equivalent. Restless legs syndrome is a dysesthesia that presents an important circadian relationship. Objective evaluations of the consequences of the sleep fragmentation are few in number. Most of them have been performed through studies of sleep-disordered breathing syndromes: upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Insomnias are a cause of sleep deprivation. Menopause is also associated with sleep disruption. Often the reaction to this component will lead to a worsening of abnormal sleep, impacting on sleep hygiene, circadian timing of sleep-wake, and/or conditioning against sleep.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Most sleep‐related seizures occur during non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly during stage changes. Sleep‐related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by paroxysmal motor seizures, mainly arising from NREM sleep. Here, we report a patient with SHE who had seven seizures captured on video‐EEG‐polysomnography during REM sleep. Ictal semiology of this patient ranged from brief paroxysmal arousals to hypermotor seizures. On EEG‐polysomnography, the spontaneous arousals were more frequent during REM than NREM sleep, with a considerably higher arousal index in REM sleep (20/hour). While the reason for seizures during REM sleep in this patient is unclear, we speculate that the threshold and mechanisms of arousal during different sleep stages may be related to the occurrence of seizures.

An estimated 82% of men and 92% of women with moderate to severe OSA have not been diagnosed [3]. Sleep apnea events are defi ned as a complete cessation of breathing (apnea) or a marked reduction in airfl ow (hypopnea) during sleep, and are considered clinically relevant if they last more than 10 seconds. The episodes of apneas and hypopneas may persist for 30 to 60 seconds in some individuals. OSA is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, often resulting in oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep. The classic daytime manifestation is excessive sleepiness, and other symptoms such as non-refreshing sleep, poor concentration, and fatigue are commonly reported [4]. OSA is a serious condition that diminishes the quality of life [5] and is also associated with many common comorbidities. Studies have documented an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease in OSA patients [6,7]. It is estimated that the average life span of an untreated OSA patient is 58 years, much shorter than the average life spans of 78 years for men and 83 years for women [8]. The signs and symptoms of OSA are shown in Table 1.",

There was no family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Ictal EEG demonstrated a typical 3 Hz spike-wave pattern, while there were no abnormalities, either in wakefulness or during sleep. The neurodevelopmental examination was unremarkable and MRI of the brain was normal. The attacks disappeared 3 weeks after initiating sodium valproate, and have not reappeared since then (follow-up 3 years and 3 months); today, at 4 years of age, the patient has normal psycho-motor development.

      "title": "Hot off the press: <scp>MRI</scp> sensitivity for transient global amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an idiopathic acute neurological disorder that presents with sudden onset anterograde memory loss. It was first described as a syndrome in 1956 by Courjon and Guyotat1 and also by Bender.2 Fisher and Adams formally described TGA in 1964.3 The usual presentation is a patient between 50 and 70 years of age who is cognitively and neurologically intact but asking repetitive questions and unable to form new memories. Symptoms are short-lived and resolve within 24 h. The incidence has been reported as 23.5 per 100,000 people per year and is more common in people who get migraine headaches.4, 5 TGA is often precipitated by physical or emotional stressors, pain, the Valsalva maneuver, hot or cold water immersion, or sexual intercourse.6 The criterion standard of TGA diagnosis combines seven clinical criteria: the attack is witnessed, there is clear anterograde amnesia, the absence of other neurological symptoms during the attack, the absence of abnormal neurological examination findings, memory loss is less than 24 h, there are no epileptic features or history of same, and there is no recent head injury.7 The workup of TGA can include laboratory testing, EEG, ECG, echocardiography, and advanced neuroimaging. This is a systematic review of observational studies of TGA. It included adult patients with a diagnosis of TGA based on existing clinical criteria who were evaluated with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at varying time intervals (e.g., 0–12 h, 12–24 h) after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of DW-MRI in diagnosis of TGA. DW-MRI had low sensitivity for TGA early after symptom onset, but the sensitivity increased over time. The authors concluded that obtaining a DW-MRI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TGA in the acute setting is likely a low-yield test. This was a good quality systematic review with a relevant diagnostic question, a detailed search strategy, and appropriate assessment of primary studies for common forms of bias. The major limitations of the included studies were the lack of precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals [CIs]) and high heterogeneity for estimates of DW-MRI sensitivity in diagnosing TGA. Heterogeneity as measured by the I2 test was very high at 72%–96% for most measured time points after symptom onset. Another limitation is that all studies included in this systematic review were observational in nature, with no randomized trials allocating patients to any time frame. Furthermore, although there were almost 1700 patients included in this review, there were still very few patients in some of the time points at which MRI was performed. This study also suffered from partial verification bias, also known as referral or workup bias. This occurs when only a certain set of patients who underwent the index test are verified by the reference standard. In this case, only those who met the clinical criteria for TGA had a DW-MRI performed, while patients who did not meet clinical criteria did not have an MRI. This could increase the overall sensitivity reported in the study. Finally, to get an accurate measure of sensitivity and specificity, we need a criterion standard to measure against. TGA is a clinical diagnosis, and the criterion standards used were the defined clinical criteria for the disease. This may be a somewhat uncertain criterion standard. Furthermore, if the criterion standard is clinical, the bedside physician already has access to the criterion standard diagnosis, and it is reasonable to ask what value an MRI could possibly add. Overall, 23 studies with a total of 1688 patients met inclusion criteria. All studies were case series of adult patients who were diagnosed with TGA clinically and who underwent DW-MRI. In the first 12 h from symptom onset, sensitivity of DW-MRI is 15.6%. Sensitivity improves thereafter to ranges as high as 83%, but there are very wide CIs for all point estimates and significant heterogeneity between studies. The Table 1 summarizes sensitivity of DW-MRI as a function of time interval from symptom onset. This study emphasizes the value of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of TGA and the low yield of DW-MRI testing. This is valuable information as it will reduce the unnecessary use of an expensive and time-consuming test in the acute setting. It is possible but unlikely that future prospective and randomized trials will change this. @shawnkdowling: Assuming there are no red flags, I do some basic labs and non-contrast CT head. I'd never considered ordering a DW-MRI and glad I do not need to based on this study. I typically consult neuro if the amnesia has not resolved at 12 h. @iwwalker: Textbook TGA does not need a neuro consult so consulting early likely keeps them unnecessarily in the ED for that, but cannot send them home until resolved regardless. If TGA is going on and on, I would also question the diagnosis, thus the referral. @Kapur_AK: Similar approach here. Our neurologists suggest we refer all as outpatients, which I'm okay with doing. I refer atypical or prolonged presentations in the ED (closer to 4–6 h). Ultimately the conclusion of emergency physicians weighing in on Twitter was not to order MRIs, while outpatient neurology consultation practices were variable. Clinical criteria remain the criterion standard in diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Early imaging with DW-MRI is a low-yield test and should not be performed in the emergency department. The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Low Iron Status: A Possible Risk Factor for First Febrile Seizure",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SEIZURES IN CHILDHOOD: A seizure or convulsion is a paroxysmal, time-limited change in\r\nmotor activity and/or behavior that result from abnormal electrical\r\nactivity in the brain. Seizures are common in the pediatric age group and\r\noccur in approximately 10% of children. Most seizures in children are\r\nprovoked by somatic disorders originating outside the brain, such as high\r\nfever, infection, syncope, head-trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac\r\narrhythmias. Other events, such as breath-holding spells and gastro\r\nesophageal reflux, can cause events that simulate seizures. A few children\r\nalso exhibit psychogenic seizures of psychiatric origin. Less than one\r\nthird of seizures in children are caused by epilepsy, a condition in which\r\nseizures are triggered recurrently from within the brain.\r\nFor epidemiological classification purposes, epilepsy is considered\r\nto be present when two or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval\r\ngreater than 24 hr apart. The cumulative lifetime incidence of epilepsy is\r\n3% and more than half of cases begin in childhood. However, the annual\r\nprevalence of epilepsy is lower (0.5—0.8%) because many children\r\noutgrow epilepsy. Although the outlook for most children with symptomatic seizures\r\nor those associated with epilepsy is generally good, the seizures may\r\nsignal a potentially serious underlying systemic or central nervous system\r\n(CNS) disorder that requires thorough investigation and management. For\r\nchildren with epilepsy, the prognosis is generally good, but 10—20%\r\nhave persistent seizures refractory to drugs and those cases pose a\r\ndiagnostic and management challenge.\r\nSeizures have been recognized since ancient times and although\r\nimprovement has been made in management over this century compared\r\nto the previous 2000 years, there are still far too many children whose\r\nlives are crippled by poorly controlled seizures. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the association between Iron deficiency and the first\r\nfebrile seizure. DISCUSSION: 1. In our study to detect low iron status as a possible risk factor for\r\nfirst febrile seizures 50 cases and 50 age and sex matched controls are\r\nstudied and analyzed .\r\n2. In the present study we found that the peak incidence of febrile\r\nseizure occur during one to two years of age and the mean age is\r\n23.26 months. This is comparable to previous studies. The peak\r\nage of onset being 14-18 months of age as per Nelson textbook of\r\nPediatrics (22). Berg et al. in his study found that the peak\r\nincidence is between 18 and 24 months (12). Similarly Naveedur\r\nRehman et al. reported the peak incidence at 22 Months (18).\r\n3. The present study depicts that the incidence of febrile seizures is\r\nslightly higher in boys than in girls and the male: female ratio 2:1.\r\nThis is similar to the study by Berg et al (12), while Naveedur\r\nRehman et al. reported no gender difference in their study .\r\n4. In our study family history of febrile seizures is seen only in 14%\r\nof cases. But Forfar textbook of pediatrics mentions that 50% will\r\nhave a family history of convulsions and 80% of monozygotic\r\ntwins are concordant for febrile convulsions. 5. The mean serum ferritin level in our study is 27.39ng/ml . It is\r\nsimilar to Daoud AS et al. study from Jordan that the mean ferritin\r\nlevel was 29.5ng/ml (17) whereas Rajwanti K Vaswani et al. in his\r\nstudy group from India found that the mean ferritin level was 31.9\r\nng/ml(24) Similarly Momen Ali Akbar et al. reported a mean\r\nferritin level of 30.3 ng/ml (25).\r\n6. Daoud AS et al. in his study found that a significant proportion of\r\nchildren with febrile seizures had only low serum ferritin level\r\n(17). The proportion of children with febrile seizures having low\r\nhemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Volume and Mean Corpuscular\r\nHemoglobin were not statistically significant. Similarly Momen\r\nAli Akbar et al . also in his study found lower ferritin in a\r\nsignificant proportion of children with febrile seizures without any\r\nsignificant difference in complete blood count indices (25).\r\nWhereas our study demonstrates a statistically significant\r\ndifference in the proportion of children with febrile seizures have\r\nnot only low serum ferritin but also low hemoglobin, low Mean\r\nCorpuscular Volume and low Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin. This\r\nis similar to the findings reported by Naveedur Rehman et al. in his\r\nstudy at Karachi. SUMMARY: 1. The peak incidence of febrile seizures is between one and two\r\nyears of age. The mean age being 23.26 months.\r\n2. A male preponderance is observed in all age groups with male:\r\nfemale ratio of 2:1\r\n3. Family history of febrile seizures is observed in 14% of cases.\r\n4. The mean Serum Ferritin, Hemoglobin and Mean Corpuscular\r\nVolume are significantly lower in children with febrile seizures as\r\ncompared to controls.\r\n5. Significantly, a greater proportion of children with febrile seizures\r\nhave low Serum Ferritin (<12ng/ml); low Hemoglobin (<11gm/dl)\r\nand low Mean Corpuscular Volume (<70fl) as compared to\r\ncontrols. CONCLUSION: Plasma ferritin level and blood indices are significantly lower in\r\nchildren with febrile seizures as compared to children without febrile seizures\r\nsuggesting that iron deficient children are more prone to febrile seizures. A\r\nfollow-up study of patients found to be iron deficient at the time of a first\r\nfebrile seizure to determine the incidence of subsequent febrile seizures after\r\ntreatment for iron deficiency would be of great interest.",

      "abstract": "Hyperarousal has been heavily implicated in sufferers of insomnia, and functional neuroimaging has shown increased cerebral glucose metabolism during both wake and sleep in insomniacs. The activation of extrastriate and limbic structures, combined with a deactivation of primary visual and prefrontal cortices, appears to indicate the existence of a closed processing loop during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Slow waves are prominent characteristics of the later stages of nonrapid eye movement sleep and consist of highamplitude delta waves at 1–4 Hz and a slower oscillatory rhythm of less than 1 Hz. Rapid eye movements are some of the most prominent hallmarks of REM sleep and are believed to be related to the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves identified through cellular recordings in animals. Sleep disturbances are a common facet of depression and include problems in sleep continuity, reductions of slow-wave sleep, decreased REM latency, and increased REM density.",

Only one out of ten patients remains completely free of symptoms within an observational period of 3 to 7 years. The majority of patients suffer long-standing anxiety symptoms which do not significantly interfere with working performance or social relationships. Another ten percent of the patients are continuously impaired in everyday living by severe symptoms. Long duration and severe degree of symptoms at the initial assessment, as well as coexistent depression are associated with a poor outcome. There is evidence of an increased mortality in patients with panic disorder. Suicides are overrepresented among the causes of death. It is not clear whether this is due to the frequent comorbidity between panic disorder, major depression, and substance abuse.",

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

      "abstract": "The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) includes a constellation of symptoms, most prominently excessive daytime somnolence and unrefreshing sleep, associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The periodic respiratory events constituting SDB may be complete cessation of airflow (apneas), reductions in airflow of various degree (hypopneas), increased respiratory \"effort\" events with no increase in airflow (flow limitation events), or a combination of these events occurring at various times during the sleep period. Unrefreshing sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are thought to be because of disruption of the normal sleep architecture from recurrent brief arousals associated with the respiratory events, usually resulting in reduced \"deep\" (slow wave) and rapid eye movement sleep. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation, often severe, usually accompanies the respiratory events and may be a major factor in the cardiovascular morbidity associated with OSAHS. However, this satisfyingly simple and logical construct for OSHAS is likely an oversimplification. The lack of universally accepted criteria for defining a specific disease entity and the lack of certainty about the causal relationship of the various types of respiratory events and associated arousals/desaturations with symptoms and the pathophysiological consequences, limit the understanding of the prevalence, risk factors, and natural history of clinically important SDB.",

In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care. Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing.

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

The headache was diffuse, non-pulsatile and very intense. The duration was variable, from 15 to 45 minutes and usually disappeared without requiring analgesics. The pain was not associated with autonomic or ocular disorders, nausea, vomitting or focal neurological signs. Both general and neurological examinations were completely normal. No alterations were seen on cranial CT. Treatment with lithium was started and there was marked improvement in the frequency of headaches.Hypnic headache is an unusual disorder characterized by episodes of holocranial, or rarely hemicranial, headache of moderate-severe intensity and periodic occurrence. Typically the headache wakes the patient whilst he is asleep ('alarm clock') and there are no autonomic or neurological alterations of any type associated with the episode. The condition usually affects persons over 55 years of age, and it has been related to changes in biological rhythms. This presumed alteration of biological pacemakers has been based on the periodicity of the episodes and the response to lithium.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are prevalent in patients with multiple sclerosis. In contrast, a frank increase of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time is a rare phenomenon, mostly described in the context of REM sleep rebound (after sleep deprivation, abrupt withdrawal of antidepressants or neuroleptics, and during the first night of ventilation for severe sleep apnea), but not in link with specific brain lesions. We incidentally found an isolated, marked increase in REM sleep time (200 min, 40% of total sleep time, normative values: 18.2-20.3%) and in rapid eye movements density during REM sleep in a patient with a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, associated with an anterior pontine demyelinating lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. This result suggests that a network blocking REM sleep in the pons has been damaged.",

      "title": "[Sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias].",
      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients. In my presentation I will cover the most important aspects of the complex relationship between sleep disorders, mental and physical health and quality of life.",

      "title": "1171 Hypersomnia Secondary to Long Covid",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

      "title": "1108 REM Sleep Motor Dysregulation in Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) occurs in up to 90% of narcolepsy patients. REM behavior disorder (RBD), however, is reported to occur in only 12% to 36% of patients with narcolepsy. Use of RSWA has been proposed as an additional marker for narcolepsy diagnosis and as a tool to differentiate between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. We describe a case of narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) with RSWA on polysomnogram (PSG), but no RBD on PSG or by history. A 26 year old female with history of depression, anxiety, and migraine headaches presented with excessive daytime sleepiness requiring daytime naps since childhood. She endorsed sleep paralysis but not hypnagogic hallucinations, dream enactment or cataplexy. Sleep disordered breathing or other abnormalities were absent on overnight PSG. RSWA was seen, however, video recording did not reveal dream enactment behavior. The subsequent multiple sleep latency test showed a mean sleep latency of 3 minutes over 5 naps and 2 sleep onset REM periods. REM related motor findings occur at a higher frequency in patients with narcolepsy than in the general population. Hypocretin deficiency is believed to be the major determinant of REM sleep motor dysregulation observed in narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) are more frequently involved than patients with N-C. RBD associated with narcolepsy differs from idiopathic RBD in that it has equal gender predominance, earlier age at onset, and is associated with less violent and less complex behaviors. Interestingly, RSWA may be absent in RBD with narcolepsy. In addition, RSWA in narcolepsy is frequent even in the absence of RBD. This highlights the need to develop diagnostic criteria for RBD specific to the context of narcolepsy. RSWA is seen in high frequency in narcolepsy and should be strongly considered as a secondary diagnostic criteria.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and obesity: A dangerous triad",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing. It is characterized by recurrent partial or complete obstruction of the upper airways during sleep, which leads to repetitive episodes of reduction (hypopnea) or absence of airflow (apnea) and intermittent hypoxia and arousal.1 The major risk factors for OSA are obesity, male sex, and advanced age.2 The prevalence of OSA is continuously increasing in developed countries in conjunction with the epidemic obesity.3, 4 The present \"gold\" standard for evaluation of sleep and sleep-related breathing is the polysomnography (PSG) with up to 12 recording channels including nasal and oral airflow, respiratory effort transducers, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and oximetry.5 The severity of obstructive sleep apnea is classified based on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)—number of apneic/hypopneic episodes per hour: 5-15, mild; 15-30, moderate; 30 or more, severe.4 The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort study recently reported that the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (ie, AHI ≥ 15 events per hour) was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7-12) among 30- to 49-year-old men; 17% (95% CI: 15-21) among 50- to 70-year-old men; 3% (95% CI: 2-4) among 30- to 49-year-old women; and 9% (95% CI: 7-11) among 50- to 70-year-old women.6 These estimated prevalence rates represent a substantial increase over the last 2 decades (relative increase of 14%-55%, depending on the subgroup). There is overwhelming epidemiologic evidence supporting the causal, bidirectional relationship between OSA and hypertension (HTN). Not only that OSA predisposes patients to HTN development, but also increases an incidence of OSA in hypertensive patients.4, 7, 8 Numerous studies have shown the strong association between OSA and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, large vessel disease, and cerebrovascular disease.4, 9, 10 The main acute changes in OSA are intermittent hypoxia, intrapleural pressure changes, and sleep fragmentation, which together induce endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, and increased oxidative stress.4, 11 Another mechanism, that potentially could contribute to the development of HTN in OSA, is increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).12 Obesity, especially central adiposity, has been recognized as one of the strongest risk factors for OSA for a long time. Due to current pandemic of obesity in the Western countries, the prevalence of OSA is likely to increase.13 In the Sleep Heart Health Study, weight gain of 10 kilograms over a 5-year period conferred a 5.2- and 2.5-fold increase in the likelihood of increasing the AHI by 15 events per hour in men and women, respectively.14 Obesity and OSA tend to coexist and they are associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure (BP), but the causal relation is still not clear.15 While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the main therapy for OSA, its effect on blood pressure (BP) reduction has not been established yet due to the multifactorial nature of HTN.4 Moreover, the impact of CPAP treatment on BP is inconsistent: In minimally symptomatic patients, CPAP has a neutral effect on BP,16 whereas in subjects with resistant hypertension, CPAP can decrease the systolic BP by 5-7 mm Hg.17 Although obesity is a risk factor for OSA and an independent risk factor for HTN, the influence of obesity on BP response to CPAP treatment in adults with OSA is unknown. Moreover, data regarding influence of obesity on BP response to CPAP treatment in adults with OSA are still scarce. In this issue of the Journal, Kuna et al assessed the BP response to CPAP treatment in obese and non-obese adults with OSA.18 This consecutive multicenter study included 188 OSA patients with AHI ≥ 15, which were divided into two groups: obese and non-obese subjects. Additionally, they underwent 24-hour BP monitoring and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine collection at baseline. Obesity was assessed by waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and abdominal visceral fat volume (captured with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Participants adherent to CPAP treatment were reassessed after 4 months. Primary outcomes were 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine level. The results indicate that obesity was not the factor that influenced BP response to treatment of adults with OSA and that BP response to CPAP treatment was not related to baseline 24-hour urinary norepinephrine or change in 24-hour urinary norepinephrine after treatment. Several previous studies reported that change in sympathetic nervous activity, measured by plasma or urinary catecholamine levels, did not correlate with the BP response to CPAP treatment.19-21 Although measurement of urinary catecholamine levels did not detect the effect of sympathetic overactivity on BP in adults with OSA, the authors postulate that it might be possible that measuring muscle sympathetic nerve activity could reveal a significant relationship because sympathetic overactivity has an important role in OSA-related cardiovascular remodeling22 and contributes to a cardiovascular morbidity in these patients23 While the authors found that the participants with OSA had a significant reduction in 24-hour mean arterial pressure following CPAP treatment, there were no significant correlations between the three obesity measures (waist circumference, BMI, and abdominal visceral fat) and change in BP measures. In addition, investigators did not find differences in BP responses comparing obese and non-obese participants. The authors explained negative results by the limited number of subjects in both groups—obese and non-obese patients and suggested that larger studies are necessary. Although the results appear negative, this current study definitely has several important strengths. First, the objective to determine the BP response after CPAP treatment in obese patients was novel. Second, the authors used several parameters for obesity assessment such as waist circumference, body mass index, and abdominal fat volume and not only body mass index, as it is the case with previous studies. Continuous positive airway pressure is recognized as an effective therapy for OSA, but adherence is still suboptimal despite numerous developments in machine dynamics including quieter pumps, softer masks, and improved portability.24 Adherence to CPAP remains relatively low (30%-60%), which continues to be the largest problem with this kind of therapy.25 The main limitation of the present study, which was also claimed by the authors, was a limited sample size that significantly decreased statistical power to less than 80%. The study did not include individuals who were non-adherent to CPAP in order to compare them with those who used CPAP. Additionally, the current investigation involved also normotensive individuals. However, previous studies revealed that patients with higher baseline BP and untreated or resistant HTN had the largest benefit from CPAP therapy.17, 26 It is well known that obesity represents a major risk factor for OSA.2 Surprisingly, there is still a lack of clinical data on the response (eg, BP reduction) to existing therapies such as CPAP in obese and non-obese patients with OSA. The detailed phenotyping and physiological characteristics of obese and non-obese OSA patients and their response to prescribed therapy remain to be clarified in larger, prospective, and randomized studies in the future.

Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation.

      "title": "Consciousness in non‐<scp>REM</scp>‐parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "The unusual aspect of dream consciousness which has been called \"dream bizarreness\" may be defined as impossibility or improbability in the domains of dream plot, cognition and affect. The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to newborns, who spend 16–20 h in sleep each day, adults need only about sleep daily. However, many elderly may struggle to obtain those 8 h in one block. In addition to changes in sleep duration, sleep patterns change as age progresses. Like the physical changes that occur during old age, an alteration in sleep pattern is also a part of the normal ageing process. As people age, they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep. Older people spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep than in deep sleep. As the circadian mechanism in older people becomes less efficient, their sleep schedule is shifted forward. Even when they manage to obtain 7 or 8 h sleep, they wake up early, as they have gone to sleep quite early. The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher among older adults. Loud snoring, which is more common in the elderly, can be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea, which puts a person at risk for cardiovascular diseases, headaches, memory loss, and depression. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder that disrupt sleep are more prevalent in older persons. Other common medical problems of old age such as hypertension diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma, immune disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, physical disability, dementia, pain, depression, and anxiety are all associated with sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Hypersomnia is a group of diseases that share the main symptom - excessive daytime sleepiness, not caused by disturbances in nocturnal sleep or circadian rhythms. Excessive daytime sleepiness is present in 15.6% of adults in the world, a Russian study showed a prevalence of 39.2%. It is associated with a wide range of comorbidities, including obesity and mental disorders, on the other hand, the presence of hypersomnia increases the likelihood of mental illness. People with hypersomnia are more likely to take medications, have a decreased quality of life, spend more health care resources, and more often receive social benefits. The heritability is estimated to be about 40% for sleep duration and 17% for excessive daytime sleepiness. Hypersomnia in mental disorders is secondary. It most often occurs in patients with depression or bipolar disorder. To assess the severity of daytime sleepiness, self-observation and objective methods, including the multiple sleep latency test, actigraphy, polysomnography, are used. In the differential diagnosis of hypersomnia in psychiatric disorders, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis with hypersomnia caused by taking medications or other substances and insufficient sleep syndrome. The etiology of prolonged sleep in psychiatric disorders is complex, and includes biological and psychological causes. The relationship between self-reported hypersomnia and sleep actually obtained is still unclear. Results of daily polysomnography show a significant increase in time in bed during the day and night (clinophilia). Therapy of hypersomniac syndromes should be done taking into account the etiology of the disease. In cases of secondary nature, the main efforts should be directed to the treatment of the underlying mental disorder causing somnolence.Гиперсомнии — это группа заболеваний, которые объединяет основной симптом — чрезмерная дневная сонливость (ЧДС), не обусловленная нарушением ночного сна или циркадианных ритмов. ЧДС присутствует у 15,6% взрослого населения в мире, в российском исследовании показана распространенность 39,2%. Она связана с широким спектром сопутствующих заболеваний, включая ожирение и психические расстройства, с другой стороны, наличие гиперсомнии повышает вероятность развития психических заболеваний. Люди с гиперсомнией чаще принимают лекарственные препараты, имеют сниженное качество жизни, тратят больший ресурс здравоохранения и чаще получают социальные выплаты. Наследуемость оценивается: примерно 40% для продолжительности сна и 17% для чрезмерной дневной сонливости. Гиперсомния при психических расстройствах носит вторичный характер. Наиболее часто она возникает на фоне депрессии и биполярного расстройства. Для оценки выраженности дневной сонливости используют методы самонаблюдения и объективные — множественный тест латентности сна, актиграфию, полисомнографию. При дифференциальной диагностике гиперсомнии при психических расстройствах необходимо проводить дифференциальный диагноз с гиперсомнией, вызванной приемом лекарственных препаратов или других веществ и синдромом недостаточного сна. Этиология длительного сна при психических расстройствах сложна и включает биологические и психологические причины. До сих пор остается неясной связь между самооценкой гиперсомнии и фактически полученным сном. Результаты суточной полисомнографии показывают значительное увеличение времени в постели в течение дня и ночи (клинофилия). Терапию гиперсомнических синдромов необходимо проводить с учетом этиологии заболевания. В случаях вторичного характера основные усилия должны быть направлены на лечение основного психического расстройства, вызывающего сонливость.",

      "title": "Evaluation of pathological sleepiness by M ultiple S leep L atency T est and 24‐hour polysomnography in patients suspected of idiopathic hypersomnia",
      "abstract": "Sleepiness is considered not to be unidimensional. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition (ICSD-3) employs two criteria for 'pathological sleepiness' for idiopathic hypersomnia: (i) sleep prolongation with a 24-h total sleep time (TST) ≥ 660 min, measured either by 24-h polysomnography (24-h PSG) or by wrist-actigraphy-based sleep time averaged for at least 7 days; and high sleep propensity with a mean sleep latency (mSL) of ≤8 min on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).1 The MSLT evaluates the tendency to fall asleep during daytime nap opportunities and serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis of central disorders of hypersomnolence. However, recent studies indicate that the MSLT is inadequate to delineate hypersomnia other than narcolepsy type 1.2-4 Although several attempts using continuous PSG monitoring have been performed,5-7 appropriate markers for idiopathic hypersomnia have not been established.8 We performed 24-h PSG, standard PSG, and MSLT to understand the difference between the two aspects of sleepiness. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Institute of Neuropsychiatry and Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. All patients gave written informed consent. Forty consecutive patients visiting Seiwa Hospital with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time were evaluated by 3-day sleep studies – unattended 24-h PSG, followed by PSG and MSLT – from January 2017 to June 2019. Clinical and PSG variables from 35 eligible patients were compared to search for markers of pathological sleepiness. Our patients turned out to share clinical symptoms characteristic of idiopathic hypersomnia. (Detailed methods and characteristics of our patients are provided in Supplementary Information, Table S1.) Twenty-nine of 35 patients were confirmed to have pathological sleepiness as determined either with 24-h PSG TST ≥ 660 min (27 patients) or MSLT mSL ≤ 8 min (six patients). Only four patients met both criteria, indicating that pathological sleepiness determined with 24-h PSG and MSLT reflected different aspects of sleepiness (see Supplementary Fig. S1). We next searched for markers characteristic of patients with sleep prolongation or high sleep propensity. There were no differences in demographic data, self-reported measures, or clinical symptoms except for higher percentage of 'always unrefreshed nap' in those with sleep prolongation and higher percentage of 'experience of sleep attack' and lower percentage of 'long nap' in those with high sleep propensity (Table S1). As expected, we confirmed shorter MSLT mSL in the high-sleep-propensity group and longer 24-h PSG TST in the sleep-prolongation group (Table 1). No conventional PSG variables predicted sleep prolongation. Some sleep variables on 24-h PSG were identified as possible markers for sleep prolongation: shortened REM latency (P = 0.026), lower 24-h PSG_N3 (%TST; P = 0.020), more non rapid eye movement (NREM)-REM cycle counts (P = 0.0002), and shorter NREM-REM cycle duration (P = 0.046). Binary logistic regression analyses confirmed that a symptom of 'always unrefreshed upon waking' (odds ratio [OR] 44.1, P = 0.021), 24-h PSG REM latency (OR 1.009, P = 0.027), and 24-h PSG NREM-REM cycle duration (OR 1.07, P = 0.06) were independent predictors of pathological sleep prolongation. Similar analyses revealed that a symptom of 'experience of sleep attack' was independently associated with high sleep propensity (OR 0.11, P = 0.023). (See Table S2. Detailed description for Table 1 and S2 are provided in Supplementary Information.) Twenty-five of the 35 patients fulfilled the ICSD-3 criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia, two with narcolepsy type 2, two with pathological sleepiness without a diagnosis (sleep prolongation with multiple sleep-onset REM periods [SOREMP]), and six with non-hypersomnia. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of two tests for the diagnosis of ICSD-3-defined idiopathic hypersomnia were calculated. Test sensitivity was 12% with MSLT and 92% with 24-h PSG, test specificity was 80% and 60%, and accuracy was 34% and 83%, respectively (Table S3). The low sensitivity and accuracy of MSLT may be partly due to the sampling bias because we performed 24-h PSG only for those with habitually long self-reported sleep time. However, our results indicated that 79% (23/29) of our patients with pathological sleepiness would be overlooked if they were evaluated with MSLT alone, replicating that idiopathic hypersomnia patients often fail to show high sleep propensity.1, 6, 9, 10 Although the presence of multiple SOREMP reflects the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, there is no evidence that their absence is related to the pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia. In this study, four of 27 (14.8%) patients with pathological sleep prolongation showed multiple SOREMP on MSLT. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to clarify the significance of SOREMP and other REM abnormalities in those with sleep prolongation. (REM abnormality and limitations of this study are described in detail in Supplementary Information.) Our study indicates that the two aspects of sleepiness, sleep prolongation and high sleep propensity, are fundamentally different, and that 24-h PSG should be used as a first-line diagnostic tool for idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time. We would like to thank all the patients who participated in this study. We would also like to thank the nursing staff at Seiwa Hospital for handling blood samples and Ms Megumi Hazumi for obtaining informed consent.

The bottom line in the position sensor (U) indicates that the participant was in the upright position. Table S1. Clinical characteristics of patients. Demographic data, self-reported measures, HLA-DQB1 status, and frequency of clinical symptoms related to idiopathic hypersomnia are listed. A higher percentage of those with sleep prolongation experienced a symptom of 'always unrefreshed upon waking (unrefreshed nap),' and a higher percentage of those with high sleep propensity had experience of a symptom of 'sleep attack.' Table S2. Logistic regression models. Table S2A: Logistic regression model for sleep prolongation. Binary logistic regression using a backward elimination approach was performed to identify predictors of sleep prolongation. The initial model included age, sex, BMI, and candidate variables identified in the bivariate analyses. Those with 'always unrefreshed upon waking from naps' had a 44-fold higher risk for pathological sleep prolongation. This final model had good Nagelkerke's R square value. Table S2B: Logistic regression model for high sleep propensity. Similar logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of high sleep propensity. The initial model included age, sex, BMI, and two symptoms: long nap >30min and the experience of sleep attack. Those with the experience of sleep attack had a 0.104-fold lower risk (that is, a 9.6-fold higher risk) for high sleep propensity. Only sleep attack remained in the final model with low Nagelkerke's R square value. Table S3. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and 24-h polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. The results of total sleep time (TST) on 24-h PSG and mean sleep latency (mSL) on MSLT, a marker for pathological sleepiness, were tabulated against the final diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition (ICSD-3) criteria. Test sensitivity and accuracy were higher with 24-h PSG, indicating that 24-h PSG was a better diagnostic tool for our patients, who were suspected of idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time.

The derangement of one or more of the physiological processes can result in a number of sleep disturbances such as insomnia, sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy, and parasomnias. Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in individuals experiencing sleep disturbances. The general view of sleep regulation is that two main processes are integrated to control the amount and timing of sleep. Given the heterogenous state of the sleep/wake cycle, supplying an answer to the simple question as to why an organism sleeps is very complex, and several theories have been proposed. Several studies have evaluated the sleep-inducing and sleep-promoting effects of various H3 receptor agonists.

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

Forty-three adult DM1 patients underwent 2 sequential polysomnographic sessions and a neuropsychological test battery (intellectual functioning, attention, language, memory, and executive functions). Lower scores in attention, vigilance, and executive functioning tests were associated with higher number of apneic/hypopneic episodes per hour of sleep and longer total sleep time at an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 90%. Results suggest a potential role for nighttime breathing problems in the cognitive impairment often observed in DM1 patients.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders, it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g. psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are both common and consequential, but too often remain undiagnosed. The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Severe sleep inertia (SI) can often be managed with behavioral modifications and stimulants. This patient’s sleep inertia was resistant to such therapies but had remarkable improvement with Bupropion. Report of case(s) An 11-year-old male with a history of seizures presented with hypersomnolence, SI and difficulty arousing in the morning for 3 years. There was no reported cataplexy, with occasional hypnogogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Family denied witnessed apneas or snoring. He had previously undergone an adenotonsillectomy at 6 years of age for obstructive sleep apnea. When initially seen, he was not taking antiseizure medications, Epworth score was 14 and BMI was 30.5 kg/m2. Polysomnogram showed an AHI of 1.5 events/hour with REM latency of 179.5 minutes. Multiple sleep latency testing showed a mean sleep latency of 4 minutes, 7 seconds with 3 SOREM periods: consistent with narcolepsy. Melatonin and methylphenidate were initially prescribed, followed by dextroamphetamine-amphetamine, but were discontinued due to worsening hypersomnolence. Armodafinil improved his overall daytime sleepiness, however, severe SI persisted intermittently in the morning and with naps to the point of EMS being called on multiple occasions. EEG and brain-MRI were normal. For suspected cataplexy, venlafaxine was tried and not beneficial. Calcium-magnesium-potassium and sodium oxybate (XW) lead to no improvement in his SI. Therefore, Methylphenidate-20mg (MP) and then Armodafinil-50mg were added before bedtime, however, his SI persisted with frequently missed school. Bedtime Bupropion 150 mg was added with an immediate response. He has not missed school or daytime activities with Bupropion. Conclusion Sleep inertia is typically a characteristic of idiopathic hypersomnia rather than narcolepsy and is related to the abnormal transition of sleep to wakefulness resulting in reduced alertness, impaired performance, and desire to return to sleep. Such pronounced sleep inertia is atypical and caused significant quality of life impairment in our patient. Nighttime melatonin, XW, MP, and bupropion for SI has been described in the literature1. Our patient failed multiple treatments before bupropion which was immediately successful. Support (if any) 1. Treatment of severe morning sleep inertia with bedtime long-acting bupropion and/or long-acting methylphenidate in a series of 4 patients. Schenck, MD1 ; Golden, MD2 ; Millman, MD3",

      "abstract": "Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an uncommon clinical syndrome characterized by short‐term memory loss and disorientation that resolves in 24 h. Here, we report a 60‐year‐old male patient who presented with a sudden onset of disorientation and short‐term memory loss and started to ask about his whereabouts and what happened. He had no significant past medical or psychiatric disorder. Likewise, the patient did not have a recent history of head trauma, substance abuse, loss of consciousness, seizure disorder, or migraine. Neurologic examination was normal except for mild disorientation and short‐term memory impairment. He had a score of 18/30 on the mini‐mental state examination. Extensive laboratory investigations did not show any abnormal findings. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. His memory improved and returned to a normal baseline within 24 h from the onset. After the exclusion of potential causes and the patient returned to a normal state of memory, the diagnosis of transient global amnesia was made. At the follow‐up visit, the patient was in a state of normal function without a recurrence of memory impairment. Here, we presented this interesting case of transient global amnesia. TGA is a diagnosis of exclusion and is essential to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with acute onset of short‐term memory impairment, especially when etiological investigations reveal no potential cause.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is commonly defined as a state in which physical activities and sensory perception are greatly reduced, and it is frequently associated with our body's recuperative period. However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu.

      "abstract": "Thirty-five EEG patterns of grand mal seizures recorded under some conditions such as awake-rest, sleep activation, beme-gride activation and intermittent photic stimulation were studied in 31 epileptics and four non-epileptics. Preictal EEG's were generally variable in comparison with ictal EEG's. It was not till 10 sec before seizures that the incidence of seizure discharges changed in most all cases, of which six increased and four decreased. A paroxysmal extreme varied EEG abnormality often continued for several to several ten sec immediately before a tonic phase, associated with some clinical symptoms. EEG patterns of the “preconvulsive phase” were divided into six types with different clinical features. In most all cases of bamegride activation, poly-spike and wave discharges preceded on seizure activities and some of them related with absence or psychomotor epilepsies. In all cases of sleep activation and photic stimulation, high voltage slow bursts or poly spikes preceded. Seizure patterns recorded at awake-rest were indefinite. A few cases didn't show any preconvulsive EEG changes, and were closely related with grand mal epilepsies. While the grand mal seizure during sleep had a long tonic-clonic convulsive phase and a short pre- and postconvulsive phase, that induced by bemegride activation showed the opposite findings. The grand mal seizure at awake-rest had the middle tendency between the two. The differences among the effects of various recording conditions on seizure patterns present some suggestions as to the patho-physiological mechanism of epileptic seizures.",

Hypersomnia reduces the quality of life, complicates socialization, can provoke insomnia, impulsive behaviour, and even depression or suicidal tendencies. The causes of increased daytime sleepiness may be non-compliance with sleep hygiene, nighttime sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, etc.). If these conditions are excluded, you need to pay attention to rare forms of sleep pathology included in the group of central hypersomnia. Aim of the review: to determine the prevalence, pathogenesis, clinic, diagnosis, and treatment of hypersomnia in children. Among the central hypersomnia, narcolepsy is more common than the rest in the population. Idiopathic hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more rare forms of pathology. The pathogenesis of central hypersomnia has not yet been sufficiently studied, disorders of the immune system are of key importance, but there may be other causes. The leading clinical manifestation is daytime sleepiness, which worsens the child’s quality of life. In the diagnosis of hypersomnia, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MTLS) are of key importance, in some cases other diagnostic methods (MRI) should be used. Pharmacotherapy relieves the condition in sick children, but does not completely eliminate the symptoms. New medicines are being developed. Treatment of hypertension should be comprehensive, not limited to drug therapy.",

Almost 50% of all cases of chronic insomnia are due to a mental disorder, with depressive illness explaining the majority of cases related to mental disorder (Slide 1). Other common causes of comorbid, or secondary, insomnia include chronic respiratory disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pain, degenerative neurological disease, and some medications such as glucocorticoids and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A general principle of management of insomnia related to mental or medical disorders is that the principal disorder must be fully treated as part of the insomnia treatment plan.

Treatment options include sodium oxybate the sodium salt of γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Oxybate, an endogenous metabolite of GABA, acts through GABAB noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons. &amp;lt; 1% may experience suicidal ideations or psychosis. Report of case(s) A 17-year-old female with obesity, spina bifida occulta follows with sleep for idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep (TST 12.6 hours on polysomnography) and a delayed circadian rhythm. Her typical sleep zone is 11:00PM to 10:00AM, but she can easily sleep until 2:00PM. She started sodium oxybate to minimize her sleep burden and improve daytime wakefulness. She initially developed insomnia with concern for mania and migraines with photophobia and phonophobia. After 26 days, oxybate was discontinued. Her migraines persisted daily. Her sleep schedule and mood returned to baseline within 17 days thereafter. A 48-year-old female with anxiety/depression, PTSD has follows with sleep since age 42 for unspecified hypersomnia, either narcolepsy type 1 with long sleep versus idiopathic hypersomnia. Initial polysomnography/MSLT on fluoxetine revealed AHI 1.6, with a mean sleep latency of 6.4 minutes without SOREMPs. Her typical sleep zone was 8:00PM to 9:00AM. She was started on sodium oxybate for her cataplexy and daytime sleepiness. She had remarkable improvement in her symptoms after 4 days. After 35 days on 9 grams nightly she developed anxiety, extracorporeal sensations, and paranoia. The dose was decreased to 7.5 grams nightly. By 7 months of therapy her paranoia progressed to the point where she threatened her landlord and was facing legal consequences. Sodium oxybate was discontinued. At 53-years-old she was trial on mixed-salts oxybate. After three months of therapy, she became hypomanic with severe pressured speech despite a euthymic mood. She reported going without sleep entirely for 3-4 days at a time using this oxybate. Mixed-salts oxybate was discontinued and 36 days later with in addition to quetiapine, her hypomania was nearly resolved and she was able to get 8-9 hours of restful sleep. Conclusion Hypomania appears to be a rare but serious side effect of oxybate in long-sleepers. Discontinuing oxybate may not be sufficient therapy. Support (if any)",

Sleep latency was significantly longer in the depressive groups. The nonendogenous depressive patients exhibited significantly more awake time and lower sleep efficiency during the sleep period. No significant group differences were found for first rapid eye movement (REM) period latency, REM density, or any other REM sleep measures. Age correlated significantly with REM latency and delta sleep time, especially among depressive patients. No significant correlations between sleep measures and severity of illness were found. It appears that the classic REM sleep findings associated with the adult depressive syndrome are not present among depressive adolescents, indicating a later ontogeny for these abnormalities.",

      "title": "Insomnia treatment for adolescents: Effectiveness of group- and Internet therapy for sleep, psychopathology, cognitive functioning and societal costs",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is worldwide the most common sleep disorder among adolescents with estimates of a point prevalence ranging from 7.8% up to 23.8%. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep, for at least 3 days per week, accompanied by significant daytime impairment, for at least 3 months, despite adequate opportunity to sleep. It tends to persist over time with high chronicity. Insomnia has a bidirectional relationship with psychopathology, suggesting that it can cause or exacerbate other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even ADHD. Studies show that adolescents with disturbed sleep report more depression and anxiety, inattention and conduct problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and impaired academic performance. Furthermore, adolescents with sleep disturbances report worse perceived health, more sleepiness, energy loss, and daytime fatigue. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) is the first choice for treatments of adults, but CBTI has not been investigated in a randomized controlled trial in adolescents. Furthermore, adolescents are reluctant to seek help for psychological problems, and availability of CBTI falls short of the demand. Internet therapy has been shown to be feasible in adolescents, and therefore CBTI delivered through the Internet could fill the gap between demand and availability of insomnia treatment. In this dissertation a tailored CBTI protocol for adolescents called Slim Slapen (Sleeping Smart), was investigated for efficacy of group- and Internet therapy compared to a waiting list condition, for sleep, psychopathology, cognitive functioning, and cost-effectiveness.",

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital function to all species for reinvigorating the mental and physical senses. During sleep, specific synapses become less active to eliminate unneeded memories as other synapses strengthen to enhance memory consolidation. Healthy quality and longevity of sleep can also regulate moods by ridding fatigue and repairing integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connections. External disturbances affect the quality of sleep, and an individual's routine may play a role in the development of sleeping disorders. By irregulating the circadian rhythm and having consistent negative sleeping habits, sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea may develop. Eight to nine hours of sleep are recommended to both teenagers and adults, if less is received, difficulty in concentration and interpretation of information may be present, as well as physiological effects such as higher blood pressure caused by the disrupted regulation of stress hormones, which if continued, can make the body more prone to serious health conditions.The science of sleep and dreaming comprises a relevant thesis in modern neuroscience research and issues major comprehensions on the study of human consciousness. Dreams are an integral part of sleep. Sleep and dream cycles vary in phenomenology, characteristics, and under circumstances, interpretation of the individual. Various theories such as Sigmun Freud's Psychodynamic theory, the activation synthesis model, and the cognitive development theory have been created and numerous studies are ongoing as the principal motive of dreams has not yet been concluded. Some theories remain heavily physiological as high difficulty of investigations are discontinued by scientists and deemed unverifiable. The research presented here revolves around the neurology of sleep as to inquire into the physiology and investigations on the purpose of dreams. We thus conclude the current review with a call for further research directed towards the primary purpose of sleep and dream.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder that describes repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to increased work of breathing, blood gas derangements, intrathoracic pressure swings, autonomic imbalances, and fragmented sleep.Even though the body is undergoing many physiologic disturbances (measured in exquisite detail over many hours), we continue to define the disease by one metric-the apneahypopnea index, or AHI.The AHI quantifies the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, regardless of associated hypoxemia, hypercarbia, arousals, hemodynamic changes, etc.An AHI ≥ 5 events/h diagnoses OSA, and an AHI ≥ 30 events/h arguably arbitrarily defines \"severe OSA\".However, as anyone who reads sleep studies appreciates, not all apneas or hypopneas are the same (between individuals or even within an single night; Figure 1).By distilling OSA into this single metric, we disregard other potentially impactful disease characteristics, such as event duration, hypoxemia burden, arousal intensity, heart rate variability, sleep stage, or body position dependence.][5] Several studies have attempted to identify polysomnographic traits that may better predict cardiovascular disease.For example, Oldenburg et al 6 showed the amount of total sleep time with SpO 2 < 90% (TST90) better predicted all-cause mortality in OSA patients with heart failure even after adjustment for confounding factors.In their study, the risk of death increased by 16% for every hour of TST90.Azarbarzin et al 7 computed a measurement of \"hypoxic burden\" by measuring the area under the oxygen desaturation curve during an obstructive event.They found that hypoxic burden from OSA was better than AHI at predicting cardiovascular endpoints.Butler et al 8 found that shorter duration of obstructive events predicted allcause mortality over and beyond that predicted by the AHI.Event duration is a heritable trait reflecting arousability.Those who tend to have shorter obstructive events may be prone to greater sleep fragmentation and sympathetic activity, which are detrimental to cardiovascular health.Finally, data is amassing to suggest that the pathogenesis and sequelae of OSA are sleep-stage dependent.Obstructive events during",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral part of depressive disorder. As such, they are a part of all contemporary sets of diagnostic criteria for major depression and of all major symptom-based rating scales for depression. Insomnia is a particularly frequent complaint, and it is reported by more than 90% of depressed patients. Although the \"kindling\" or \"illness transduction\" model of depression remains hypothetical, there is evidence that people with recurrent depression have more pronounced abnormalities of sleep neurophysiology than those experiencing a single or initial episode. Therefore, early relief of insomnia in a depressed patient, in addition to alleviating other symptoms, may increase adherence to treatment and increase daytime performance and overall functioning, while complete relief of insomnia may improve prognosis. Stimulation of serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors is thought to underlie insomnia and changes in sleep architecture seen with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This is the reason why hypnotics or low-dose trazodone are commonly coprescribed at the initiation of the treatment with either the SSRIs or SNRIs. On the other hand, antidepressant drugs with 5-HT2 blocking properties, such as mirtazapine or nefazodone, alleviate insomnia and improve sleep architecture. In depressed patients, mirtazapine produces a significant shortening of sleep-onset latency, increases a total sleep time, and leads to a marked improvement in sleep efficiency. Antidepressants with preferential 5-HT2 blocking properties are therefore a good treatment option for depressed patients with marked insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia, waking up at night to urinate, is a highly prevalent disorder in the elderly with a profound impact on life expectancy, health and quality of life. It interacts negatively with sleep and is associated with increased daytime sleepiness. In particular, waking up three or more times a night to void is related to a steep increase in sleep disturbances. Giddiness, both at night and during the day, is another common consequence, since in three out of four cases, nocturia can be attributed to nocturnal urine overproduction, causing a negative fluid balance. Fall injuries are the most important risk associated with nocturia. Nocturia may be attributable not only to nocturnal polyuria, but also to a diminished nocturnal bladder capacity, or both. Treatment may include diuretics (taken in the afternoon instead of in the morning), vasopressin analogs (desmopressin) at bedtime or antimuscarinic drugs to improve nocturnal bladder capacity.",

We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73‐year‐old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep–wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities.

      "abstract": "Sleep medicine is relevant in both neurology and general medicine. A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness.

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours.

The literature supports the etiology as “high loop gain/increased controller gain,” along with central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with common diagnoses (e.g. heart failure). Available data place the adult population prevalence at about 0.05% (men) and 0.003% (women), while up to 11% of patients diagnosed with CSA may be classified as ICSA. Symptoms may include nocturnal choking, witnessed apneas, awakenings with the sensation of shortness of breath, restless sleep, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and variable degrees of snoring. Per the ICSD-3, ICSA may only be diagnosed if “The disorder [CSA] is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.” However, a putative diagnosis of ICSA should prompt a comprehensive search for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, ischemic central nervous system pathology, acromegaly, and licit or illicit respiratory depressant drug use, which could be a potential cause of CSA. Systematic studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach. However, if present, ICSA is excluded and intervention can be initiated for the underlying diagnosis, which may resolve CSA and, importantly, improve outcomes specific to the causative disease. Treatment options for ICSA include devices such as adaptive servo-ventilation or transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, medications such as acetazolamide, and sleep position training.",

      "title": "Reconsidering sleep perception in insomnia: from misperception to mismeasurement",
      "abstract": "Summary So‐called ‘sleep misperception’ refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective–objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture ‘wake‐like’ brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro‐ and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non‐rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought‐like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.",

      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism.

      "title": "Clinical Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be \"things that go bump in the night\", or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases is due to an exaggerated reduction in lung volumes during supine sleep, a compromised physiologic adaptation to sleep, and specific features of the diseases that may promote upper airway collapse or heart failure. The normal decrease in the rib cage contribution to the tidal volume during phasic REM sleep becomes a critical vulnerability, resulting in saw-tooth oxygen desaturation possibly representing the earliest manifestation of respiratory muscle weakness. Hypoventilation can occur in REM sleep and progress into non-REM sleep, with continuous desaturation and hypercarbia. Specific characteristics of neuromuscular disorders, such as pharyngeal neuropathy or weakness, macroglossia, bulbar manifestations, or low lung volumes, predispose patients to the development of obstructive events. Central sleep-disordered breathing can occur with associated cardiomyopathy (e.g., dystrophies) or from instability in the control of breathing due to diaphragm weakness. Mitigating factors such as recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles, reduction in REM sleep, and loss of normal REM atonia in some individuals may partially protect against sleep-disordered breathing. Noninvasive ventilation, a standard-of-care management option for sleep-disordered breathing, can itself trigger specific sleep-disordered breathing events including air leaks, patient-ventilator asynchrony, central sleep apnea, and glottic closure. These events increase arousals, reduce adherence, and impair sleep architecture. Polysomnography plays an important role in addressing pitfalls in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases, identifying sleep-disordered breathing triggered by noninvasive ventilation, and optimizing noninvasive ventilation settings.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is prevalent, causing severe distress and impairment. This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

The nervous patient sleeps badly, but the nature of the insomnia varies in many ways. Some go to sleep the moment they lie down, only to awake an hour or two later, to toss throughout the night, and possibly to doze off at the hour when they should awake. Others sleep well till the first peep of day, rising ill-humored and cross, having lost two of their nine hours' sleep. Some patients apparently never sleep and remain calm and comfortable the entire night, get very restless and provoked, get up and walk around",

S disturbances have been shown to increase risk and/or exacerbate psychiatric and physical health problems in many different populations. However, few studies have examined the relationships among sleep, psychiatric, and cognitive functioning in Veterans with TBI.\r\nMethods: Retrospective chart reviews of 137 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI referred for cognitive rehabilitation at the Veteran Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.\r\nResults: 100% of Veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory [PSQI] global scores >5). Veterans also reported clinically relevant impairments in sleep latency (50 minutes), total sleep time (5.5 hours), and sleep efficiency (77%). More severe sleep problems were related to greater endorsement of depressive, post-concussive, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Conversely, sleep disturbance showed limited associations with objective neuropsychological assessment. Overall measures of affective functioning were significantly associated with global measures of sleep quality, though such relationships were not observed for quantitative measures of sleep.\r\nConclusions: Veterans with mild to moderate TBI exhibit very high rates of sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is associated with higher levels of comorbid psychiatric symptomatology, particularly affective complaints. The high prevalence of sleep problems in Veterans with a history of TBI underscores a need to develop both a better understanding of etiologic mechanisms relating brain injury and sleep and a better clinical appreciation of the ramifications of sleep disturbance on daily functioning and recovery in individuals who experience TBI.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder (SRRMD) is characterized by repetitive rhythmic motor behaviors involving large muscle groups that occur predominantly during stage N1 sleep. SSRMs are common in infants and children but they usually spontaneously resolve before adolescence. This case presents a rare adult case of SRRMD. Report of case(s) A 60-year-old man initially presents to clinic for evaluation of repetitive movements needed to initiate sleep. Patient reports the problem starting in his childhood, where he needs to rock and roll intentionally in bed to fall asleep. He had been prescribed clonazepam 2mg and had been taking this along with doxylamine and melatonin nightly, but still reports frequent nocturnal awakenings due to body rolling. He specifically denies any hypnic kicking/jerking, or discomfort in legs while falling asleep. Patient has no excessive alcohol consumption, marijuana, or illicit drug use. Differentials for the patient’s condition include hyperarousal, chronic anxiety, iron deficiency, sleep-related breathing disorder, and rhythmic movement disorder. Patient consequently underwent an in-lab diagnostic polysomnography study which showed no evidence of sleep-related breathing disorders with AHI of 1.6 (AASM 3%). Sleep efficiency was low at 60.8% and sleep architecture showed decreased REM sleep and decreased N3 sleep. Rhythmic movements were noted during sleep and it was manifested by excessive transient muscle activity in both limb &amp; chin EMG leads and also whole body rocking in the video recording. Moderate periodic limb movements were noted with PLM index to 17. Patient was seen in clinic 6 months later with persistent symptoms and his dose of clonazepam was increased slowly to 2.5 mg and then 3 mg. On the 3 mg of clonazepam, patient had resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Our case describes a patient who had SRRMs that commenced in childhood persisting well into adulthood. Reported adult cases of SRRMD are few, and have been associated with sleep apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder, and RLS, while many remain idiopathic such as the case with this patient. While benzodiazepines are still first line for SRRMD, further work up and investigation into possible comorbid conditions could yield insight into the etiology and offer alternative treatment options to patients.

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

Fatigue, when present in those with nasal problems and otherwise unexplained, is often considered secondary to poor or inadequate sleep.‘,’ Nasal obstruction itself is associated with many systemic reflexes, including changes in intrathoracic pressure, pulse, and blood pressure.3 Reports during the 19th century proposed a nasal reflex rather than sleep disturbance as the origin of fatigue in many patients with nasal obstruction. The following case describes fatigue associated with nasal obstruction promptly relieved by a nasal dilator and therefore unrelated to sleep abnormalities. The patient was a 4%year-old man with a lo-year history of unexplained persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest. The fatigue was especially pronounced on awakening but continued throughout the day. It was not associated with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, headache, or known sleep disturbance. Aside from fatigue, symptoms were limited to nasal congestion especially on the left side and a “heavy-headedness” sensation in the head. Four comprehensive examinations over the 10 symptomatic years were without relevant findings. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a cyst in the left maxillary sinus noted on a sinus roentgenogram prompted the following procedures: creation of antral windows, removal of the maxillary cyst, nasal septum reconstruction, and partial resection of the inferior turbinates; all with no effect on the fatigue. Approximately 8 years after the onset of fatigue, the patient noted that relief could be obtained by pressing up the left external nares. This observation suggested dysfunction of the nasal valve and prompted reconstruction using cartilage grafts, a procedure that was unsuccessful in relieving his inadequate air flow or his fatigue. At the suggestion of a consultant he purchased a nasal dilator for the left anterior nares and obtained almost immediate relief of the fatigue. Fatigue consistently returned within 15 minutes if the dilator was removed and promptly resolved when reinserted, indicating the lack of any association with sleep. Systemic reactions to nasal disease are well documented in the medical literature but fatigue, when associated with nasal obstruction, is generally considered secondary to sleep abnormalities. Before the clear association of nasal obstruction and sleep abnormalities was known, reports in the older literature postulated a “nasal reflex” to explain the resolution of fatigue and a number of other significant complaints after nasal surgery or cauterization. In 1898, Wells reported cases of neurological and mental manifestations of nasal disease associated with extraordinary fatigue.* At the time of the linkage of nasal symptoms with fatigue and inability to concentrate was well accepted enough to generate the term “aprosexia nasalis.” More recent research documents profound changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, nasal stimulation is associated with vasoconstruction, laryngeal construction, and bronchoconstriction. Cottle maintained that air currents stimulating the nasal mucosa effect remote organs by nerve pathways and may be responsible for a state of ill health. Nasal valve movements, he also noted, were largely responsible for the “rest” obtained by the body during sleeps5 This case report suggests that unilateral nasal obstruction may be responsible for fatigue independent of any effect it might have on sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for human survival since it helps to restore and maintain our bodies' immune systems and other essential processes. One-third of a person's life is devoted to sleeping, although few are aware of the many positive aspects of this activity. Two distinct types of sleep, REM and NREM, have been identified. A good night's rest is achieved when REM and NREM sleep alternate in a regular pattern. Disruptions to this cycle, whether they originate physiologically or psychologically, have been linked to a variety of health problems. Polysomnography (PSG) equipment is often used in sleep labs inside hospitals to perform sleep studies. A polysomnogram is an in-depth medical technique that records a patient's vital signs while they sleep and necessitates a hospital stay. Clinically, sleep apnea is defined as a breathing disease in which there are periodic pauses in breathing lasting 10 seconds or more that occur more than five times during the night. Sleep apnea may be classified as either Obstructive, Central, or Mixed. The prevalent sleep problem known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by the relaxation of muscles in the upper airway during sleep. The purpose of this study is to provide a technique for screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea by analysing Heart Rate Variability of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data while the subject is asleep. The goals of this study are to create computational approaches for identifying OSA based on characteristics extracted from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals derived from sleep electrocardiograms (ECGs). Physio Net's Apnea-ECG recordings serve as the source for the ECG data.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described.

This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

      "title": "Low Iron Status: A Possible Risk Factor for First Febrile Seizure",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SEIZURES IN CHILDHOOD: A seizure or convulsion is a paroxysmal, time-limited change in motor activity and/or\r\nbehavior that result from abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures are common in the\r\npediatric age group and occur in approximately 10% of children. Most seizures in children are\r\nprovoked by somatic disorders originating outside the brain, such as high fever, infection,\r\nsyncope, head-trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac arrhythmias. Other events, such as breathholding\r\nspells and gastro esophageal reflux, can cause events that simulate seizures. A few\r\nchildren also exhibit psychogenic seizures of psychiatric origin. Less than one third of seizures\r\nin children are caused by epilepsy, a condition in which seizures are triggered recurrently from\r\nwithin the brain.\r\nFor epidemiological classification purposes, epilepsy is considered to be present when\r\ntwo or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval greater than 24 hr apart. The cumulative\r\nlifetime incidence of epilepsy is 3% and more than half of cases begin in childhood. However,\r\nthe annual prevalence of epilepsy is lower (10.5—0.8%) because many children outgrow\r\nepilepsy.\r\nAlthough the outlook for most children with symptomatic seizures or those associated\r\nwith epilepsy is generally good, the seizures may signal a potentially serious underlying\r\nsystemic or central nervous system (CNS) disorder that requires thorough investigation and\r\nmanagement. For children with epilepsy, the prognosis is generally good, but 10—20% have persistent seizures refractory to drugs, and those cases pose a diagnostic and management\r\nchallenge.\r\nSeizures have been recognized since ancient times and although improvement has been\r\nmade in management over this century compared to the previous 2000 years, there are still far\r\ntoo many children whose lives are crippled by poorly controlled seizures. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the association between iron deficiency and the first febrile seizure. DISCUSSION: In our study to detect low iron status as a possible risk factor for first febrile seizures 63\r\ncases and 63 age and sex matched controls are studied and analyzed .\r\nIn the present study we found that the peak incidence of febrile seizure occur during one to\r\ntwo years of age and the mean age is 18 months. This is comparable to previous studies. The\r\npeak age of onset being 14-18 months of age as per Nelson textbook of pediatrics (22). Berg et\r\nal. in his study found that the peak incidence is between 18 and 24 months (12). Similarly\r\nNaveedur Rehman et al. reported the peak incidence at 22 Months (18).\r\nThe present study depicts that the incidence of febrile seizures is slightly higher in boys\r\nthan in girls and the male: female ratio 1.4: 1. This is similar to the study by Berg et al (12).\r\nwhile Naveedur Rehman et al. reported no gender difference in their study (18).\r\nIn our study family history of febrile seizures is seen only in 28.5% of cases. But Forfar\r\ntextbook of pediatrics mentions that 50% will have a family history of convulsions and\r\n80% of monozygotic twins are concordant for febrile convulsions (23).\r\nThe mean serum ferritin level in our study is 14.5ng/ml. whereas Daoud As et al. in his\r\nstudy group from Jordan found that the mean ferritin level was 29.5ng/ml (17). It is\r\nprobably due to the fact that iron deficiency anemia is more prevalent in our country; the\r\nmean serum ferritin level of Indian children is also low when compared to the Western\r\nstandards. CONCLUSION: Plasma ferritin level and blood indices are significantly lower in children with febrile\r\nseizures as compared to children without febrile seizures suggesting that iron deficient children\r\nare more prone to febrile seizures. A follow-up study of patients found to be iron deficient at\r\nthe time of a first febrile seizure to determine the incidence of subsequent febrile seizures after\r\ntreatment for iron deficiency would be of great interest.\r\n· Daoud As et al. in his study found that a significant proportion of children with febrile\r\nseizures had only low serum ferritin level (17). The proportion of children with febrile\r\nseizures having low hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Volume and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin were not statistically significant. Whereas our study demonstrates a\r\nstatistically significant difference in the proportion of children with febrile seizures have not\r\nonly low serum ferritin but also low hemoglobin and low Mean Corpuscular Volume. This\r\nis similar to the findings reported by Naveedur Rehman et al. in his study at Karachi (18).\r\nThis is probably due to the fact that iron deficiency occurs in three stages.\r\n(a) First stage characterized by decreased storage of iron without any other detectable\r\nabnormalities.\r\n(b) An intermediate stage of `latent iron deficiency` i.e. iron stores are exhausted, but\r\nanemia has not occurred yet.\r\n(c) The third stage is that of overt iron deficiency when there is a decrease in the\r\nconcentration of circulating hemoglobin due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis.\r\nThe children in Western countries if they are iron deficient are mostly in the early stage.\r\nSo the study done by Daoud AS et al. in Jordan has a significant proportion of children with\r\nlow ferritin level, without significant difference in HB, MCV and MCH. Whereas Indian\r\nchildren/children of our neighboring country Pakistan are in the stages of latent or overt iron\r\ndeficiency. So our study and the study done in Karachi by Naveedur Rehman et al. had a\r\nsignificantly greater proportion of children with not only low serum ferritin but also low HB\r\nand MCV.",

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

      "title": "1043 A Rare Case of Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder in A Sighted Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder which causes failure of endogenous circadian rhythm cycles to synchronize to a 24-hour day. Despite an unknown prevalence in sighted people, it's thought to be rare. We present a case of a sighted patient with concurrent bipolar disorder who presented with excessive sleepiness since preadolescence, and was later found to have N24SWD. Report of case(s) A 29 year old woman with bipolar disorder presented with excessive daytime sleepiness and irregular sleep schedule since age 12. During her teenage years she often fell asleep at school, and she felt the sleepiness could be associated with psychotropic medication. As she grew up, despite her bipolar disorder was well-controlled, the daytime sleepiness persisted, which caused great challenge concentrating at work and difficulty holding a job. She denies cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or restless legs syndrome symptoms. She had no history of shift work or abnormal movements during sleep. Her bedtime advanced and cycled through a 24-hour period according to sleep diary. Her rise time maintains a consistent interval with her bedtime. Previously she had multiple sleep latency test and polysomnogram, after which she was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. She was treated with several stimulants without much improvement. She was offered CBT-I but hasn’t gone. She failed trial of a standardized schedule and found it stressful. She tried melatonin and light therapy for a short time without much of success, she was subsequently started on tasimelteon and the clinical response is to be followed. Conclusion N24SWD is reportedly rare in the sighted population, with a possible different mechanism from that of the blind population. Behavioral and environmental factors might contribute to the dysynchrony between a normal central circadian pacemaker and a non-24-hour sleep-wake behavioral pattern. Our patient's sleepiness persisted despite her psychiatric disorders were in remission. Altered circadian rhythms are not uncommon in patients with psychiatric disorders, and circadian rhythm dysfunction may be a trait marker of bipolar disease. Some antidepressant are also found to cause potential iatrogenic circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Psychosocial interventions that target stabilizing daily rhythms in patients with concurrent psychiatric illness can be helpful. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Die Hypersomnie (exzessive Schläfrigkeit) zeichnet sich durch eine erhöhte Schlafneigung aus mit subjektiv vermehrter Tagesschläfrigkeit, ungewollten Nickerchen bis hin zu «Schlafattacken» und/oder verlängertem Nachtschlaf mit morgendlicher Schlaftrunkenheit. Die exzessive Schläfrigkeit sollte gegenüber Müdigkeit und Energielosigkeit, wie sie meist im Zusammenhang mit intern-medizinischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen auftreten, abgegrenzt werden. Die Hypersomnie tritt in der erwachsenen Bevölkerung mit einer Häufigkeit von 2–5% auf und kann zu Arbeitslosigkeit, Unfällen und neuropsychiatrischen Störungen führen. Zu den häufigsten Ursachen einer Hypersomnie zählen das Schlaf-apnoe Syndrom (SAS), die Narkolepsie, das chronische Schlafmanko (sog. Schlafinsuffizienz) sowie das Restless legs-/periodic limb movements in sleep – Syndrom (RLS/PLMS). Die Verdachtsdiagnose ergibt sich oftmals schon aus dem klinischen Beschwerdebild. Dennoch sind eine Polysomnographie und ein Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) für die definitive Diagnosestellung oft notwendig. Therapeutisch stehen die nasale CPAP-Therapie beim SAS, Stimulantien bei der Narkolepsie, eine Verlängerung der Schlafdauer bei der chronischen Schlafinsuffizienz und Dopaminagonisten beim RLS/PLMS zur Wahl.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

Partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night and phase-advance of the sleep-wake cycle induce temporary clinical remission: these experiments indicate that abnormally advanced rhythms are not merely an epiphenomenon but play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. They lead to the hypothesis that depression occurs in susceptible individuals when a sleep-sensitive phase of the circadian system becomes advanced from the first hours of waking into the last hours of sleep and interacts with sleep to cause depression.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

Alternately breathing and not breathing, the afflicted sleeper struggles to inspire through an obstructed upper airway or, more correctly, an occluded oropharynx. He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

      "title": "Review article on sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that involves a reduces or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe. It occurs when the muscles relax during sleep, causing soft tissue in the back of the throat to collapse and block the upper airway. This results in partial reductions (hypopneas) and complete block (apneas) in breathing that lasts a minimum of 10 seconds during sleep. Most pauses last between 10 and 30 seconds, but some may persist for one minute or longer. This can cause abrupt reductions in blood oxygen saturation. The brain responds to the lack of oxygen by alerting the body, causing a brief arousal from sleep that restores normal breathing. This pattern can occur many times in one night. The result is a fragmented quality of sleep that often produces an excessive level of daytime sleepiness. Most people with OSA snore loudly and regullarly, with periods of silence when airflow is reduced or blocked. They then make choking, snorting or gasping sounds when their airway reopens. A common measurement of sleep apnea is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).",

      "abstract": "1. A peculiar phase other than p. p can be seen in human natural sleep, . which might be called reverse paradoxical phase (r. p. p), for the relation between EEG pattern and the activity level of many other physiological. functions is the reverse of that in p. p.2. P. p and r. p. p are two different manifestations of the dissociation between EEG and many other physiological activities, especially vegetative functions.3. The fact that p. p is apt to appear at the end of each single sleep cycleand r. p. p comes at the beginning or in the middle of each single sleep cycle could account for the phasic shift of changes in EEG and other physiological functions.4. The prominent occurrence of p. p in the latter half and r. p. p in the first half of the natural night sleep could be attributed to the difference in distribution pattern of activity level of each physiological function. For instance, more occurence of EEG III can be seen in the earlier period of the night sleep, while the depressed or minor activity of GSR, blood pressure is distributed more in the latter half of the night sleep.",

They usually represent either the exaggeration of a physiological phenomenon (e.g. sleep starts) or a non-disturbing, idiopathic and usually benign sleep disorder (e.g. sleep talking and bruxism), which need only counseling and improvement of sleep hygiene. However, occasionally parasomnias are of clinical relevance. They can cause insomnia or hypersomnia (e.g. 'myoclonus nocturnus'), psychosocial stress (e.g. sleep-related enuresis and sleep walking) and injuries to oneself and others (e.g. REM-parasomnia). Finally, they can be symptomatic of neurological and medical disorders (e.g. sleep paralysis and 'myoclonus nocturnus'). In these cases special investigations including video-polysomnography can establish a correct diagnosis and allow a specific treatment.",

It presents the clinical history, examination, follow-up, treatment, diagnosis, and the results of the procedures performed on the patient. Actigraphic recordings for 2 weeks disclosed persistent muscular activity during the nocturnal period and two to five episodes per night of further enhanced muscular activity that corresponded to the eating episodes noted by the patient in his diary. The sleep medicine specialist established a diagnosis of sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) based on the clinical history and on the results of the video-polysomnography (PSG) recording. Low-dosage dopaminergic agents such as levodopa/carbidopa at bedtime, sometimes combined with codeine and/or clonazepam, bromocriptine and pramipexole, have been shown to reduce the eating episodes.",

During episodes of somnambulism, appetitive behaviors are unusual and, when they do, occur, raise questions as to the true state of consciousness of the patient. This is the first report of somnambulistic sleepeating in which polysomnographic studies were performed to document the sleep-related nature of the nocturnal eating. During all-night sleep studies, three patients complaining of eating during sleep had episodic behavior in non-REM sleep, consistent with a somnambulistic etiology. In all three patients, a conscious preoccupation with food was present and two patients showed a high percentage of slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest a concurrence of organogenic and psychogenic factors, that has been postulated previously to underlie somnambulism in adults.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern. REM without atonia or REM behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which the atonia fails to occur, with the result that the sleeper may actually perform his or her REM sleep actions.",

However, it must be remembered that this definition is arbitrary, and OSA is better viewed as a spectrum with trivial snoring at one end and severe, almost continuous obstruction at the other. In addition to the sleep-study findings, if the patient is sleepy during the day, as defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, then this condition is termed ‘obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome’.

Nightmares are part of a category of sleep disorders referred to as parasomnias—\"undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep\" (American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). Parasomnias are categorized by the stage of sleep in which they occur: NREM sleep—typically observed in the first half of the night, versus REM sleep—associated with the latter half of the sleep period. NREM parasomnias are also referred to as \"disorders of arousal\" and include sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals. REM sleep parasomnias include REM behavior disorder (RBD) and nightmares (dreams with negative content that may cause awakening). It is important to identify what kind of parasomnia the \"nightmare\" represents, as there may be serious consequences such as injury to ones' self or others that can occur. Additionally, as in the case of RBD, it may be a potential sign of another neurodegenerative process, such as parkinsonism. Polysomnogram is often utilized in the evaluation of parasomnias and can also be helpful to exclude other disorders, which may mimic these conditions.",

Sleep disorders in FMS patients have been widely reported in literature. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a syndrome characterized by repeated periods of upper respiratory tract obstruction and frequently a reduction in blood oxygen saturation during sleep. To make a diagnosis and define severity with the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), it is necessary to conduct a polysomnography (PSG) study throughout the night. OSAS cases suffer from frequent sleep disruption, are unable to enter the deep sleep phase and cannot physically rest. Therefore, as both OSAS and FMS cases have sleep disorders with symptoms such as a need for daytime sleep and headaches in the morning, it is thought that there may be a relationship between OSAS and FMS. The case is here presented of a 43-year old female FMS patient with symptoms including an 8-year history of widespread pain and fatigue, inability to get up in the mornings, excessive sleepiness during the day and snoring, who was determined with moderate level OSAS as a result of polysomnography examination.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Somnambulism is a parasomnia occurring in non-rapid eye movement sleep, and is characterized by ambulation as a disorder of arousal regulation. Sleep deprivation, alcohol abuse, fragmented sleep and certain medications can increase the risk of sleep walking. Report of case(s) Here we present a 35-year-old man with multiple triggers for sleep walking, resulting in recurrent parasomnia events over fifteen years. He had a history of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic insomnia, moderate untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), anxiety with violent daytime behaviors, and prior alcohol abuse status post six years of sobriety. He was sent to our clinic due to increased frequency and severity of events, with nightly events for the last five years. Episodes were characterized by walking around the home, leaving the home, and driving on occasion. He reported at least one minor car accident as a result of sleep driving. He also reported an injury resulting from a fall in his home while sleep walking. Several security measures were implemented, including door gates, door alarms, and hiding car keys. His family slept in different bedrooms with locked doors for safety. The patient’s chronic insomnia improved with cognitive behavioral therapy, leading to an average sleep time of five hours per night with no reported hypersomnia or daytime fatigue. After his initial evaluation, he was referred for a mandibular advancement device for treatment of his OSA, due to prior poor compliance with positive airway pressure therapy related to his PTSD. Optimizing his OSA helped decrease arousals that might trigger sleep walking events. He also maintained close follow up with mental health for pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25 mg at bedtime was initiated given the severity of his somnambulism. Conclusion The use of a benzodiazepine can reduce slow wave sleep duration by its effect on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our patient had multiple risk factors for parasomnias, with severe, frequent episodes of sleepwalking leading to self-injury. His treatment involved both pharmacotherapy as well as optimization of underlying triggers. Support (if any):",

Method We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity, recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and being unemployed. Results Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed melatonin production. Conclusions Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment.

      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

Reliable prediction of poor outcomes (death or vegetative state after 1 month; death, vegetative state or severe disability after at least 6 months) at an early stage is important for both family members and treating physicians. Poor outcome can be predicted with 100% reliability in the first 3 days after resuscitation in about 80% of patients using pupillary and corneal reflexes and motor response from the neurological examination, cortical responses from somatosensory evoked potentials and EEG. The predictive value of a status epilepticus or serum levels of neuron-specific enolase is uncertain at this time.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in children have a negative impact on mental and physical development, and a lack of sleep is one of the most important problems in infancy. At the age when naps are commonly accepted, the judgment of whether the amount of sleep is adequate has been based on the total amount of sleep per day. In other words, the idea is that even if the amount of sleep at night is insuﬃcient, it is not considered insuﬃcient if it is compensated for by taking a long nap or sleeping late on weekend mornings. However, these lifestyle habits disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause social jet lag, which is not appropriate for healthy mental and physical development. Therefore, in this review, I present the average required nighCime basic sleep duration (NBSD) of 10 h for Japanese and 11 h for Caucasian children as a judgment standard. (1) If the child sleeps less than 8 h at night, and (2) if the child sleeps less than 9 h at night or 30 to 60 min less than the required NBSD, immediate treatment is recommended. I also discuss briefly how to address sleep insufficiency in childhood.",

      "title": "Neurobehavioral Consequences of Arousals",
      "abstract": "The neurobehavioral deficits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are often attributed to the rate of respiratory disturbance or rate of arousals during sleep. However, sleep disordered breathing is also associated with other changes in sleep infrastructure that may account for cumulative waking deficits. This was illustrated in polysomnographic data from 1,521 patients with OSAS where increasing arousal indices were associated with increased duration of stage 1 sleep and concomitant reduction in total sleep time. Similar results have been found in paradigms in which sleep was experimentally fragmented in healthy individuals. It appears that chronic fragmentation of sleep, whether by apneas or acoustic stimuli, leads to cumulative homeostatic pressure for sleep, which may explain a number of phenomenan characteristic of both untreated OSAS patients and experimentally fragmented sleepers: (1) increased arousal threshold, (2) rapid return to sleep after arousal, (3) fewer awakenings over time, (4) increased sleep inertia on awakenings, (5) increased amnesia for arousals, and (6) daytime sleepiness. Elevated homeostatic drive for sleep appears to be a function of both the frequency of arousals within a night and the chronicity of sleep fragmentation across nights, neither of which have been adequately modeled in experimental studies of healthy subjects.",

Anecdotal reports (1) indicate that the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation may be reversed by naps even as short as 90 seconds during the day fol lowing the sleepless night. This paradoxical phenomenon, that sleeplessness ameliorates depressive symptomatology and that depression usually returns after the next night of sleep or even after short naps, raises the question, if in depressed patients, sleep may have a depressiogenic influence? N a p studies conducted up to now draw an inconsistent picture. G i l l i n et a l .

A study by our group (4) showed that naps at 1300 h reestablished depressive symptomatology in approximately half of the patients, particularly when the nap included R E M sleep. This effect was, however, confounded with a longer sleep length in the patients wi th R E M n a p s .

People who suffer from insomnia may be unsatisfied with their sleep and exhibit one or more of the following symptoms: weariness, low energy, problems concentrating, mood swings, and poor work performance. Insomnia can be classified based on how long it lasts. Acute insomnia is a type of insomnia that lasts only a few hours and is caused by a variety of factors. Many people have had this form of temporary sleep disruption, which usually goes away without medication. Chronic insomnia is defined as sleep disruption that lasts at least three months and occurs at least three evenings per week. Insomnia can be caused by a variety of factors. Insomnia is caused by a misalignment of sleep-inducing neurotransmitters. The Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index are two methodologies and indices that have been used to research sleep disturbances in insomnia sufferers. Many medicines, such as antidepressants and benzodiazepines, are used in the treatment, and drinking Melatonin-rich milk has also been found to be useful.",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "While REM sleep is the phase of sleep from which dream reports are most reliably elicited, dream reports can also be elicited from any other stage of sleep, including sleep onset and N3 SWS. Reports after awakenings from NREM stages of sleep tend to be shorter, less emotional, and less visually vivid than reports obtained from REM – but we do get reports of “dreams” from NREM sleep states. Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

      "title": "Relationship between the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and reports of anomalous experiences.",
      "abstract": "A whole range of anomalous experiences (1) has been reported during the hypnagogic or hypnopompic states that surround periods of sleep. It is not uncommon for people to experience brief, vivid, and often strange imagery or to find themselves temporarily unable to move or speak during these periods between wakefulness and sleep. These brief sensations and the temporary paralysis are known as hypnagogic or hypnopompic imagery and sleep paralysis, (2) respectively (American Sleep Disorders Association [ASDA], 1990). Recent surveys found that people who report more childhood experiences of hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery or sleep paralysis also report a greater number of anomalous experiences during childhood or adulthood (Sherwood, 1999, 2000). More specifically, hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery has been associated with reports of extrasensory perception (ESP), apparitions and communication with the dead, out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs), visions of past lives, and experiences involving extraterrestrials (e.g., Glicksohn, 1989; Gurney, Myers, & Podmore, 1886; Leaning, 1925; Mavromatis, 1983, 1987; McCreery, 1993; McKellar, 1957; Spanos, Cross, Dickson, & DuBreuil, 1993). In addition to the above anomalous experiences, sleep paralysis has also been associated with reports of psychokinesis (PK) and near-death experiences (NDEs) (Baker, 1992; Green & McCreery, 1994; Rose & Blackmore, 1996; Rose, Hogan, & Blackmore, 1997; Spanos et al., 1993; Spanos, McNulty, DuBreuil, Pires, & Burgess, 1995). The question is: are the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states conducive to anomalous processes and events or are normal hypnagogic/hypnopompic features being misinterpreted? Perhaps both statements are true? The aim of this article is to consider evidence for each of these possibilities. First, it is necessary to outline the characteristics of the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and the features of some of the experiences that can occur within them. CHARACTERISTICS OF HYPNAGOGIC/HYPNOPOMPIC STATES Most research, both experimental and survey-based, seems to have focused on the hypnagogic state (the period between wakefulness and sleep, i.e., just as a person is falling asleep). Comparatively little research has been carried out on the hypnopompic state (the period between sleep and wakefulness, i.e., just as a person is waking from sleep). Thus, this article focuses mainly on the hypnagogic state. The hypnagogic state, like the sleep state, is fairly complex and contains a number of steps and stages (Mavromatis, 1983; Rechtschaffen, 1994). Hori, Hayashi, and Morikawa (1994) concluded that the sleep onset period is unique and cannot be accurately categorised as either waking or sleeping. It is very difficult to determine the precise point of falling asleep, except by using arbitrary criteria, because the transition is gradual, because the changes are not always synchronised, and because there are large individual differences in when the changes occur (Lavie, 1996; Rechtschaffen, 1994). During alert wakefulness, eye movements are fairly rapid, and the normal EEC trace consists of irregular waves of high frequency (Bray, Cragg, Macknight, Mills, & Taylor, 1992). As a person relaxes or becomes drowsy, there is an increase in alpha activity (8-12 Hz), and eye movements become slower and less frequent (Parker, 1975; Rechtschaffen, 1994). In fact, the presence of slow eye movements is considered to be an extremely accurate indicator of hypnagogic mentation (Schacter, 1976). Stickgold and Hobson (1994) found that as the period of eyelid movement quiescence lengthens, that is, as the eyelids move less, mentation becomes more dreamlike. This contrasts with the positive association between eyelid movements and dreamlike mentation during REM sleep. As a person passes through the hypnagogic period into the early stages of non-REM sleep, there is a decline in alpha activity and a concomitant increase in slower theta activity (4-7 Hz; Baddia, Wright, & Wauquier, 1994; Bray et al. …",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common and clinically important problem. It may arise directly from a sleep-wake regulatory dysfunction and/or indirectly result from comorbid psychiatric, behavioral, medical, or neurological conditions. As an important public-health problem, insomnia requires accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Insomnia is primarily diagnosed clinically with a detailed medical, psychiatric, and sleep history. Polysomnography is indicated when a sleep-related breathing disorder or periodic limb movement disorder is suspected, initial diagnosis is uncertain, treatment fails, or precipitous arousals occur with violent or injurious behavior. However, polysomnography is not indicated for the routine evaluation of transient insomnia, chronic insomnia, or insomnia associated with psychiatric disorders.",

It has been recommended that adults, aged 18 –64 years, should sleep for 7 to 9 hours per night, however, many people struggle with sleep problems of various kinds and hardly meet these recommendations. Sleep is necessary for cognition, alertness, vigilance, and sustenance of attention as well as control of emotions. The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and other psychological variables have been widely studied. Sleepiness, the short-term effect of inadequate sleep, may lead to irritability, reduced alertness, poor motor skills, and attention problems. Among the long-term effects are obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and mental health disorders. Sleep deprivation in adults of all ages is defined as getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night.",

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

This literature review aimed to describe the types of primary headaches and their pathophysiology. Migraine is an episodic neurological disorder characterized by headaches that last 4 to 72 hours. This disorder is diagnosed when two of the following features occur: unilateral headache, throbbing pain, the pain worsening with activity, moderate or severe pain intensity, and at least one of the following: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Cluster headaches are one of a group of rare disorders known as trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of recurring headache. It's not a vascular headache or a migraine. The mean age of onset is during the second decade of life. Usually mild to moderate bilateral headaches with a feeling of tight bands or pressure around the head.",

      "title": "Jet Lag, Sleep Timing, and Sleep Inertia",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education. Although it is a small child it is important to have an holistic interdisciplinary team approach that focuses on the child as a whole and includes all professional disciplines and their existing knowledge in solving problems of the small patient. In the NICU, the basis of the team which take care of neurodevelopment risky infants are the physiotherapist, the neonatologist physician and the nurse.",

Partial sleep deprivation significantly reduced the depression symptoms (mean value, 30.1%). The interindividual variations were considerable; deterioration was rare, and in 75% of the cases improvement occurred. Execution is simple, less stressful for the patient than total sleep deprivation, and can be carried out at home. Partial sleep deprivation has no contraindications except in the case of severe physical illness. The duration of the therapeutic effect is varied; repetition is possible.

SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp.

CSA usually occur during NREM stage and rarely during REM. CSA is important to recognize because of complications ranging from frequent nighttime awakenings,sleepiness to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We present a 40 year old female patient with rare CSA during REM sleep and dream enactment. Report of Case 40yo African American female with history of loud snoring, witnessed sleep apnea, and daytime fatigue. She reported nightmares, sleep talking, and acting out her dreams without injury. Epworth sleepiness score was 5 /24. Her past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. She has no history of head trauma, no neurologic or cardiovascular disorders. Her medications include fluoxetine and,quetiapine. She denied substance use, narcotic use, or alcohol use. Her level 1 sleep study showed predominantly REM-associated central sleep apneas which is rare. She also was observed to have loss of REM sleep muscle atonia suggestive of REM Behavior disorder. Her sleep architecture was atypical with decreased N3 sleep stage. REM sleep duration was adequate. She was noted to have loss of REM muscle atonia based on AASM guidelins elevated chin EMG, excessive transient muscle activity, and witnessed movement during REM stage via video monitoring. During the study, she had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 13.1 per hour of sleep, Central apneas were predominantly noted during REM stage, 10 per hour, comprised of 50% of her respiratory events. The minimum SpO2 value with CSA was 94%. She had normal sinus rhythm. Her sleep was fragmented. A total arousals were 28.4/hour,and 7.9/hour were respiratory arousals, and the rest were spontaneous arousals. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 %. Her room air arterial blood gas was normal with PaC02 of 37 mmHg. MRI of the brain/brainstem was ordered given her atypical REM sleep. She had no acute intracranial abnormalities. There is a non specific finding of a low lying cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari I malformation. Conclusion Our patient has rare idiopathic central apnea in REM stage and is third case reported. She also has loss of muscle atonia during REM with dream enactment which is also rare in her age group. Injury precaution advised.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset disturbance), difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance disturbance), or poor quality (nonrestorative) sleep, leading to impairment of next-day functioning, including psychological distress. Published prevalence estimates of insomnia vary considerably, very likely due to differences in definitions, study setting, and data collection methods. However, estimates based on large population-based surveys provide a rather constant prevalence rate for chronic insomnia in the United States of about 10% (approximately 25 million people). Chronic insomnia is associated with numerous physical and psychiatric conditions and is more common in women and the elderly. Although it is often perceived as a symptom of depression, insomnia is also a precursor of depression and is associated with a substantial increase in the relative risk of major depression. Chronic insomnia is correlated with impaired mood, subjective functioning, and quality of life and, in some cases, with increased daytime sleepiness and accident risk. Those reporting insomnia have higher rates of absenteeism and health care utilization. Direct costs of insomnia have been estimated to be $13.9 billion annually, with a large majority of costs attributable to nursing home care. Chronic insomnia is a common problem, often associated with negative waking mood or function. As such, heightened clinical attention and clinical research appear warranted.",

      "title": "1226 Shift Workers Acting Out? A Case of Shift Work Sleep Disorder Causing REM Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is the manifestation of dream enactment with the failure of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Shift work sleep disorder presents as sleep disruption and/or excessive sleepiness due to an atypical work schedule. Here we show a unique case of RBD provoked by a longstanding history of shift work sleep disorder. Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

With age, there is an increase in periodic leg movements and sleep apnea; the most relevant parasomnia is the behavior disorder associated with REM sleep. There are also a series of problems, which although not specific to the elderly, have a greater impact on them because of their effect on sleep: lack of adaptation to emotional upsets, poor sleep habits, psychiatric affective disorders, organic disorders, use of drugs (psychotropic or others), nocturnal agitation and falls. Finally, although the problem is recognized as important in medical practice, not all doctors have sufficient resources to satisfactorily treat sleep disorders in the elderly.",

However, it can be useful in selected patients to identify other sleep disorders if they are suspected to be related to the insomnia complaints. In addition, when sleep state misperception is suspected, polysomnography can be used to show the mismatch between self-perceived and recorded total sleep time. However, before converting to pharmacological therapy for insomnia complaints, it would be wise to consider referral to a sleep centre that has experienced cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) therapists available.",

It is also evaluated as significant when it lasts more than 20 seconds, regardless of presence of arousal or desatura-tion.Hypopnea is defined as reduction in airflow wave-form width by at least 50% compared to width recorded at the longest period of normal sleep, for at least two re-spiratory cycles. Clinically significant hypopneas have duration greater than two respiratory cycles and are as-sociated with hemoglobin desaturation by at least 3% or with an arousal.Primary snoring describes presence of snoring with-out apnea or hypopnea, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, high arousal index, disruption of normal sleep architecture or daytime symptoms.",

      "title": "“Sleep-wake state discrepancy”: toward a common understanding and standardized nomenclature",
      "abstract": "People with insomnia reporting poorer sleep compared to estimates obtained from objective assessments is common across both research and clinical settings. Typically, individuals report less sleep and more wakefulness across a given sleep opportunity compared to that captured via objective methods (e.g. polysomnography) [1–3]. Many different terms have been used to describe this phenomenon since the 1970s [4], including but not limited to the following: sleep misperception [5], sleep-state misperception [6], sleep-state discrepancy [7], subjective-objective sleep discrepancy [3], sleep misestimation [8], and paradoxical- [9] and pseudo-insomnia [4]. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not yet well understood [2] and require future research to inform developments in the diagnosis and treatment (or management) of the disorder. The aim of this letter is to facilitate such work by highlighting recent findings and proposing a new nomenclature to become standard practice for describing this phenomenon. Insomnia is regarded as a “subjective” disorder, for which individuals’ perceptions of sleep and daytime functioning form the basis of its assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. However, objective measurements of sleep may also hold an important role. Clinicians have anecdotally reported that discussing the discrepancy between perceived and objectively measured sleep can be therapeutic. Preliminary findings [10] support this anecdotal evidence, suggesting that personalized feedback about the discrepancy between self-report (sleep diary) and objectively measured (actigraphy) sleep reduced the discrepancy on subsequent nights in a group of 40 individuals with insomnia when compared to those who received no feedback [10]. However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon and the implications for the diagnosis and management of insomnia.",

In addition, it briefly discusses the mental status changes that may occur at high altitudes. With mild hypoxia, lowered levels of blood oxygen may produce symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, clumsiness, and poor judgment. Patients may behave as if they are intoxicated. When individuals remain at very high altitudes for long periods of time, mental status changes may ensue. Changes in mental state, however, may be prominent, signaling a gradually developing or worsening hypoxia. Worsening hypoxia or anoxia will lead to loss of consciousness and may cause irreversible brain damage or death. Patients with chronic lung disorders are especially sensitive to inadequate ventilation during anesthesia. Individuals with sleep apnea are at risk for hypoxia during the night.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

      "abstract": "The appearance of the normal electroencephalogram (EEG) changes significantly from birth through the teenage years and remains relatively unchanged until at least age 80. Epileptiform abnormalities on the EEG may be either interictal or ictal. Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a continuous seizure lasting 30 minutes or more, or the occurrence of two or more seizures without full recovery of the baseline level of consciousness. EEG abnormalities that are slower than expected for the age and behavioral state of the patient are referred to as slow-wave abnormalities. Focal slow-wave abnormalities imply a local disturbance of cortical and sometimes adjacent subcortical structures. Generalized intermittent slowing occurs most commonly in diverse encephalopathies. EEG is useful in establishing a diagnosis of brain death; it should be used only when the patient has met all clinical criteria for the absence of any brain or brainstem function due to a known and irreversible cause.",

      "title": "Sleep pattern impairment in nursing students according to NANDA",
      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "abstract": "Dyspnea refers to the sensation of difficult or uncomfortable breathing. It is a subjective experience perceived and reported by an affected patient. Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) may occur normally, but is considered indicative of disease when it occurs at a level of activity that is usually well tolerated. Dyspnea should be differentiated from tachypnea, hyperventilation, and hyperpnea, which refer to respiratory variations regardless of the patients subjective sensations. Tachypnea is an increase in the respiratory rate above normal; hyperventilation is increased minute ventilation relative to metabolic need, and hyperpnea is a disproportionate rise in minute ventilation relative to an increase in metabolic level. These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea. Trepopnea is dyspnea that occurs in one lateral decubitus position as opposed to the other. Platypnea refers to breathlessness that occurs in the upright position and is relieved with recumbency.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of sleep are extremely common in the general population and patients with problems in this area are frequently seen in any clinical practice. Extrinsic sleep disorders are caused by transient stress or disruptions in the sleep environment. Jet lag and shift work that temporarily disrupt the normal sleep cycle also are considered to be extrinsic sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness is a very common presenting symptom. It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

      "title": "1221 Multiple Sleep Latency Testing in Patients with Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) has an estimated prevalence of 10-25%. Disorders of central hypersomnolence such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia pose a diagnostic challenge since commonly used psychotropic medications can alter REM sleep parameters on polysomnography (PSG). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has published protocols for the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), including a 2-week medication discontinuation period (MDP) prior to testing, however discontinuation must be carefully considered. Report of case(s) A 22-year-old female with obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and optic nerve hypoplasia presented with episodic EDS for several years. Epworth was 14 despite amphetamine-dextromphetamine 30mg twice daily. These episodes would last for 1-2 weeks without associated hypersexuality, increased food seeking behaviors or changes in cognition. Additionally, she would experience periods of not sleeping for days at a time, but not decreased need for sleep. She denied cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, or sleep paralysis. No symptoms of bipolar disorder reported. Initial polysomnography showed 432 minutes of sleep, REM latency of 39.5 minutes and AHI of 0.1. MSLT showed a mean sleep latency of 11.5 minutes without sleep onset REM periods. She reported later that she was unable to complete the MDP for escitalopram. The diagnosis at that time was hypersomnolence related to a mental disorder, and referred back to psychiatry. She returned 20 months later with more persistent hypersomnolence and a MDP was attempted again, this time with confirmation. She stopped venlafaxine and stimulant per protocol. PSG was again unremarkable and MSLT showed mean sleep latency of 7 minutes across 5 naps and SOREMP in 4 naps, resulting in the diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy. Conclusion Sleep symptoms are common in patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, and MDP can pose safety risks or be poorly adhered to. Longitudinal follow-up, repeat testing for persistent and worsening symptoms of EDS, and careful questioning about adherence to MSLT protocol can help clarify the eventual diagnosis. Support (if any) None.",

      "abstract": "Periodic movements in sleep (PMS) are stereotyped, repetitive, nonepileptiform movements of the lower extremities. A total of 409 sleep disorder patients were studied with all-night polysomnogram recording, and 53 (13%) had PMS. Such movements occurred in a wide variety of sleep-wake disorders in addition to insomnia. The prevalence and magnitude of PMS were not statistically greater in patients with insomniac disorders than in those with syndromes of excessive daytime sleepiness or other sleep-wake disorders. The results suggest that although PMS is responsible for disturbed sleep in relatively few patients, chronic sleep-wake disturbance is associated with PMS and may lead to the development of these movements.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a primordial requirement for human sustenance and its role in health is inevitable. Despite its importance, inadequate sleep is one of the most common complaints across the globe. Ayurveda identifies Nidra (sleep) as one of the three supporting pillars of life and attributes its maintenance not only to health but also to longevity and prosperity; in contrast, Anidra (disturbed sleep) is one of the contributing factors for disease. Ayurveda clearly identifies the factors in Anidra which are vitiation of Pitta or Vata (fundamental humors of the body), Manasantapa (psycho-social stress), Kshaya (debilitating factors), or Abhighata (injury/trauma). Insomnia is characterized by reduced quality or quantity of sleep and has effects on the quality of life of the affected individual. It can be the difficulty of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening, which can have a significant impact on the daily activity of the individual. The contemporary science is yet to give a definite theory for the physiology of sleep and the pathophysiology of insomnia. The most widely accepted and researched concept is the role of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, melatonin and their effects in the regulation of sleep–wake cycle. These neurotransmitters and their effect on sleep physiology and pathology of insomnia need to be further explored in order to improve its management strategies. Hence, this review aims to determine the possible relation between the concepts of Nidra (sleep) and Anidra (disturbed sleep) mentioned in Ayurveda and these neurotransmitter sleep theories. This will help in improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia, developing Ayurveda management protocols for insomnia, and also in explaining the pharmacodynamics of Ayurveda drugs better. The method used for review is by sourcing and analyzing the available data from Ayurveda and contemporary literature on the topic in discussion.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "abstract": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain occurring during nocturnal erections, without apparent penile pathology. Sleep loss caused by the disorder may result in severe anxiety, mood disorders, irritability, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Until now, the phenomenon of SRPE has not been well understood. The rarity of the published cases probably does not reflect the actual prevalence, which is presumably over 1 percent. Because of the bizarre nature of the complaints, patients are often referred to a psychiatrist. The authors present the case of a 69-year-old patient, who, during frequent nocturnal awakenings, experienced hard-to-define burning, tingling sensations in symmetric hypogastric localisation. Sometimes the skin of both legs, and, occasionally, the arms and hands was involved, too. Initially, however, no definite erection-associated penile pain was present. Micturating quite a small amount just after awakening consistently resulted in immediate and complete relief. After two years, painful nocturnal erections reoccurring at stable intervals of 90–120 minutes during sleep developed to be the leading complaint. In default of urological or gastroenterological pathology, the patient has been referred to a psychiatrist. Quite futilely, mianserin and alprazolam, later sertralin and carbamazepine, respectively, were administered. Clozapine has also been tried out; however, it has to be rejected due to some adverse effects. Finally, 10 mg baclofen in the evening resulted in complete and permanent remission. This is consonant with the literature data stating that only clonazepam, baclofen and clozapine are likely to have long term beneficial effects in SRPE.",

      "abstract": "RESUMO A sindrome da apneia e hipopneia obstrutiva do sono (SAHOS) e o disturbio do sono mais comum e se associa a hipertensao arterial e a outras condicoes cardiovasculares. Caracteriza-se por pausas repetidas na respiracao durante o sono, resultantes da obstrucao total ou parcial das vias aereas superiores. A polissonografia (PSG) e considerada padrao-ouro para sua identificacao. O diagnostico de SAHOS considera o numero de eventos respiratorios obstrutivos durante o sono e as manifestacoes clinicas resultantes desses eventos. Esta revisao aborda a apresentacao clinica da SAHOS, seus principais sinais/sintomas e a identificacao de fatores de risco que faci litam seu reconhecimento. Os sinais e sintomas mais comuns sao: ronco, sono nao restaurador, paradas respiratorias durante o sono, insonia, sonolencia diurna, fadiga e falta de concentracao. Os pacientes tambem podem referir cefaleia matinal, irritabilidade e depressao. A SAHOS e mais comum e mais grave em homens acima de 55 anos. A obesidade e o fator de risco mais importante. Alteracoes anatomicas craniofaciais podem causar reducao do calibre das vias aereas. Sendo a PSG um exame complexo e de custo elevado, instrumentos para uso na pratica clinica tem sido validados, destacando-se a Escala de Sonolencia de Epworth e o Questionario de Berlim. O treinamento de medicos da atencao basica e a disponibilidade de especialistas do sono com a incorporacao da historia do sono na anamnese e a utilizacao de instrumentos simples de rastreamento podem reduzir a subidentificacao da SAHOS, possibilitando o tratamento de um numero maior de pacientes e a prevencao de complicacoes associadas.

      "abstract": "This is an investigation of the psychological characteristics of males who normally obtain over nine or under six hours of sleep per 24 hours, and who function well with these unusual amounts of sleep. The study includes results from detailed sleep histories, sleep logs, psychiatric interviews, and a number of psychological tests. Short sleepers were found generally to be smooth, efficient persons with a tendency towards handling stress by keeping busy and by denial. Long sleepers were \"worriers\" and were chronically somewhat depressed or anxious; they scored higher than the short sleepers on most tests of pathology. This group also included some creative persons. It is suggested that the differences in sleep need may be a<i>response</i>to the above differences in life-style and personality and that sleep, and especially D-sleep, may have a function in restoring the brain and psyche after stress or psychic pain.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) defines insomnia simply as \"difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep\". Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD) are sleep dysfunctions related to circadian functioning. They are characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pacemaker is not entrained to a 24-h light/dark cycle. Affected individuals with a free-running disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome (N24SWD) have a longer sleep–wake cycle that produces a sleep pattern that typically delays each day. The disorder is seen in 70% of blind people, and among people with healthy vision, it is a rare pathology. Among sighted cases, 80% are young men and 28% have a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 14-year-old boy with a psychiatric pathology diagnosed with a PANDAS syndrome (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci), a sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood lability accompanied by obsessive compulsive-like issues and/or tics, in association with a streptococcal A infection that occurs immediately prior to the symptoms. As a comorbidity, he exhibited severe insomnia due to an irregular sleep pattern that strongly delayed his sleep schedule day to day. It affected his daily routines, as he was not going to school, and aggravated, furthermore, the psychiatric symptoms. He was referred for sleep consultation, where the case was explored by ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) using the novel system Kronowise ® (Chronolab, University of Murcia) and diagnosed with a non-24-h sleep–wake disorder (N24SWD). The first treatment approach for the patient was focused on improving symptoms during the acute infection and psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, sleep pathology was treated by light therapy and melatonin. After 8 months and different trials, it was possible to establish a treatment to normalize the symptoms and fix his sleep rhythm in a normal schedule as well as to reduce anxious symptoms during the day. The association of PANDAS and N24SWD has not previously been reported in the literature.",

Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden. Die kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutischen Techniken der Insomniebehandlung können von darin geschulten Ärzten und Psychotherapeuten mit Erfolg eingesetzt werden.",

Not all patients have all symptoms. When cataplexy is present, the disorder is almost always due to a destruction by the immune system of about 70,000 brain cells that produce a chemical called hypocretin. As this chemical helps in staying awake and regulating sleep and muscle tone, the lack of hypocretin explains all the symptoms of narcolepsy. In these cases of narcolepsy, the disease is life-long and does not resolve. When cataplexy is not present, many causes may be involved and the diagnosis is more difficult. Evolution and response to treatment are also more variable. Narcolepsy is diagnosed using sleep tests, biochemical measures and occasionally by measuring hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a lumbar puncture.

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as difficulty staying awake during the usual waking hours. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to be 18–20% in the United States. EDS may occur as a result of numerous conditions, including insufficient sleep or other central disorders of hypersomnolence, sleep-related breathing disorders, medications or substances, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, psychiatric or neurological disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, pregnancy, and various metabolic disorders and medical conditions. True sleepiness is the propensity to fall asleep and is not synonymous with fatigue or always associated with decreased vigilance. Excessive self-reported subjective sleepiness on validated scales such as the ESS may be useful for suggesting the presence of a possible sleep disorder requiring evaluation. However, patients may misinterpret fatigue associated with medical and psychiatric conditions as sleepiness or have an inaccurate perception of the degree of their sleepiness. Objective tests of sleepiness may be helpful to determine whether an abnormal propensity to fall asleep is present. The assessment and diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is usually made based on a combination of sleep history, past medical, psychiatric, surgical, and family history, a physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.",

In the moderate form there is a loss of consciousness for less than five minutes, usually with some retrograde posttraumatic amnesia. The severe category covers loss of consciousness for longer than five minutes, wandering eye movements, and lack of purposeful responses. Loss of short-term memory and coordination are the two primary deficits that occur after concussion. An athlete who loses consciousness should not participate again that day; any athlete who remains unconscious for more than several minutes should be hospitalized. An athlete who has had more than one concussion in a season can return to play when he or she is free of neurological disturbance.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatments of Pediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

      "title": "Non-24-Hour Sleep–Wake Rhythm Disorder in the Totally Blind: Diagnosis and Management",
      "abstract": "Many aspects of human physiology and behaviour are dominated by 24-hour circadian rhythms that have a major impact on our health and well-being. These include the sleep-wake cycle, alertness and performance patterns, and many daily hormone profiles. The rhythms are spontaneously generated by an internal \"pacemaker\", the suprachiasmatic nuclei within the anterior hypothalamus. This master clock has, for most humans, an intrinsic rhythm slightly longer than 24 hours. Daily retinal light exposure is required to keep these circadian rhythms synchronized with the external 24-hour solar environment. This daily synchronization process generally poses no problems for sighted individuals although they experience some of the consequences of circadian desynchrony when \"jetlagged\" or working night shifts. However, many blind people with no perception of light experience periodical circadian desynchrony. This is due to the absence of light information to the hypothalamic circadian clock, resulting in poor synchronisationsynchronization of circadian rhythms. Affected patients experience cyclical or periodic episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction, severely interfering with social, academic and professional life. The diagnosis of Non-24 Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder Syndrome, also named free-running disorder, non-entrained disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome remains challenging from a clinical point of view due to the cyclical symptoms and should be confirmed by measurements of circadian biomarkers such as urinary melatonin to demonstrate a circadian period outside the normal range. Management includes behavioural modification and melatonin. Tasimelteon, a novel melatonin receptor 1 and 2 agonist, has demonstrated its effectiveness and safety with an evening dose of 20 mg in and is currently the only treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA.",

      "abstract": "In neurological practice one often encounters various forms of disturbances of the waking state. Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis. It has become obsolete, and does not cover the clinical forms of hypersomnia. We have deemed it desirable to make a classification based on clinical principles, with due consideration for etiology.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is an important neurological emergency. It is defined as seizures lasting for 5 minutes or more or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness to baseline between the attacks. Refractory SE (RSE) is defined as SE persisting despite sufficient dose of benzodiazepines and at least one antiepileptic drug (AED), irrespective of time. Super refractory SE (SRSE) is defined as SE that continues for 24 hours or more after the use of anesthetic therapy, including cases that recur on weaning of the anesthestic agent. RSE occurs in 23%–48% of the patients and SRSE in approximately 22% of the patients with SE. In general, RSE occurs in patients with new-onset seizures rather than in patients with chronic epilepsy. The etiology of RSE in developing countries is dominated by central nervous system (CNS) infections and head injury compared to stroke and drug withdrawal in the developed countries. The treatment of RSE and SRSE is not evidence based. Following benzodiazepines, the second line antiepileptic drugs include sodium valproate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and anesthetic drugs such as midazolam, phenobarbital, and propofol. Most intravenous anesthetic drugs produce hypotension and respiratory suppression; therefore, patients with RSE are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In RSE patients, electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression with interburst interval of 2–20 s or even flat EEG has been tried. Recently, concerns have been raised on the safety of burst suppression in RSE and SRSE. The paucity of ICUs in developing countries limits the use of these management protocols. There is a need to explore intravenous AEDs with safer cardiovascular and respiratory profile for the management of SE.",

In this paper, the author describes the clinical steps in the differential diagnosis of insomnia symptoms for readers who are not specialized in sleep medicine. When patients complain of insomnia symptoms, physicians first need to check their sleep habits and optimize them if they are inappropriate and interfere with good sleep. Medical history and medication use should also be reviewed in the first step because some medical conditions (e.g., articular diseases, skin diseases, cardiopulmonary disorders) and medications (e.g., steroids, interferon, methyldopa, levodopa) can cause insomnia symptoms. Insomnia symptoms can be caused by a variety of sleep disorders other than insomnia disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given only if the insomnia symptoms cannot be fully explained by another sleep disorder.",

For example, sleep apnea in adults affects men more than women, is more prevalent in the obese, and presents with symptoms of snoring and excessive somnolence. In preadolescent children, sleep apnea affects both sexes equally, is more closely correlated with adenotonsillar enlargement than obesity, and may be more likely to present with daytime inattention and learning problems rather than frank somnolence. Likewise, the insomnia and associated bedtime struggles of a 3-year-old bear little resemblance to the insomnia of a mature adult apart from the fact that both individuals are unable to easily fall asleep. Sleep disorders in children are reviewed with particular focus on age-related changes in normal sleep and on sleep disorders that primarily or exclusively affect children. Pediatric aspects of other sleep disorders will be reviewed in more limited detail, with examination of how age, developmental level, and comorbid conditions cause clinical presentation and treatment to differ from that of adults.",

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

Polysomnographic studies have shown that, in comparison to normal subjects, the sleep of patients with panic disorder is characterized by longer sleep latency, increased time awake and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in REM sleep measures. Nocturnal panic attacks are non-REM-related events and occur without an obvious trigger in 18-45% of panic disorder patients. Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in REM sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep. The early reports of shortened REM latency in OCD could not be replicated by recent studies. A dysregulation of the REM sleep control system has been reported for patients with PTSD. Finally, no significant differences were found in all sleep parameters between social phobia patients and controls.",

      "abstract": "Summary Non‐rapid eye movement parasomnia disorders, also called disorders of arousal, are characterized by abnormal nocturnal behaviours, such as confusional arousals or sleep walking. Their pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, and objective diagnostic criteria are lacking. It is known, however, that behavioural episodes occur mostly in the beginning of the night, after an increase in slow‐wave activity during slow‐wave sleep. A better understanding of the prospect of such episodes may lead to new insights in the underlying mechanisms and eventually facilitate objective diagnosis. We investigated temporal dynamics of transitions from slow‐wave sleep of 52 patients and 79 controls. Within the patient group, behavioural and non‐behavioural N3 awakenings were distinguished. Patients showed a higher probability to wake up after an N3 bout ended than controls, and this probability increased with N3 bout duration. Bouts longer than 15 min resulted in an awakening in 73% and 34% of the time in patients and controls, respectively. Behavioural episodes reduced over sleep cycles due to a reduction in N3 sleep and a reducing ratio between behavioural and non‐behavioural awakenings. In the first two cycles, N3 bouts prior to non‐behavioural awakenings were significantly shorter than N3 bouts advancing behavioural awakenings in patients, and N3 awakenings in controls. Our findings provide insights in the timing and prospect of both behavioural and non‐behavioural awakenings from N3, which may result in prediction and potentially prevention of behavioural episodes. This work, moreover, leads to a more complete characterization of a prototypical hypnogram of parasomnias, which could facilitate diagnosis.",

Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",

Light and social cues are important factors that help align the endogenous circadian rhythms to the 24 hour day. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders can be due to abnormalities in the endogenous circadian clock (“intrinsic disorders”) such as delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, free running type, and irregular sleep wake rhythm type. Shift work or air travel leads to an artificial mismatch between the endogenous circadian clock and the external environment (“extrinsic disorders”) leading to shift work disorder and jet lag disorder. Individuals with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are presented with insomnia or excessive sleepiness or both. These disorders are under recognized in the general population but they can affect a significant number of people if a the large number of shift workers and air travelers are considered. The symptoms may be misdiagnosed for other common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia. Meticulous history and sleep diary data are integral tools in diagnosing CRSD. Actigraphs (activity monitors) may supplement the sleep diary data. In the past two decades major advances have been made in understanding the genetic basis of these disorders. Understanding the circadian principles has led to various therapeutic options such as phototherapy and exogenous melatonin.",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a period of relaxation and repair. During sleep, waste products of brain metabolism are removed. It plays central role in maintenance of physiological homeostasis and psychological balance. Sufficient sleep helps us think more clearly, complete complex tasks better and more consistently. One of the important function of sleep is to promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal recovery for proper brain functioning. Memory consolidation, brain growth and repair are other functions proposed for sleep. Problems related to sleep deprivation are being increased in today's modern society. Every day there seems to be twice as much work and half as much time to complete it, this results in a decrease in sleep or extended periods of wakefulness. Sleep deprived individuals may not have difficulty of verbal disturbances but research studies have shown that individuals have more difficulty in reacting well, to taking biological discussion and implementing the task with efficiency of action. Although day time performance due to sleep loss is experienced universally but in professionals such as paramilitary forces, army personals, who work under stressful conditions are more vulnerable to the sleep deprivation. These conditions become more stressful during emergencies and war because, after periods of extended wakefulness neurons may begin to malfunction, visibly affecting person's behavior. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a role in learning due to an activation of the hippocampus involved in encoding new memories. Many experiments have shown that the day after a good night's sleep, one may retain newly acquired knowledge or a newly learned skill more effectively. An enriched environment (EE) which is a complex combination of social, cognitive, and physical stimulation, improves learning and memory. Many changes such as increased brain weight, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, growth of dendritic spine as well as change in neurotransmitter content, up regulation of neuronal signaling molecules, neurotrophin levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been reported.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive. (8) DSM-IV-TR research criteria for PMDD A. In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1. Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopeless, or self-deprecating thoughts 2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being keyed up or on edge 3. Marked affectivity lability 4.

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

The apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) and the periodic limb movements (PLM) index were higher. Sleep architecture was also impaired. There were no abnormalities of oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide levels, respiratory rate or heart rate.New post-polio sleep disturbances were isolated symptoms.

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials.

A woman's sleep may be interrupted by issues related to her menstrual cycle, such as fatigue and sleepiness in those with premenstrual syndrome. Pregnancy may lead to or worsen restless legs syndrome and/or obstructive sleep apnea and the hormonal changes during menopause may cause insomnia or other sleep complaints.

Inattentive symptoms include poor organizational skills, making careless errors, forgetfulness, trouble listening, and distractibility. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms include restlessness, excessive talking, and interrupting. For the purpose of diagnosis, symptom manifestation should be developmentally inappropriate and exhibited in two or more settings (e.g., home and school). Much of the research in the past decade has focused on deficits associated with the disorder in regard to executive function, response inhibition, cognitive control, and motivational dysfunction in response to delayed reinforcers.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

It is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and reduced motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation. Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to neural dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders in fatigue. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and on overcoming it.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder: State of the science and challenges for the future",
      "abstract": "Summary Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self‐report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive‐behavioural models to (epi‐) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep–wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive‐behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first‐line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive‐behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non‐response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders.",

We report the case of a 17-year-old man who had been referred to us with frequent arousal following sudden dyspnea. On polysomnography, no respiratory disturbances and periodic limb movements were found during the sleep study, but frequent events of arousal were reported (arousal index: 12.3/h). On a 24-hr esophageal pH monitoring test, his DeMeester score was 176.43 and the total reflux time was 1120.9 min (76.9%), indicating the presence of significant acid reflux. After treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor, the arousals following nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue in the morning disappeared in the patient. GERD should be considered as a cause of spontaneous arousal or awakening not accompanying respiratory disturbances. Key words: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Arousal, Dyspnea, DeMeester",

      "abstract": "For most cases of endogenous depression (major depression), the hypothesis of monoamine deficiency, despite a number of limitations it faces, is still considered the most acceptable explanation. The main difficulty faced by this hypothesis is the reason for the decrease in the level of cerebral monoamines (primarily serotonin) during depression. It is assumed either increased activity of the MAO enzyme, which metabolizes serotonin, or a mutation with the loss of function of the gene of the Tph-2 enzyme, which synthesizes serotonin, as possible causes. In this review, a third cause is proposed, which can explain a number of cases of «spontaneous» onset of depressive symptoms in apparently healthy people, as well as links the hypotheses of “monoamine deficiency” and “disturbances in circadian rhythms.” It is assumed that the formation of endogenous depression is due to a combination of two factors: a reduced “basal” level of cerebral serotonin and excessively long pre-morning periods of REM sleep, during which the release of cerebral monoamines stops altogether. As a possible way to of non-drug treatment of depression, not deprivation, but fragmentation of this phase of sleep is suggested, that is much easier for patients to tolerate.",

The main cause of OSAS in children in adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The most common clinical manifestations of OSAS are: nocturnal snoring, respiratory pauses, restless sleep and mouth breathing. Nocturnal pulse oximetry, nocturnal noise audio/videotape recording and nap polysomnography are useful tools for screening suspected cases of OSAS in children, and the gold-standard for diagnosis is overnight polysomnography in the sleep laboratory. On the contrary of SAOS adults, children usually present: less arousals associated to apnea events, more numerous apneas/hypopneas during REM sleep, and more significant oxihemoglobin dessaturation even in short apneas. The treatment of OSAS may be surgical (adenotonsillectomy, craniofacial abnormalities correction, tracheostomy) or clinical (sleep hygiene, continuous positive airway pressure – CPAP).",

These mechanisms of cough have their homology in the circuit of chronic pain, and on that basis, should expand future research of chronic cough. Clinically chronic cough is easy to diagnose by an excessive response or hypertussia to low-intensity stimuli or banal stimuli, which we now call hypersensitivity cough syndrome, quantified by a positive reflex cough with capsaicin or citric acid. However, hypersensitivity cough syndrome can be impossible to quantify in the laboratory when the hyper-responsiveness originates in the central nervous system. This is normally caused by excessive peripheral input or convergence of stimuli from different sources. Once central hypersensitivity is acquired, peripheral input is not as important for activation of the cough.",

The most restorative sleep is delta sleep (slow wave sleep or deep sleep) that occurs in Stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep; it is during these stages that one is the most difficult to waken. Individuals waken during REM sleep, but the state of being awake is normally so brief that it is not recalled later when in the true wake state.

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

On the one hand they may appear as a symptom of a disorder, which may also be a diagnostic criterion, as for example in affective disorders, on the other hand they may be independent disorders or last but not least sequelae of psychiatric disorders or their pharmacological therapy, as with antidepressants or neuroleptics, which may cause or deteriorate nocturnal movement disorders. They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor. This is why sleep disorders should be taken seriously and treated adequately.",

The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

Death occurred between the 28th and 120th hr. Body motility, eye movements, respiratory and cardiac rhythms, chin myogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and crying were evaluated by careful observation and by polygraphic recordings for periods of from 1 to 2 hr. A very rich and continuous motility is described consisting of rapid jerks, either diffuse or localized, and of slow movements. Rhythmic movements of the chin or peribuccal area occur in bursts and are particularly striking. The paucity of rapid eye movements (REM) is also remarkable. The EEG is composed of silent periods interrupted by discontinuous polymorphic activity. The fixation of the cardiac rate, the absence of periodic respiration and of apneic periods are the most important vegetative phenomena. Crying occurs in short periods rarely lasting more than 20 sec. The state of these previable prematures cannot be considered as waking; it seems to be a very immature state of sleep that differs from both the quiet and the active sleep of full‐term newborns. This atypical sleep, which appears to be present in other species characterized by a great degree of immaturity at birth, does not give any evidence of cyclic organization.",

The anomalies that have been found to be associated with arhinia are: lack of olfactory bulbs and nerves, missing paranasal sinuses, high arched or cleft palate, various eye anomalies, low set ears - all in a very high incidence. Various degrees of CNS malformations have been found in part of the cases. Somatic anomalies have been reported in 50% of the cases. In two cases chromosome 9 anomalies have been reported.

      "title": "1000 Hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy and Parkinson’s disease (PD) share many similar symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, with or without cataplexy. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur while falling asleep and the person experiencing them typically knows they are not real. Here, we present a case of hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of PD in a patient without narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 66-year-old female with a history of tremor was seen in the sleep disorders clinic with chief complaints of dream enactment and excessive daytime sleepiness. She described bruising after falling out of bed. On further questioning, she reported instances of seeing “death and a grim reaper as well as a dark figure”, usually upon falling asleep at night. She denied daytime hallucinations. She underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG), which showed mild obstructive sleep apnea and loss of rapid eye movement (REM) atonia during brief periods of REM sleep. Treatment for dream enactment was implemented by increasing her dose of melatonin (which she had been taking for insomnia) and initiation of clonazepam, which led to significant improvement in dream enactment. Over the next two years, she was diagnosed with PD and started on carbidopa-levodopa. She reported more frequent hypnagogic hallucinations during a follow-up visit, occurring 1-2 times weekly, which her neurologist attributed to being on higher dosages of dopaminergic therapy. During a recent visit, she reported no dream enactment and infrequent hypnagogic hallucinations. Conclusion Sleep disturbances in PD are common and include insomnia, hypersomnia, and REM behavioral disorder (RBD). A lesser appreciated association is that between hypnagogic hallucinations and PD, as depicted in this case. Partial hypocretin cell loss in PD has been postulated to result in disturbed hypocretin signaling, which probably explains the occurrence of narcolepsy-like symptoms (including hypnagogic hallucinations) in PD. Hypnagogic hallucinations are more common among patients with PD compared to the general population and tend to occur more as PD progresses, with longer duration of treatment with dopaminergic agents, with older age, and in patients with RBD. This case serves as an important reminder that hypnagogic hallucinations are not pathognomonic for narcolepsy and are likely underappreciated in PD. Support (if any)",

Subjects fell into three groups according to presence of insomnia symptom (s) and/or sleep dissatisfaction. Results Insomnia symptoms occurred in 36.2% of subjects. Most of these (75.9%), however, reported no sleep dissatisfaction. In comparison, those also with sleep dissatisfaction had higher prevalence of sleep and mental disorders and longer duration of insomnia symptoms, and were more likely to take sleep-promoting medication, dread bedtime, and complain of light sleep, poor night-time sleep and daytime sleepiness. Conclusions Insomnia sufferers differ as to whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with sleep. Although insomnia symptoms are common in the general population, sleep disturbances among sleep-dissatisfied individuals are more severe. Sleep dissatisfaction seems a better indicator of sleep pathology than insomnia symptoms.",

Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

      "abstract": "Aim. To describe a clinical case of differential diagnostics of motor phenomena during sleep. Materials and methods. Patient B., 37 years old. Visit to a somnologist at the University Clinic. Complaints were mainly made by the patient’s wife, since the patient himself does not remember these episodes. According to the wife, sudden sweeping movements of the arms and legs, incoherent speech are noted during sleep, then the patient gets up, can grab his hands, behaves aggressively, shifts things. These complaints have been noted for more than 10 years, with a gradual worsening of symptoms. A neurologist at the place of residence suggested a possible epileptic nature of these episodes,but no further examination was carried out. Results. From a semiological point of view, motor phenomena during sleep can imitate epileptic seizures, parasomnias, rapid eye movement behavior disorders, and normal sleep motor phenomena such as fragmentary sleep myoclonus, periodic limb movements, bruxism, etc. A differential diagnostic search is provided, a comparative characteristic of motor phenomena during sleep and wakefulness is given, as well as a scale of frontal epilepsy and parasomnia, which can help the doctor in making the correct diagnosis. Conclusion. Conducting a comprehensive examination of the patient and clarifying the clinical diagnosis made it possible to choose the correct management tactics, avoid unjustified prescription of antiepileptic drugs, and reduce emotional stress in the family due to the ambiguity of the manifestations of night motor phenomena. The established clinical diagnosis allows monitoring the patient in terms of the possible debut of a neurodegenerative disease.",

PSG analysis was performed on current medication.Patients with IPD had a reduced mean percentage of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (80% vs 93%; P < 0.05). Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, indices/hour of arousals, awakenings, apnea/hypopnea, and periodic leg movements were similar in both groups. Age, but not dopaminergic medication, had a negative impact on sleep architecture in patients with IPD. There was no correlation between sleep efficiency assessed by PSG and sleep quality assessed by questionnaire.The results confirmed a reduction in muscle atonia during REM sleep as a characteristic finding in early IPD. However, there were no further disease-inherent or medication-induced changes in sleep architecture. Although sleep disturbances are considered to be an integral part of IPD, PSG cannot yet identify them objectively at an early stage.",

      "abstract": "Flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam are compared in terms of initial and short term efficacy, effectiveness during intermediate and long term use, withdrawal effects, and general side effects. The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hangover). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.",

      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

The objective of the present study was to raise the awareness of physicians in general, and psychiatrists in particular, about the importance of considering narcolepsy in their patients in daily clinical practice. The negative impact of narcolepsy on quality of life is significant and comparable to that of epilepsy or schizophrenia. Diagnosis is characterized by the presence of five cardinal symptoms: excessive daytime sleepiness; cataplexy; sleep paralysis; hallucinations; and fragmentation of nocturnal sleep. The multiple sleep latency test is used after a baseline polysomnography to confirm diagnosis. Associated depression, bipolar and anxiety disorders are highlyprevalent in patients with narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy are treated with stimulants and low doses of antidepressants. Interestingly, the abrupt withdrawal of antidepressants can cause a transient syndrome similar to cataplexy. Another common finding in patients with narcolepsy is REM sleep behavior disorder after the use of antidepressants. The use of psychostimulants, employed in narcolepsy for excessive daytime sleepiness control, can be accompanied by paranoid psychosis, similar to schizophrenia. The diagnosis, treatment, and management of narcolepsy associated with comorbidities are a challenge and should be given due consideration.",

As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related complaints are common in the general population. Prevalence rates are significantly higher among women and the older age groups. About 10% of those experiencing insomnia state that the complaint is chronic. Chronic primary insomnia results from the reaction to an emotional trigger or stressful event, which leads to the further development of sleep-preventing associations. Chronic secondary insomnia is that related to another mental disorder, a neurologic disease, another sleep disorder, a general medical condition, the effect of a drug of abuse or a medication. Sleep disturbances have also been described in pregnancy and during menopause. In patients with chronic primary insomnia nonpharmacological strategies and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics) are indicated. In patients with secondary insomnia the underlying disorder needs to be treated appropriately. Currently used hypnotics include benzodiazepine derivatives, the cyclopyrrolone zopiclone, the imidazopyridine zolpidem and the pyrazolopyrimidine zaleplon. In patients with chronic insomnia most hypnotics reduce sleep-onset latency, decrease the number of nocturnal awakenings and reduce the time spent awake. The increase in total sleep time is related to greater amounts of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep quality is also improved. Despite consistent effects on sleep-onset latency, zaleplon administration is not associated with significant changes in total sleep time and sleep quality. In contrast to the benzodiazepines and zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon do not suppress slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Sleep laboratory and clinical studies tend to indicate that benzodiazepines are only effective when administered for relatively short periods of time in patients with chronic primary insomnia. Furthermore, a rebound insomnia has been described for short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines. No evidence of tolerance or rebound insomnia has been observed in relation to zolpidem or zaleplon administration.

Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications.

They are relatively common in diseases of disturbed vigilance, like narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, and sleep apnea. These patients often suffer from attacks of hypovigilance, characterized by altered awareness, automatic behaviour and partial or complete amnesia for the attack. Because of the memory 'black outs' and the frequently associated hypnagogic hallucinations, the patients behave inappropriately and often appear confused. Confusional states also typically arise during basilar artery migraine attacks. This special form of complicated migraine predominantly affects young females and is characterized by symptoms and signs of brain stem dysfunction such as vertigo, ataxia, paresthesia, limb weakness, dysarthria; in 75% of the cases, disorders of consciousness dominate. Transient ischemic attacks are sometimes recurrent and, when involving the cranial basilar territory, may result in confusional states without significant motor dysfunction. Attacks of transient global amnesia are possibly also ischemic in nature and are assumed to arise from transient bilateral limbic failure. Affecting only memory functions, they are strictly spoken not confusional, but must nevertheless be taken into consideration when proper observation during the attack was not possible.",

Подростки начинают плохо учиться, пропускают школу, наблюдаются изменения в их поведении. Для больных характерны развитие двигательного возбуждения, суетливость, неусидчивость, чрезмерная активность, снижение памяти, ухудшение успеваемости в школе, нарушение сна, нарушения в двигательной сфере: тремор, грубые, хореиформные подергивания пальцев и отдельных мышечных групп, возможно развитие тиреотоксического периодического паралича, который может продолжаться от нескольких минут до нескольких часов и даже дней. Тревожные синдромы, связанные с гипертиреозом, как правило, осложняются депрессией и снижением когнитивных функций, таких как память и внимание. В проведенных проспективных исследованиях выявлены низкая степень невербального интеллекта, вербальной памяти и когнитивной функции, повышенная тревожность, аффективные расстройства, включая депрессию, слабоумие, в том числе болезнь Альцгеймера; отмечено, что за быстрой скоростью восприятия следует быстрое его угасание, провалы в памяти, нарушение речи и осознания себя. Лечение гипертиреоза обычно приводит к улучшению когнитивных и поведенческих нарушений. Однако когнитивные функции восстанавливаются медленнее, чем психоэмоциональные нарушения, что в конечном итоге приводит к снижению качества жизни даже после успешного лечения гипертиреоза.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "An electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded after sleep deprivation (SDEEG) in epilepsy patients often discloses epileptiform discharges (ED) when routine EEG (REEG) does not, but since sleep alone activates ED, activation during SDEEG may result merely from the induction of sleep. We retrospectively investigated whether SDEEG is useful when REEG containing wakefulness and sleep fails to show ED. Subjects were patients with definite or highly probable epilepsy whose REEG lacked ED and who later underwent SDEEG. All had wakefulness and at least stage II sleep during both REEG and SDEEG. Patients with ED on REEG were specifically excluded to avoid including patients with activation due merely to the occurrence of sleep. Patient and EEG characteristics were studied, including duration of wakefulness and each sleep stage and timing and characteristics of ED. Fifteen of 29 patients(52%) had activation on SDEEG; exclusively during wakefulness in 1, exclusively during sleep in 6 and in both wakefulness and sleep in 8. Activation rates were not significantly different between wakefulness (9, 60%), stage I (11, 74%) and stage II (11, 74%). EEG characteristics were similar for REEG and SDEEG, except that total EEG duration and stage II sleep were longer in SDEEG than in REEG, which did not influence activation by a logistic regression model (p > 0.05). We conclude that sleep deprivation activates ED independent of the activating effects of sleep and therefore is useful in evaluation of suspected epilepsy even when REEG contains sleep.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

SRVAs typically involve running off the road or into the back of another vehicle, with no braking beforehand. Because of a high impact speed these accidents are often serious. SRVAs peak around 02:00h-06:00h and 14:00h-16:00h, when daily sleepiness is naturally higher. Hence, time of day is a critical factor, as important as the duration of the drive. Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

Although exercise improved sleep for healthy subjects, it did not do this for the group as a whole. When we stratified the sample on the basis of self-reported sleepiness after a night's sleep, the patient group with reduced morning sleepiness showed improvement in sleep structure, whereas those with increased morning sleepiness continued to show evidence for sleep disruption.Sleep is disturbed in CFS patients as a group, but exercise does not exacerbate this sleep disturbance. Approximately half the patients studied actually sleep better after exercise. Therefore, activity-related symptom worsening is not caused by worsened sleep.",

      "abstract": "In noise effect research often the awakening reaction is maintained to be the only important health related reaction. The main argument is that sleep represents a trophotropic phase (\"energy storing\"). In contrast to this awakening reactions or lying awake belong to the ergotropic phase (\"energy consuming\"). Frequent or long awakening reactions endanger therefore the necessary recovery in sleep and, in the long-run, health. Findings derived from arousal and stress hormone research make possible a new access to the noise induced nightly health risk. An arousal is a short change in sleeping condition, raising the organism from a lower level of excitation to a higher one. Arousals have the function to prevent life-threatening influences or events through activation of compensation mechanisms. Frequent occurrences of arousal triggered by nocturnal noise leads to a deformation of the circadian rhythm. Additionally, the deep sleep phases in the first part of the night are normally associated with a minimum of cortisol and a maximum of growth hormone concentrations. These circadian rhythms of sleep and neuroendocrine regulation are necessary for the physical as well as for the psychic recovery of the sleeper. Noise exposure during sleep which causes frequent arousal leads to decreased performance capacity, drowsiness and tiredness during the day. Long-term disturbances of the described circadian rhythms have a deteriorating effect on health, even when noise induced awakenings are avoided.",

Primary insomnia is a dyssomnia characterized by a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep and the absence of restorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month. The polysomnographic test shows alterations in the induction, continuity and structure of sleep. Primary insomnia typically begins in young adulthood, has a chronic course, and it is more prevalent among women. Its prevalence among patients with chronic insomnia ranges from 12.5% to 22.2%. Primary insomnia must be distinguished from insomnia related to inadequate sleep hygiene or another mental disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The treatment of primary insomnia consists of nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, behavior-cognitive therapy) and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics). Few differences exist between benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem in terms of effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep. However, in contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone do not suppress slow-wave sleep. Rebound insomnia and drug addiction are uncommon. Resumo Summary",

      "title": "The Psychoneurobiology of Insomnia: Hyperarousal and REM Sleep Instability",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia (insomnia disorder—ID) afflicts up to 10% of the adult population, increases with age and affects more women than men. ID is associated with significant daytime impairments and an increased risk for developing major somatic and mental disorders, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Almost all insomnia models assume persistent hyperarousal on cognitive, emotional, cortical and physiological levels as a central pathophysiological component. The marked discrepancy between only minor objective alterations in polysomnographic parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is still puzzling. We and others have proposed that alterations in the microstructure of sleep, especially in REM sleep (REM sleep instability), may explain this discrepancy and be at the core of the experience of fragmented and poor sleep in ID. The REM sleep instability concept is based on evidence showing REM time to be related to subjective wake time in insomnia as well as increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients compared to good-sleeper controls. Our own work showed that ID patients awoken from REM sleep more frequently reported the perception of having been awake than good sleepers as well as having had more negative ideations. The continuous measurement of event-related potentials throughout the whole night demonstrated reduced P2 amplitudes specifically during phasic REM sleep in insomnia, which points to a mismatch negativity in ID reflecting automatic change detection in the auditory system and a concomitant orienting response. REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep and thus might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal, resulting in a more conscious-like wake experience reflecting pre-sleep concerns of patients with ID, i.e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, thus leading to the subjective over-estimation of nocturnal waking time and the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Chronic REM sleep instability might also lead to a dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas activated during REM sleep. Along with a postulated weakened functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, this might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression and anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia complaints increase with age and are frequently made by elderly people. Recently non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed more often, among which stimulus control. One of the stimulus control instructions is the advice not to nap in the daytime, based on the assumption that napping affects sleep quality the following night, due to a decrease of sleep need. This article discusses the function of napping and the impact of napping on sleep. The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep. Consequently, the assumption on which the advice against napping is based is wrong.",

      "abstract": "Major depression is a common disorder; nearly 10% of the population suffers from a depressive illness in any given year. There is a strong association between sleep disturbances and depression. The most common sleep disturbance associated with major depressive disorder is insomnia. The relationship between insomnia and depression is bidirectional in that insomnia is one of the symptoms of depression and chronic insomnia can be a risk factor for depression. Depression causes changes in sleep patterns and sleep quality. Depressed patients showed prolonged sleep latency, increased wakefulness during sleep, early morning awakening, decreased sleep efficiency, decreased amounts of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities. Depression is currently one of the leading causes of disability in the world. There is a direct association between the severity of depression and the level of disability. Depression has a big impact on quality of life of patients. Studies have showed that patients with major depressive disorder have poorer quality of life than persons from the general population. Effects of depression on quality of life are equal to or greater than those of patients with chronic medical conditions. Untreated depression usually does not go away by itself and often gets worse with time and increases a person's risk of suicide; it is a fact that up to 15% of those who are clinically depressed die through suicide. Clinical depression is treatable with counseling and medication. The majority of people with depressive disorders improve when they receive appropriate treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms during the treatment is related to improvement in the quality of life. Antidepressants are shown to improve quality of life. There are some tools for evaluating quality of life in depressive patients, today. These tools help us to assess improvement in depressive patients beyond the extent to which depression rating scales do. In clinical settings, quality of life instruments can show us when patients begin to feel benefits of antidepressant therapy.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

However, some antidepressant drugs do not affect paradoxical sleep, and other drugs, devoid of antidepressant properties, depress markedly the production of paradoxical sleep. The investigation of the modifications of sleep in depressive states, as well as of the effect of antidepressant drugs, may contribute to a better understanding of the physiopathology of these diseases.",

This begins with a complete history and physical examination, followed by laboratory testing such as polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and actigraphy. The treatment of sleep disorders caused by co-morbid conditions is discussed under seven categories, including the use of general measures (e.g., sleep hygiene, encouraging patients to develop good sleep habits, medication), treatment of the co-morbid condition, treatment of insomnia, treatment of excessive daytime somnolence, treatment of parasomnias, treatment of sleep-wake schedule disorders, and treatment of secondary or symptomatic restless legs syndrome.",

The causes of SB range from psychosocial factors to an excessive sleep arousal response. Some studies showed that SB episodes during sleep are under the influences of transient activity of the brainstem arousal. Nocturnal groaning (NG) is a parasomnia characterized by an expiratory monotonous vocalization occurring during sleep, especially in REM sleep and during the second half of the night. The pathogenesis of NG remains still unclear and many hypotheses arose, ranging from the persistence of a vestigial ventilatory pattern rather than an expiratory upper airways' obstruction. Sleep microstructure fluctuation might modulate the NG, since the end of the NG episode usually is synchronized with a cortical arousal and an autonomic activation. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiology of SB and NG, especially when the two phenomena are associated.",

      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

Treatment studies also demonstrate a close link between sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness. Reduced frequency of arousals from sleep with resultant reduction in the level of sleepiness is commonly seen in patients who are successfully treated for sleep apnea, whereas those who do not subjectively beneﬁt from treatment show no decrease in arousals or sleepiness, despite improved sleeping oxygenation. It must, however, be stressed that lack of fragmented sleep does not exempt one from feeling sleepy. Partial sleep deprivation may occasionally be seen in patients who are unable to sustain sleep from repeated sleep disruption. This is commonly seen in patients with anxiety predispositions or superimposed insomnia.",

      "abstract": "NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEPNon-REM sleep parasomnias are very common in childhood and are usually benign, rarely coming to medical attention.They typically arise from the first period of deepest non-REM (slow wave) sleep, around an hour after sleep onset.Over time, a spectrum of behaviours may be seen, even in the same subject, varying from brief confused arousals to frank sleepwalking.Agitated events may be seen, especially in younger age groups, leading to disturbing 'night terrors'.Despite apparent severe distress and intense autonomic activation, the child rarely recalls the nocturnal events.Because they are thought to reflect an incomplete transition from deep sleep to wakefulness, non-REM parasomnias are often termed 'arousal disorders'.Most non-REM sleep parasomnias improve through adolescence but may persist on a regular basis in at least 1% of adults.An enormous range of behaviours may be reported, some of which are complex and potentially hazardous.In adulthood, subjects appear to be more prone to exhibiting activities which may be considered 'goal-seeking' in nature, including eating or cooking.Males, in particular, while in a state of parasomnia, may engage in intimate relations with bed partners or display violence.Subsequent recall is invariably absent or severely diminished although some report dream-like or hallucinatory images, particularly if the parasomnia is associated with significant agitation.Common themes include spiders or other unpleasant visual imagery.Often, there is simply a sense of 'impending doom' causing the subject to rush from the bedroom, often vocalising and disturbing partners.It is usually possible to communicate at a limited level with subjects in this state although they typically display a degree of confusion and appear only partially awake.Typically, an adult with a significant non-REM sleep parasomnia will have events from deep slow wave sleep within an hour or two of sleep onset.Events rarely occur more than once a night but may cluster with several symptomatic nights in a week.Often, there are more prolonged spells free of disturbances.The behaviours across nights might be similar but are not precisely stereotyped.Triggers or precipitants are often identified and include internal factors that tend to deepen non-REM sleep (such as sleep deprivation) or external factors (such as an uncomfortable or noisy environment) which may partially arouse the deeply sleeping subject.Although controlled evidence is limited, short-acting hypnotics such as zolpidem may induce sleepwalking or similar behaviours in predisposed individuals.Similarly, alcohol in some may appear to trigger parasomnias, potentially through secondary factors such as sleep deprivation, increased snoring or a full bladder.By contrast, in clinical ABSTRACT It is common for general physicians to experience diagnostic doubt and trepidation whenever faced with patients who exhibit abnormal nocturnal behaviours or excessive movements at night.There is also a perception that expensive and often poorly available overnight tests are usually required for diagnostic precision.In fact, the majority of conditions, whether they be parasomnias or, more rarely, nocturnal seizures, can be reliably diagnosed from a directed history, if available.Although the evidence base for treating parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders remains minimal, accurate recognition is important for a variety of reasons.This review covers the diagnostic features of the full range of parasomnias and movement disorders that might present to a multidisciplinary adult sleep clinic.Throughout, it will be argued that the recognition of key or salient features obtained from a good history is the most important diagnostic tool.Indeed, when diagnostic doubt remains after a thorough sleep history, it is relatively rare for detailed tests to add much in the way of useful information.",

      "title": "Home Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), or Obstructive Sleep Apnea -OSA, is characterized by sleep disturbances secondary to upper airway obstruction. OSAHS is prevalent in two to four percent of middle-aged adults, and has been associated with daytime somnolence, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities, and increased likelihood of accidents and other adverse outcomes. The prevalence of OSAHS in older adults (65 years or older) is believed to be higher than the aforementioned estimates, but it is not as well studied. In fact, there are contradictory data suggesting that OSAHS prevalence levels off after the age of 65 years; a plausible explanation is that fewer new cases are identified among older adults. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the commonly used treatment (additional interventions exist, but are not used or indicated in the majority of patients).The reference standard for the diagnosis of OSAHS is facility-based polysomnography (PSG), a comprehensive sleep study that records and evaluates a variety of cardiorespiratory and neurophysiologic signals during sleep time. It quantifies the severity of disturbances with the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). Higher AHI values imply more severe sleep disturbances. Typically, a value of 15 events/hour of sleep or more is considered to be suggestive of OSAHS. Note that an AHI suggestive of OSAHS is not sufficient for the diagnosis of the condition, as the severity of symptoms has to be accounted for, and other conditions affecting sleep may need to be excluded.Portable monitors have been developed in an effort to substitute for the more costly facility-based PSG. According to the data recorded, monitors are classified into different categories. Facility-based PSG is a type I monitor. Type II portable monitors record the same data as facility-based PSG, albeit using fewer channels. Type III portable monitors are less comprehensive, since they do not record neurophysiologic sleep staging information. Type IV portable monitors are those that fail to meet criteria for type III devices (i.e., they do not record at least two respiratory channels).This technology assessment is based on a systematic review of the literature. In total 95 studies were included. Eligible studies assess the ability of sleep studies at baseline to predict response to CPAP treatment or CPAP use; the comparison of measurements with portable monitors and facility-based PSG; and the safety of sleep studies. We note that the current technology assessment focuses on adult patients, and did not consider pediatric populations.",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

Also, they have even been diagnosed erroneously with a psychotic disorder in case of coexistence with hypnagogic hallucination. EDS can seriously affect the person's quality of life by causing decreased academic achievement or work performance, low self esteem, and social withdrawal. EDS is also frequently associated with various medical and psychiatric conditions, and often fatal traffic or on-the-job accidents. The causes of EDS range from insufficient sleep to central nervous system-originated hypersomnia. The conditions that can lead to EDS include circadian rhythm disorders, primary disorders of alertness such as narcolepsy, sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, sleep-related movement disorders such as periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome, chronic medical conditions such as cancer, and medications causing sleepiness. Treatment options should be tailored according to the underlying condition and include sufficient sleep time, light therapy, sleep scheduling, wakefulness-promoting medications, or mechanical airway managements such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).",

      "abstract": "Headache pain impacts most of the population at some point in life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence and severity of headaches has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between headaches and sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both headaches and sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep and headaches in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower headache frequency and severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower headache severity and shorter headache duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer headache duration and greater headache severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater headache severity and is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality and headache severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep and headache.",

      "abstract": "Sleep bruxism (SB) is reported by 8% of the adult population and is mainly associated with rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) characterized by repetitive jaw muscle contractions (3 bursts or more at a frequency of 1 Hz). The consequences of SB may include tooth destruction, jaw pain, headaches, or the limitation of mandibular movement, as well as tooth-grinding sounds that disrupt the sleep of bed partners. SB is probably an extreme manifestation of a masticatory muscle activity occurring during the sleep of most normal subjects, since RMMA is observed in 60% of normal sleepers in the absence of grinding sounds. The pathophysiology of SB is becoming clearer, and there is an abundance of evidence outlining the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of rhythmic jaw movements (RJM) in relation to chewing, swallowing, and breathing. The sleep literature provides much evidence describing the mechanisms involved in the reduction of muscle tone, from sleep onset to the atonia that characterizes rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Several brainstem structures ( e.g., reticular pontis oralis, pontis caudalis, parvocellularis) and neurochemicals ( e.g., serotonin, dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid [GABA], noradrenaline) are involved in both the genesis of RJM and the modulation of muscle tone during sleep. It remains unknown why a high percentage of normal subjects present RMMA during sleep and why this activity is three times more frequent and higher in amplitude in SB patients. It is also unclear why RMMA during sleep is characterized by co-activation of both jaw-opening and jaw-closing muscles instead of the alternating jaw-opening and jaw-closing muscle activity pattern typical of chewing. The final section of this review proposes that RMMA during sleep has a role in lubricating the upper alimentary tract and increasing airway patency. The review concludes with an outline of questions for future research.",

Under this aspect three types of course may be described: (1) grand mal épilepsies with attacks predominantly following waking and during the period of relaxation following work (“Feierabend”), the so‐called awakening epilepsies; (2) grand mal épilepsies with attacks mainly after falling asleep or before waking, the so‐called sleep epilepsies; (3) grand mal épilepsies with irregular dispersed attacks, the so‐called diffuse epilepsies. As a rule these types remain constant even in cases of considerable duration. Transitions occur from awakening epilepsy to sleep epilepsy or to diffuse epilepsy and from sleep epilepsy to diffuse epilepsy, but not vice versa . The described types differ in the following clinical features: 90% of awakening epilepsies are cryptogenetic, have a ratio of heredity of 12.5%, and generally start first between the ages of 10 and 25; where they are found in combination they are mostly linked with the petit mal triad; the intervals between fits are to a large extent irregular; the fits themselves are in most cases precipitated by lack of sleep and consumption of alcohol. Seventy‐seven percent of sleep epilepsies are cryptogenetic, have a ratio of heredity of 7.7%, and there is no predilection for a particular age; where combined they are mostly linked with psychomotor fits; the intervals between fits are to a large extent regular; the fits themselves are but rarely caused by external circumstances. Diffuse epilepsies are mainly symptomatic (53%), have a ratio of heredity of 3.8% and there is no predilection for a particular age; where combined they are mostly linked with psychomotor fits or Jacksonian seizures; the intervals between fits are to a large extent irregular; the fits themselves are precipitated by a variety of factors whose common denominator is found by acute disturbances of the cerebral circulation. Clinical and electroencephalographical investigations have revealed fundamental differences in the sleep behaviour of patients suffering from awakening or from sleep epilepsies, whereas patients suffering from diffuse epilepsies show no special characteristic in this respect. The differences in sleep patterns apply to the quality – insofar as both achieve their deep sleep maxima at different times in the course of the sleep – as well as to the quantity, since patients with sleep epilepsy sleep too much, i.e ., have too much deep sleep whilst patients with epilepsy on awakening sleep too little, i.e ., have too much shallow sleep. To this corresponds a different behaviour during consciousness, which is correlated electroencephalographically in the case of sleep épilepsies – excepting abnormalities peculiar to the disease – with a regular basic rhythm of a constant frequency; in the case of awakening epilepsies, however, it is correlated with a variable EEG, i.e ., unstable in frequency and disturbed in rhythm. Patients with sleep and patients with awakening epilepsy further differ in their psychical behaviour, in their somatic condition, in their vegetative functions, in their development during puberty and in their instinctive behaviour. The author reported in detail on the investigations by Christian and Ganshirt dealing with their EEG‐findings on pure and combined grand mal epilepsies in waking as well as in sleep. They have shown that sleep epilepsies have generally a normal standard EEG with few general abnormalities and hardly react to hyperventilation, whereas in natural sleep they show considerable increase of specific attack potentials, which never consist of spike‐wave‐complexes, but almost exclusively of bilaterally symmetrical or synchronised steep outbursts or temporal peaks. In the case of awakening epilepsies however we discern very frequently general abnormalities already in the standard EEG, as well as diffuse or paroxysmal dysrhythmia or specific attack potentials, which are yet increased during hyperventilation and represent almost exclusively only 3–4/sec spikes and waves or multi‐spikes‐waves. The increase of specific attack findings between the EEG during waking and the sleep EEG amounts to 1: 1.2 in the case of awakening epilepsies and 1: 10 in the case of sleep epilepsies. Diffuse epilepsies are closer to sleep epilepsies as regards their little reaction to hyperventilation, but closer to awakening epilepsies as regards their low rate of increase in specific attack potentials during sleep (1: 1.5). As for the question of the cerebral localisation, which was investigated on the basis of 141 patients with grand mal epilepsies following circumscribed brain injuries and locatable brain tumours, a relationship was found to be probable insofar as frontal brain injuries lead mainly to sleep epilepsy but parietal brain injuries mainly to diffuse epilepsy. No correlations could be established where awakening epilepsies and other localisations are concerned. The biological antagonism between awakening epilepsy and sleep epilepsy is reflected in a different response to antiepileptic drugs. Sleep epilepsies respond well to hydantoins and badly to phenobarbitone, awakening epilepsies respond well to phenobarbitone and only poorly to hydantoins. No particular differences in the effectiveness of mysoline have been shown when adminstered to either type. For diffuse epilepsies there is no medicament of outstanding effectiveness. RÉSUMÉ A côté de la classification usuelle des crises mineures en brusques crises corticales Jacksonniennes, crises psychomotrices rhinencéphaliques et crises centrencéphaliques de la triade du petit mal, nous trouvons une autre classification de crises majeures que gouverne leur indépendance ou leur dépendance du cycle de l'épilepsie sommeil‐vigile. Ainsi présentés on peut décrire trois types de cours de la maladie: (1) épilepsies de grand mal dont les crises surviennent en prédominance après le réveil et pendant la période de relaxation qui fait suite au travail (Feierabend“), ces épilepsies sont dites épilepsies du réveil; (2) épilepsies de grand mal dont les crises se produisent principalement apres que le patient se soit endormi ou avant son réveil: épilepsies dites en sommeil; (3) épilepsies de grand mal avec crises se dispersant irrégulièrement, épilepsies dites épilepsies diffuses. Selon la règle, ces types restent constants même dans les cas de très longue durée. II survient des transitions de l'épilepsie du réveil à l'épilepsie en sommeil ou à l'épilepsie diffuse, et de l'épilepsie en sommeil à l'épilepsie diffuse, mais non vice versa . Les types décrits différent selon les traits cliniques suivants: 90% des épilepsies à l'état du réveil sont cryptogénétiques, elles sont héréditaires en une proportion de 12.5% et débutent généralement entre 10 et 25 ans; quand on les trouve en combinaison, elles sont le plus souvent en rapport avec la triade du petit mal; les intervalles entre les crises sont fortement irréguliers; les crises mêmes sont, dans la plupart des cas, précipitées par un besoin de sommeil ou une consommation d'alcool. Soixantedix‐sept pour cent d'épilepsies à l'état de sommeil sont cryptogénétiques, elles sont héréditaires en 7.7% des cas et ne montrent aucune prédilection pour un âge quelconque; quand elles sont combinées, elles sont le plus souvent unies à des crises psychomotrices; les intervalles entre les crises sont en forte mesure réguliers; les crises mêmes ne sont que rarement causées par des circonstances externes. Les épilepsies diffuses sont principalement symptomatiques (53%), leur pourcentage d'hérédité est de 3.8% et elles ne montrent point de prédilection pour un âge quelconque; quand elles sont combinées, elles sont souvent unies à des crises psychomotrices ou des crises Jacksonniennes; les intervalles entre les crises sont fortement irréguliers; les crises mêmes sont précipitées par des facteurs variés dont le dénominateur commun est situé dans un trouble aigu de la circulation cérébrale. Des recherches cljniques et encéphalographiques ont révélé des différences fondamentales dans le comportement du sommeil des malades souffrant d'épilepsies du réveil ou à l'état de sommeil tandis que les épilepsies diffuses ne présentent aucune caractéristique spéciale sous ce rapport. Les différences entre les types du sommeil s'appliquent à la qualité– pour autant que les deux genres achèvent leurs maximums de profond sommeil à différents moments du cours du sommeil – tout aussi bien qu'à la quantité puisque les épileptiques en sommeil dorment trop, c'est‐à‐dire dorment trop d'un sommeil profond, tandis que les épileptiques dont les crises surviennent pendant le réveil dorment trop peu, c'est‐à‐dire qu'ils ont trop de sommeil léger. II correspond à ceci un comportement différent durent l'état conscient, ce qui est en correlation avec l'encéphalogramme en cas d'épilepsie en sommeil – exception faite des anomalies propres à la maladie – avec un rythme de base régulier de fréquence constante; toutefois, en cas d'épilepsie du réveil ce rapport s'établit avec un E.E.G. variable, c'est‐à‐dire de fréquence instable et de rythme troublé. Les malades avec épilepsie en sommeil et ceux avec épilepsie à l'état de veille diffèrent de plus dans leur comportement psychique, dans leur condition somatique, dans leurs fonctions végétatives, dans leur développement au cours de la puberté et dans leur comportement instinctif. L'auteur rapporte en détail les recherches de Christian et Gänshirt qui communiquent leurs découvertes faites dans l'E.E.G. sur les épilepsies pures et combinées de grand mal en épilepsies en vigile tout comme en sommeil. Ils ont démontré que les épilepsies en sommeil ont le plus souvent un standard normal d'E.E.G. avec peu d'anomalies et qu'elles réagissent à peine à l'hyperventilation tandis que, lors de sommeil naturel, elles présentent une augmentation considérable de potentiels de crises spécifiques lesquels ne consistent jamais en des complexes de pointes ondes, mais presque exclusivement en fortes bouffées bilatéralement symétriques ou synchronisées, ou en pointes temporales. Dans les cas d'épilepsie du réveil, toutefois, nous pouvons discerner déjà, très fréquemment, dans l'E.E.G. standard des anomalies générates et aussi des dysrythmies diffuses ou paroxysmales ou des potentiels spécifiques de crises, lesquels sont encore augmentés par l'hyperventilation et ne représented presque exclusivement que des pointes‐ondes de 3–4/sec ou des ondes multi‐pointes. L'augmentation des constatations de crise spécifique qui se produit entre l'E.E.G. à l'état de veille et l'E.E.G. du sommeil comprend 1:1.2 dans les cas d'épilepsies à l'état de veille et 1:10 dans les cas d'épilepsie en sommeil. Les épilepsies diffuses se rapprochent plus des épilepsies en sommeil en ce qui concerne leur légère réaction à l'hyperventilation mais elles sont plus rapprochées de l'épilepsie en vigile en ce qui regarde le peu d'élevation de leur taux d'augmentation en potentiels spécifiques de crises durant le sommeil (1:1.5). Quant a la question de la localisation cérébrale, que nous avons étudiée sur une base de 141 malades ayant des épilepsies de grand mal provenant de lésions cérébrales circonscrites et de tumeurs cérébrates susceptibles de localisation, nous avons trouvé la probabilité d'un rapport pour autant qu'un traumatisme du cerveau frontal conduit principalement à l'épilepsie en sommeil, mais qu'un traumatisme pariétal provoque principalement une épilepsie diffuse. II n'a pu etre établi de corrélation quand il s'agit d'épilepsie en vigile ou de localisations autres. L'antagonisme biologique entre l'épilepsie en vigile et l'épilepsie en sommeil est démontré par différentes réactions à des médicaments antiépileptiques. L'épilepsie pendant le sommeil réagit favorablement à des hydantoines et mal au phénobarbitone; en vigile, l'épilepsie réagit bien au phénobarbitone et mal aux médicaments à l'hydantoine. Des différences particulières dans l'efficacité de la mysoline n'ont pas été observées dans l'administration à l'un ou l'autre type. Quant aux épilepsies diffuses, il n'y a pas de médicaments d'efficacité spéciale. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Der geläufigen Einteilung der kleinen Anfälle in kortikale Jackson‐Anfälle, rhinence‐phale psychomotorische Anfälle und centrencephale Anfälle der Petit‐mal‐Trias wird eine Einteilung der grossen Anfälle zur Seite gestellt, die sich nach der Abhängigkeit oder Unabhängigkeit der grossen Anfälle vom Schlaf‐Wachrhytmus richtet. Unter diesem Aspekt lassen sich 3 Verlaufsformen beschreiben: (1) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit Anfällen vorwiegend nach dem Erwachen und während der Entspannungssituation nach der Arbeit (“urn Feierabend”), sog. Aufwachepilepsien; (2) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit Anfällen vorwiegend nach dem Einschlafen und vor dem Aufwachen, sog. Schlafepilepsien; (3) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit unregelmässiger Anfallsverteilung, sog. diffuse Epilepsien. In der Regel bleiben diese Formen auch bei längerem Krankheitsverlauf konstant. Überg̈ange können erfolgen von Aufwach‐ in Schlafoder in diffuse Epilepsien und von Schlaf‐ in diffuse Epilepsien, jedoch nicht in umgekehrter Richtung. Die beschriebenen Formen unterscheiden sich in folgenden klinischen Eigenschaften: Aufwach‐Epilepsien sind zu 90% kryptogen, haben eine Hereditätsquote von 12.5% und beginnen meist zwischen dem 10. und 25. Jahr; in Kombination sind sie meist mit Anfällen der Petit‐mal‐Trias verknüpft; die Anfälle selbst werden vorwiegend durch Schlafdefizit und Alkohol ausgelöst. Schlafepilepsien sind zu 77% kryptogen und zu 23% symptomatisch mit einer Hereditätsquote von 7.7%,; sie haben kein Prädilektionsalter; in Kombination sind sie meist mit psychomotorischen Anfällen verknüpft; die Anfallsintervalle sind weitgehend regelmässig; die Anfälle selbst werden nur selten durch exogene Umstände ausgelöst. Diffuse Epilepsien sind vorwiegend symptomatisch (53%) mit einer Hereditätsquote von 3,8%; sie haben kein Prädilektionsalter; in Kombination treten sie meist mit psychomotorischen Anfällen oder mit Jackson‐Anfällen auf; die Anfallsintervalle sind unregelmässig; die Anfälle selbst werden durch verschiedenartige Faktoren ausgelöst, deren gemeinsamer Nenner in akuten Regulationsstörungen der Gehirndurchblutung zu suchen ist. Klinische und elektroencephalographische Untersuchungen lassen fundamentale Unterschiede im Schlafverhalten bei Aufwach‐ und bei Schlaf‐Epileptikern erkennen, während Kranke mit einer diffusen Epilepsie in dieser Hinsicht keine charakteristischen Abweichungen bieten. Die Unterschiede betreffen sowohl die Qualität des Schlafs – insofern als beide ihre Tiefschlaf‐Maxima zu verschiedenen Zeiten während des Schlafverlaufs erreichen –, als auch die Quantität, da Patienten mit einer Schlaf‐epilepsie zu viel schlafen, d.h. zu lange tief und Patienten mit einer Aufwachepilepsie zu wenig, d.h. zu lange flach schlafen. Dem entspricht ein verschiedenes Wachverhalten, das elektroencephalographisch bei Schlaf‐Epileptikern – abgesehen von anfallsspezifischen Veränderungen – mit einem regelmässigen, frequenzkonstanten Grundrhythmus und bei Aufwach‐Epileptikern mit einem frequenzlabilen, dysrhythmi‐schen EEG korreliert ist. Kranke mit Aufwach‐ und Kranke mit Schlaf‐Epilepsien unterscheiden sich ferner in ihrem psychischen Verhalten, in ihrer körperlichen Konstitution, ihren vegetativen Funktionen, ihrer Pubertätsentwicklung und ihrem Triebverhalten. Ausführlich referiert werden die EEG‐Untersuchungen von Christian und Gänshirt bei reinen und kombinierten Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien im Wachen wie im Schlaf, die zeigen, dass Schlaf‐Epilepsien meist ein unauffälliges Standard‐EEG mit wenig Allgemeinveränderungen bieten, auf Hyperventilation kaum, im natürlichen Schlaf dagegen mit einer erheblichen Zunahme anfalls‐spezifischer Potentiale reagieren, bei denen es sich nie um spike‐wave‐Komplexe, sondern fast nur um bilateral‐symmetrische oder synchronisierte steile Ausbrüche oder steile Spitzen handelt. Aufwach‐Epilepsien bieten dagegen sehr häufig schon im Standard‐EEG Allgemeinveränderungen, diffuse oder paroxysmale Dysrhythmien oder spezifische Anfallspotentiale, die auf Hyperventilation noch zunehmen und fast ausschliesslich nur 3–4/sec spike‐waves und multi‐spike‐waves darstellen. Der Zuwachs anfallsspezifischer Befunde vom Wach‐zum‐Schlaf‐EEG beträgt bei Aufwach‐Epilepsien 1: 1.2 und bei Schlaf‐Epilepsien 1: 10. Diffuse Epilepsien stehen hinsichtlich ihrer geringen Reaktion auf Hyperventilation den Schlaf‐Epilepsien näher und hinsichtlich ihrer geringen Zuwachsrate anfallsspezifischer Befunde im Schlaf (1: 1.5) den Aufwach‐Epilepsien. Eine hirnlokalisatorische Beziehung liess sich auf Grund von Untersuchungen an 141 Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien nach lokalisierten Hirnverletzungen und ‐Tumoren insofern wahrscheinlich machen, als Stirnhirnschädigungen vorwiegend zu Schlaf‐Epilepsien und Parietalhirnverletzungen vorwiegend zu diffusen Epilepsien führen. Für Aufwach‐Epilepsien und für andere Lokalisationen liessen sich keine Korrelationen ermitteln. Der biologische Antagonismus zwischen Aufwach‐ und Schlaf‐Epilepsien spiegelt sich in einer unterschiedlichen Ansprechbarkeit auf Antiepileptika wieder. Schlaf‐Epilepsien sprechen gut auf Hydantoine und schlecht auf Luminal, Aufwach‐Epilepsien gut auf Luminal und nur mässig auf Hydantoine an. Für Mylepsin ergibt sich keine signifikante Wirkungsdifferenz. Bei diffusen Epilepsien ist kein Medikament optimal indiziert.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

Nightmares and night terrors are explained: night terrors are pure emotional experiences that occur on awakening from sleep and are typically associated with non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Nightmares are more likely to occur in REM sleep and, however unpleasant, are normal events suggesting that the maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep. Sleep walking, sleep talking, tooth grinding, post-traumatic dreams, and REM sleep behaviour disorder are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The circadian rhythm mediated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is primarily responsible for maintaining the sleep and wakefulness states.Numerous physiologic mechanisms and bodily repairs occur during the state of sleep along with functional alterations in both the autonomic and somatic nervous systems.Most individuals cycle through three stages of nonrapid eye movement sleep, accounting for about 75% of total sleep duration, followed by rapid eye movement sleep, which makes up the remaining 25%.Besides the above, endocrine factors like the release of melatonin from the pineal gland also have a significant impact on the initiation and maintenance of sleep phases.The emotional factors and the limbic system in association with a multitude of variables like stress, drugs, substance use like alcohol, appetite, and behavioral patterns are known to modulate a typical sleep cycle.Given below is a detailed review of normal sleep physiology and numerous sleep-related disorders, their risk factors along with their management, and a brief description of all factors that influence as well as alter the neuronal signaling processes of the brain.",

This category includes restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), sleep-related leg cramps, sleep-related bruxism, sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders (RMDs), sleep-related movement disorder due to a drug or substance, and sleep-related movement disorder due to a medical condition; finally sleeprelated movement disorder, unspecified when the disturbance does not fit into any of the above disorders. Some of these entities were previously categorized within the parasomnias or the wake-sleep transition disorders. Mostly, they involve simple, stereotyped movements during sleep or at the transition between waking and sleeping. RLS is a more complex disease with sensory disturbances occurring at rest and in the evening, and in which the motor accompaniment is mainly represented by the periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). All of these sleep-related movement disorders may cause fragmented sleep, insomnia, and/or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).",

      "abstract": "Typologies of sleep problems have usually relied on identifying underlying causes or symptom clusters. In this study the value of using the patient's own reasons for sleep disturbance are explored. Using secondary data analysis of a nationally representative psychiatric survey the patterning of the various reasons respondents provided for self-reported sleep problems were examined. Over two thirds (69.3%) of respondents could identify a specific reason for their sleep problem with worry (37.9%) and illness (20.1%) representing the most commonly reported reasons. And while women reported more sleep problems for almost every reason compared with men, the patterning of reasons by age showed marked variability. Sleep problem symptoms such as difficulty getting to sleep or waking early also showed variability by different reasons as did the association with major correlates such as worry, depression, anxiety and poor health. While prevalence surveys of 'insomnia' or 'poor sleep' often assume the identification of an underlying homogeneous construct there may be grounds for recognising the existence of different sleep problem types particularly in the context of the patient's perceived reason for the problem.",

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

      "title": "Defining, Assessing, and Treating Adolescent Insomnia and Related Sleep Problems",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of change with many of these changes influencing sleep intrinsically and volitionally. Neuroendocrine and structural changes to the brain result in adolescents experiencing a delay in their circadian phase. Despite their intrinsic delay and progressively later bedtimes, adolescents' sleep need of 9.2 h remains stable as they develop. Female adolescents experience an increased risk for insomnia following menarche onset. Associations between the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances have been found in studies of adult women, but more research needs to fully explore this relationship in adolescent females. Along with biological changes, adolescents experience an increase in social demands and responsibilities as they mature. The result is adaptation of the \"typical\" adolescent sleep schedule. For many adolescents, this new schedule results in a truncation of their sleep time that creates a sleep debt never fully repaid on the weekends. Numerous studies note a reduction in total sleep time following the transition into adolescence, particularly during the school year. The numerous factors that present during adolescence place adolescents at a greater risk for sleep disorders like insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction. These disorders are associated with daytime consequences like daytime sleepiness, depressed mood, attention/concentration difficulties, and academic difficulties. The current chapter highlights insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder, inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction with a focus on defining, assessing, differentiating, and treatment.",

The sleeping brain does fail and this failure is manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms; all sleep complaints should be taken seriously and investigated. Transient insomnia is uniformly associated with objective sleep disturbances which have been documented following phase shifts of the major sleep period such as that caused by transmeridian travel. However, the degree to which the individual responds to these factors is variable. There is a consensus that sleep medications are indicated for transient and short-term insomnia.

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

Manic and depressed patients displayed nearly identical profiles of PSG abnormalities compared with normal control subjects, including disturbed sleep continuity, increased percentage of stage 1 sleep, shortened rapid eye movement latency, and increased rapid eye movement density.

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Apart from some overlap between enuresis and the (other) classic parasomnias, the sleep of enuretic children is no more problematic than that of the general population. Recently, the exciting possibility has arisen that the low arousability of enuretic children may be linked to the autonomous nervous system and to disturbances in the upper pons.Enuresis is not just a nocturnal problem but a disorder of sleep. The high arousal threshold is one of three major pathogenetic factors in enuresis-nocturnal polyuria and detrusor hyperactivity being the other two.",

But after experimental deprivations of sleep the audiogenic paroxysmal seizures run only as initial motor excitement without obvious convulsions. Such sort of seizures promote a faster beginning of recovery process after deprivations and did not cause any disorganization of the function of the brain systems responsible for starting and shaping (maintenance) fast-wave sleep.",

El diagnostico diferencial es muy amplio, englobando otras patologias como diabetes mellitus, infeccion de orina, enfermedades nefrourologicas, oxiuros y alteraciones neurologicas. Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "title": "Therapeutic recommendations for management of severe hyponatremia: current concepts on pathogenesis and prevention of neurologic complications.",
      "abstract": "Patients with hyponatremia are exposed to major neurological complications. On the one hand hyponatremia itself produces brain edema, increased intracranial pressure which potentially leads to subsequent neuropathological sequelae or death. On the other hand excessive correction could be followed by development of brain demyelinating lesions (central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis) with major disability or fatal outcome. Understanding of brain adaptative mechanisms to changes in osmolality largely contributes to explain these neurological events. When serum sodium decreases, the brain prevents swelling by extruding electrolytes and organic osmolytes, a process almost fully achieved after 48 h. Conversely, during subsequent increase in serum sodium, reestablishment of intracerebral osmolytes occurs but their reuptake is more delayed (+/- 5 days). In both circumstances, these mechanisms can be overwhelmed, leading to brain damage. Acute hyponatremia (< 48 h) is generally hospital-acquired, mainly in the postoperative state and/or after excessive fluid administration. After abrupt fall in serum sodium, seizure, respiratory arrest and coma may develop and these manifestations are sometimes explosive in nature. Recognition of even minor symptoms is crucial and implies prompt correction. There is generally no risk of brain myelinolysis in acute hyponatremia. Some factors are suspected to aggravate the prognosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy, including female gender (menstruant women), hypoxia and young age. Chronic hyponatremia (> 48 h) usually develops outside the hospital and is generally better tolerated. The risks of brain myelinolysis can be largely reduced by limiting the correction level to < or = 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, if necessary, the initial rate of correction can be rapid provided that the final correction remains < 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, when other recognized risk factors for myelinolysis (hypokalemia, liver disease, poor nutritional state, burns) are present, correction should not exceed 10 mEq/1/24 h. Demyelinization is also observed in hypernatremia but it follows greater (50%) increase in serum sodium than from hyponatremic baseline. For symptomatic hyponatremia, rapid correction is usually obtained by hypertonic saline (3%) infusion. Another option consists in administration of intravenous or oral urea. Urea allows a rapid reduction of brain edema and intracranial pressure which is followed by subsequent correction of hyponatremia. Experimental data also suggest that treatment of hyponatremia with urea is associated with a lower incidence of myelinolysis. In hyponatremic patients without symptoms, there is no need for rapid correction and the treatment should be more conservative. Close monitoring of the serum sodium is indicated initially and if necessary, correction must be stopped and diuresis interrupted with dDAVP. Given recent experimental data, in patients overly corrected (delta SNa > 15 mEq/1/24 h), the risk of myelinolysis could be greatly reduced by rapidly decreasing the serum sodium through hypotonic fluids administration and dDAVP.",

Dream-enacting behaviors can also occur in patients with other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This clinical situation has been termed âpseudo-RBDâ. In contrast, OSA causes frequent arousal, which may consequently result in masking of RBD symptoms. We reported two patients with severe OSA, who were initially diagnosed with âpseudo-RBDâ but on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration, rediagnosed with âtrue-RBDâ.

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Seizure is often a manifestation or symptom of many medical conditions. Epilepsy is the occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. In other words, a seizure is a sign, and epilepsy is a disorder. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of individuals reaching age 70 will have a seizure, but only 1–2% will be subject to recurrence and become epileptic. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with normal exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG), 15–30% have recurrence. Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

This fundamental neurobiological behavior is controlled by homeostatic and circadian (24-hour) processes and is vital for normal brain function. This review will outline the normal sleep-wake cycle, the changes that occur during aging, and the specific patterns of sleep disturbance that occur in association with both mental health disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of primary sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and REM sleep behavior disorder as potential causes or risk factors for particular mental health or neurodegenerative problems will also be discussed.",

Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

The true extent of the problem is not known, but it seems certain that these syndromes are much more common than was generally assumed five years ago. Every clinician should be aware of the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea because of the rapid and prompt response to therapeutic measures. Sleep apnea syndromes, whether obstructive or central, can result in systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arterial blood gas abnormalities, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, chronic respiratory failure, sleep disturbances, narcolepsy, excessive daytime somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and the suspicion of mental retardation. The immediate and dramatic improvement produced by tracheostomy in the obstructive type of sleep apnea, or nocturnal ventilatory support in the central type, can not only enhance the quality of life for these patients, but return them to functional and productive lives.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS), which is one of the leading sleep disorders and can result in death if not diagnosed and treated early, is most often confused with snoring. OSAS disease, the prevalence of which varies between 0.9% and 1.9% in Turkey, is a serious health problem that occurs as a result of complete or partial obstruction of the respiratory tract during sleep, resulting in sleep disruption, poor quality sleep, paralysis and even death in sleep. Polysomnography signal recordings (PSG) obtained from sleep laboratories are used for the diagnosis of OSAS, which is related to factors such as the individual's age, gender, neck diameter, smoking-alcohol consumption, and the occurrence of other sleep disorders. Polysomnography is used in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders such as snoring, sleep apnea, parasomnia (abnormal behaviors during sleep), narcolepsy (sleep attacks that develop during the day) and restless legs syndrome. It allows recording various parameters such as brain waves, eye movements, heart and chest activity measurement, respiratory activities, and the amount of oxygen in the blood with the help of electrodes placed in different parts of the patient's body during night sleep. In this article, the performance of PSG signal data for the diagnosis of sleep apnea was examined on the basis of both signal parameters and the method used. First, feature extraction was made from PSG signals, then the feature vector was classified with Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Logistic Regression (LR).",

Although most of such complaints can be attributed to the changes in the sleep architecture as we grow old, primary sleep disorders are more prevalent in elderly [2]. Poor sleep due to these disorders results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. As we age, sleep efficiency decreases as time spent in bed increases. Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep. However, the decreased ability is less a function of age and more a function of other factors that accompany aging, such as medical and psychiatric illness, increased medication use, advances in the endogenous circadian clock and a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) can be conceptualized as a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and other accompanying symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairments. The etiology of FMS remains unknown, being one of the most accepted hypothesis the presence of central sensitization to pain and impairments in endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. The history of the development of FMS concept reveals how other symptoms -apart from pain- has become also relevant in FMS diagnosis and treatment.&#x0D; The central symptom of FMS is pain. FMS patients generally report high levels of clinical pain, which are related to greater impairments in health related quality of life, cognitive abilities and disease course. Fatigue and sleeping difficulties are also common symptoms of FMS. Fatigue have shown positive associations with pain, stiffness, sleep problems, increased body mass index, FMS severity, tenderness, disability, cognitive complaints, anxiety and depression. The majority of FMS patients report poor sleep quality, take longer to fall asleep, generally wake up during the night, sleep fewer hours, and usually wake up unrefreshed. Emotional disturbances (i.e., depression, anxiety) are also frequent in FMS. In fact, depression and anxiety disorders have showed a negative impact on the clinical course and work capacity of FMS patients. Cognitive impairments are also a relevant symptom in FMS. The most common complaints among FMS patients are executive function deficits, attention problems, forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, and mental slowness. Regarding the most frequent treatments for FMS, these can be classified as non-psychological and psychological. The former includes analgesic drugs, adjuvant drugs (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, etc.), nerve blocks, electrostimulation at different levels, infiltrations, etc. The psychological therapies with the most evidence are cognitive-behavioral, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness.&#x0D; FMS is associated with a severe reduction of health related quality of life and psychosocial impairments. It is necessary to take all FMS symptoms and its relations into account in order to provide a more tailored and effective treatment, as well as, to improve the health related quality of life of FMS patients.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

Sleep disorders during the prodromal synucleinopathy period, primarily isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and daytime hypersomnolence correlate best with the recently proposed “body-first” Lewy body disease progression. iRBD is the most widely recognized form of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, and patients with iRBD show abnormal α-synuclein in tissues and biofluids even in the absence of cognitive or motor symptoms. More importantly, individuals with iRBD have an elevated risk for near-term development of a clinically diagnosable symptomatic synucleinopathy. Other sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and circadian rhythm dysfunction also occur across the synucleinopathy spectrum, although their prognostic significance is less well understood than iRBD. Finally, isolated REM sleep without atonia may represent an even earlier stage of prodromal synucleinopathy, but further studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a chronic disorder with involuntary motor and vocal tics. Sleep problems are common due to increased tics and comorbid conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Medications to treat tics or insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness. A 14-year-old male presents with the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness of more than 1-year onset. He has a past medical history of Tourette syndrome, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and adenotonsillectomy due to recurrent pharyngitis. He is homeschooled, and sleeps between 10 pm to 6 – 10 am every day. Naps >2 h every day. Snoring, gasping and sleep talking are reported. His Epworth sleepiness score was 24. He denied hallucinations or cataplexy. He denied alcohol/drug abuse, trauma, hospitalization or family history of narcolepsy. Physical exam was unremarkable except BMI 35.29 kg/m2. His differential included obstructive sleep apnea vs. narcolepsy. His extended release guanfacine to treat tics was stopped, and Neurology held off starting an antidepressant for the sleep studies. The in-lab polysomnography showed an Apnea-Hypopnea Index = 0.6/h, Total Sleep Time = 7.8 h, Sleep Latency = 1 min, REM Latency = 47.5 min, Sleep Efficiency = 85%, and Periodic Limb Movement Index = 0/h. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test showed a Mean Sleep Latency in 5 naps = 7 min and Sleep-onset REMs = 3, meeting criteria for narcolepsy. Anti-streptolysin O was less than 200 IU/mL. Guanfacine was switched to nights to reduce daytime sleepiness. Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was started at 5 mg BID due to palpitations and slowly increased to 20 mg extended release in the morning and 10 mg immediate release in the afternoon. Modafinil has also been added, and both sleepiness and tics are under control. This case reminds us that among other sleep related problems, narcolepsy can coexist in Tourette syndrome. It’s interesting that both conditions share an impaired hypothalamus‐hypophysis axis but are not commonly linked together. Management is a concern as stimulants can cause tics. We consider medically appropriate to assess and study their sleep problems and treating with stimulants when necessary to improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The development of respiratory failure is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders that involve the respiratory muscles. However, the high incidence of sleep-related breathing problems in this population is less well known. In patients with neuromuscular disease, nocturnal breathing abnormalities frequently precede respiratory failure during wakefulness by months or even years. These nocturnal breathing problems are caused by multiple factors, including diaphragm and upper airway muscle weakness, scoliosis, obesity, and central respiratory control problems. Advances in the understanding of the links between sleep-disordered breathing and the development of daytime dysfunction and respiratory failure has revolutionized the management of these individuals. Mask positive pressure therapy is now available to improve both quality of life and longevity for these individuals. The lack of correlation between daytime testing and the severity of nocturnal breathing abnormalities makes it difficult to predict the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Further, patients may not always be aware of symptoms associated with sleep-disordered breathing, even if specifically questioned. However, simple bedside measurements of vital capacity and inspiratory muscle strength can provide useful guides for when nocturnal respiratory monitoring is indicated.",

Primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnoea and movement disorders, are also common. Management should be specific to the problem. Attention to underlying factors and sleep hygiene, as well as reassurance and education about age-related sleep changes, will often be sufficient. Hypnotics, which usually offer only temporary symptomatic relief, may be counterproductive, and should be prescribed only in the short term, except in limited specific cases. Short-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam or oxazepam), or possibly zopiclone, are currently the drugs of choice.",

      "title": "Severe Hot Flashes Are Associated With Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Because hot flashes can occur during the night, their presence has been frequently associated with insomnia in women with symptoms of menopause. However, many factors other than hot flashes or menopause can be responsible for insomnia, and several factors associated with insomnia in the general population are also commonly observed in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who have hot flashes. <h3>Methods</h3> A random sample of 3243 subjects (aged ≥18 years) representative of the California population was interviewed by telephone. Included were 982 women aged 35 to 65 years. Women were divided into 3 groups according to menopausal status: premenopause (57.2%), perimenopause (22.3%), and postmenopause (20.5%). Hot flashes were counted if they were present for at least 3 days per week during the last month and were classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to their effect on daily functioning. Chronic insomnia was defined as global sleep dissatisfaction, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, for at least 6 months. Diagnoses of insomnia were assessed according to the<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>, classification. <h3>Results</h3> Prevalence of hot flashes was 12.5% in premenopause, 79.0% in perimenopause, and 39.3% in postmenopause. Prevalence of chronic insomnia was reported as 36.5% in premenopause, 56.6% in perimenopause, and 50.7% in postmenopause (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Prevalence of symptoms of chronic insomnia increased with the severity of hot flashes, reaching more than 80% in perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women who had severe hot flashes. In multivariate analyses, severe hot flashes were significantly associated with symptoms and a diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Poor health, chronic pain, and sleep apnea were other significant factors associated with chronic insomnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Severe hot flashes are strongly associated with chronic insomnia in midlife women. The presence of hot flashes should be systematically investigated in women with insomnia. Treating hot flashes could improve sleep quality and minimize the deleterious consequences of chronic insomnia.",

The paralysis is consistent with atonia observed during normal REMPs produced by hyperpolarization of the spinal motoneurons originating in cholinoceptive neurons in dorsolateral regions of the pontine reticular formation. Estimates of RISP prevalence vary dramatically, yielding estimates between 6% and 40%. Sleep paralysis is often considered as a sleep-onset problem under the assumption that episodes occur at the beginning of the sleep period during Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP). Multiphase sleep-wake schedule (MPS) regimes likely produce high level of cognitive arousal precipitating episodes by increasing potential for waking during immediate post-interruption REMPs. Vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations likely arise via interactions between subcortical and cortical vestibular centers.

      "abstract": "Sleep comprises one third of human life and is very important for maintaining healthy mental and physical states. Sleep disorders disturbing normal sleep are very common and may induce serious consequences. Sleep disorder medicine is based on the concept of two different states (waking and sleep) of the human brain. The problems of the waking conscious state affect sleep and problems during sleep also affect daytime mental and physical activities. The common symp-toms of patients with sleep disorders are excessive daytime sleepiness, a decrease in alertness, and fatigue. To detect sleep disorders, we should understand the physiology of normal sleep. Normal sleep consists of non-rapid eye movement (75% to 80%) and rapid eye movement (20% to 25%) sleep. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders second edition lists 77 different sleep disorders divided into 8 categories. Clinical approaches to sleep disorder patients should include detailed history taking including sleep history, a sleep questionnaire, sleep diary, physical examination including the nasal/oral cavities and airway, and neurological/psychological examination. The common sleep disorders are obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. We should learn the characteristic clinical features of each sleep disorder and how to detect and treat them. We need a more active effort to educate physicians about sleep disorder medicine and should try large sample, long-term, and prospective studiesto reveal the pathophysiology and enhance the treatment of sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are common, serious, and treatable. However, most patients with sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and not treated appropriately due to lack of knowledge of sleep disorder medicine. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea should focus more attention on and provide more support for timely diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.",

Insomnia increases particularly as women approach and pass through menopause (7–10). Insomnia in postmenopausal women, part of the climacteric syndrome, can occur, on the one hand, in association with hormonal changes (11,12); on the other hand, women are more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders, such as major depression and anxiety disorders, which are also correlated with insomnia (5,13). Organic sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) resulting from a decrease of sex hormones in menopause may play an important role as well (14).",

      "title": "Parasomnias and Movement Disorders of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

      "title": "Daytime functioning and quality of life in chronic insomnia: a multi-method, multi-level approach",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is characterised by difficulties with initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Similar to most psychiatric and mental health conditions, insomnia is defined according to subjective complaint, and achieves disorder ‘status’ when associated daytime functioning impairment is present. Yet, ironically, it is these two cornerstones of insomnia disorder, combined, that have achieved relatively minimal attention in the literature. That is, perhaps surprisingly, the subjective experience, and impact of insomnia, at least from the patient (‘expert’) perspective, has been under-researched. Night-time symptoms and sleep parameters have typically been the target of both treatment and non-treatment (clinical, epidemiological, mechanistic) research.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, a multi-method, multi-level approach is adopted to better understand the daytime experience of those with chronically disturbed sleep. First, a brief overview (chapter one) of insomnia is provided to familiarise the reader with the ‘problem of insomnia’. A narrative review (chapter two) then sets the scene in relation to the assessment and measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and daytime functioning. This work reveals several inadequacies and limitations of existing work, and outlines a prospective research agenda. \r\n\r\nChapter three describes the first ever phenomenological study carried out in primary insomnia patients. Here, two qualitative methodologies, focus groups and audio-diaries, are combined to help better understand the proximal and distal impairments attributed to chronic sleep disturbance. Chapter four builds on this work by describing the creation of two new clinical scales, developed to quantify, in both valid and novel ways, the impact of poor sleep on aspects of daytime functioning and insomnia-related quality of life.\r\n\r\nChapter five combines the aforementioned qualitative and questionnaire approaches to explore the experience of an effective behavioural intervention for insomnia, sleep restriction therapy (SRT). The application of these refined methods provided insight into the effects of SRT on both sleep and daytime functioning, but also permitted exploration of treatment-related issues - such as adherence, side-effects, and mechanisms of action - that have otherwise been difficult to probe using traditional quantitative methodologies.\r\n\r\nChapter six tackles the issue of objective daytime impairment, typically assessed using computerised reaction time tasks. Through ‘mining’ an existing brain and behavioural database, and applying an algorithm to select poor and normal sleepers, it was possible to investigate cognitive functioning at two broad stages of processing – event-related potentials generated from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), and performance output using neuropsychological testing. The results provide some interesting hypotheses concerning possible cognition-arousal and -effort interactions. Importantly, as a by-product of this work, a methodological template for the future standardized assessment of brain and behavioural function in insomnia is considered.\r\n\r\nFinally, chapter seven synthesises the results of each preceding experimental chapter, with particular emphasis on how this work will advance research, measurement and understanding of insomnia-related functioning. Immediate clinical implications and relevance to other areas of insomnia research are also briefly considered.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "A relationship between neurovegetative symptoms and an increased risk of sudden infant death (SID) has been frequently described. Such symptoms are vomiting because of gastroesophageal reflux, breathing disorders while nutritive sucking, excessive sweating during sleep, prolonged apneas and apneas with associated symptoms, further unexplained episodes of cyanosis, pallor and loss of muscle tone. An acute decompensation of the cardiorespiratory autonomic system during sleep is currently discussed to be one of the causes of SID. Polysomnography investigations are used to diagnose sleep related cardiorespiratory autonomic dysfunction. In this study, infants up to the age of 5 months were examined using polysomnography throughout their entire nocturnal sleep. The findings from 79 infants with neurovegetative symptoms were compared with the results from 163 healthy control children. Indications of an impaired respiratory regulation during sleep were shown to be significantly more frequent in infants with neurovegetative symptoms. In particular the occurrence of periodic breathing with a high frequency of periodic apnea plus a large number of acute decreases in oxygen saturation could be shown in infants with neurovegetative symptoms. The findings were most pronounced during the first 1.5 months after birth. The results of this investigations lead to the conclusion that, in the case of young infants with breathing abnormalities, neurovegetative symptoms can frequently be observed. The occurrence of such symptoms should therefore be a reason for a polysomnographic examination.",

Many people might have experienced this type of passing sleep disruption, and it tends to resolve without any treatment. Chronic insomnia is disrupted sleep that occurs at least three nights per week and lasts at least three months. Chronic insomnia disorders can have many causes. Insomnia results due to an imbalance between sleep inducing neurotransmitters.

      "title": "Las suprarrenales en la hipoxia o anoxia",
      "abstract": "La disminución de tensión de oxígeno (hipoxia) es una situación de emergencia que somete el organismo a un esfuerzo (stress), el cual provoca múltiples modificaciones, algunas específicas o sea debidas a la disminución de oxígeno y otras generales, como ser el síndrome de adaptación. Si el animal sobrevive se observa una evolución de los fenómenos en tres fases: a) aguda o reacción de alarma; b) de adaptación o aclimatación; c ) de desadaptación o desaclimatación o descompensación. El sistema nervioso, estimulado inicialmente por la hipoxia, modifica la función de la corteza y la médula suprarrenal. La acción sobre la corteza se debe a que la acción nerviosa central provoca un aumento de la secreción de adrenocorticotrofina por la pars distalis de la hipófisis. La acción sobre la médula suprarrenal consiste en un estímulo sobre los centros simpáticos superiores (hipotálamo, etc.), que siguiendo la médula espinal y los nervios esplácnicos mayores y menores produce una fuerte descarga de adrenalina. Si la hipoxia es intensa o se provoca la asfixia, la descarga de adrenalina es una de las más intensas que pueden observarse y dura varios minutos. La reacción inicial sobre la corteza se produce al través de la hipófisis y por lo tanto falta en animales hipofisoprivos. La descarga de adrenocorticotrofina produce: a) disminución del ácido ascórbico, colesterol y lípidos de la corteza; b) el aumento de secreción de hormonas corticoadrenales produce disminución del timo y tejido linfático (acción linfolítica); c ) en la sangre, linfopenia y eosinofilopenia; d) aumento de los hidratos de carbono del organismo, en especial el glucógeno hepático, en animales en ayuno expuestos a la hipoxia; e) aumento de excreción de nitrógeno durante dicho ayuno; f) aumento de excreción de los 17-cetoesteroides urinarios. Durante la fase de adaptación o aclimatación vuelven a aumentar las grasas y el colesterol y sube el peso de la suprarrenal. Durante esta adaptación o aclimatación, la hipoxia es mejor soportada y produce menor disminución del ácido ascórbico suprarrenal. El peso corporal que había disminuido vuelve a recuperarse. Varios autores han comprobado que las hormonas activas sobre el metabolismo de los hidratos de carbono producen aumento de resistencia a la hipoxia. No se produjo con el extracto que empleamos y en las condiciones que experimentamos. La suprarrenal parece desempeñar un papel en la resistencia a la hipoxia. Si ésta es permanente o se repite todos los días, se ha encontrado que las ratas suprarrenoprivas no la soportan. No comprobamos esto en la anoxia aguda de 2 horas, ya sea por el corto tiempo de nuestros experimentos o por la raza de ratas empleadas. Es fácil comprender que se adicionen los síntomas de shock producidos por la hipoxia con los que produce la insuficiencia suprarrenal. Es posible producir un aumento de resistencia de las ratas normales o aún suprarrenoprivas, sometiéndolas paulatinamente una vez por día, durante períodos cortos (2 horas) a depresiones cada día mayores. En la hipoxia intensa permanente y prolongada o bien repetida diariamente durante períodos largos, se ha podido comprobar a la larga una pérdida de la adaptación. Se ha observado que reaparecen: la depleción de lípidos en la corteza, la disminución de resistencia a la hipoxia, la hipoglucemia, una tendencia a la temperatura subnormal. etc. En resumen: la hipoxia produce un aumento de actividad del sistema hipofiso-corticosuprarrenal y también, si es intensa, provoca una descarga de adrenalina de la médula suprarrenal por intermedio del mecanismo simpático-méduloadrenal. La presencia de la función suprarrenal favorece la resistencia del organismo durante la hipoxia, como sucede en todos los casos de emergencia. El aumento de las funciones cortical y medular puede cooperar con los demás mecanismos de resistencia del organismo, en una proporción que es difícil de precisar cuantitativamente.",

Patients with severe sleep apnea and objective insomnia have fewer nightmares. Dreams from all sleep stages include negative content. Sleep-onset hallucinations and the deep-sleep parasomnias, especially night terrors, can be remarkably bizarre, including dream content that parodies that of the classic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-associated nightmare. Nightmares are often reported by individuals who score abnormally on psychological tests as well as on screening tests for the diagnoses of insomnia, depression, neuroticism, schizotypy, psychosis, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The theoretical perspective that nightmares reflect a functional failure in emotional processing also supports the pathological role for nightmares. The Sundance studies indicated that individual's success in their creative roles report a higher frequency of nightmares and are more likely to use them in their creative process.",

These events encompass abnormal sleep related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Parasomnias are classified as: 1) disorders of arousal (from non-rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep); 2) parasomnias usually associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and 3) other parasomnias. This sleep disorders in childhood are common, and often more frequent than in adults. Clinicians should be aware that many pediatric parasomnias have benign and self-limited nature. Most of the parasomnias may not persist into late childhood or adolescence. Parasomnias in adults often differ in type from childhood parasomnias and may portend significant psychiatric disturbances or neurodegenerative disorders. A reliable diagnosis can often be made from a detailed history from the patient and, if possible, the parents or bed partner.

It varies from simple snoring up to severe stridor which appears mainly during sleep. The cause of all respiratory disorders depends on obstruction, vibration or both. We can also find respiratory disorders in some rare cases like Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome or Multisystem Disease. The respiratory events start with simple snoring without symptoms of dyspnea or hypopnea. It may extend to arousals due to respiratory efforts (RERAs Syndrome).\r\n\r\n\tWith more and more distress, the hypopnea (decrease in Oxygen) appears till complete apnea occurs with awakened stridor. The most common sequence of events in sleep respiratory disorders can be summarized into the following; simple snoring which leads to the increase in upper airway resistance and finally ending in a group of syndromes like OSAS (Apnea, Hypopnea, RERAs). In another sequence, snoring leads to Uvular Oedema which feels like morning Obstructive Sleep Hypopnea Apnea Syndrome (ObSHAS). This leads to increase in Arterial Hypertension which causes daytime sleepiness.\r\n\r\n\tThere are a lot of complications in OSAS which maybe local complications in mouse, nose and chest, or CVS complications like Erythema or Hypertension or psychological problems like dizziness or loss of consciousness or daytime sleepiness.\r\n\r\n\tOne of the most common problems is how to exactly detect the size and site of the obstruction of air flow.

The clinical spectrum of ROHHAD is broad, but sleep/wake disorders have received relatively little attention so far, although the central hypothalamic dysfunction would make the occurrence of sleep symptoms likely. In this case report, we expand the phenotype of ROHHAD with a number of striking sleep symptoms that together can be classified as a secondary form of narcolepsy. We present a 7-year-old girl with ROHHAD who displayed the classic features of narcolepsy with cataplexy: excessive daytime sleepiness with daytime naps, visual hallucinations, and partial cataplexy reflected in intermittent loss of facial muscle tone. Nocturnal polysomnography revealed sleep fragmentation and a sleep-onset REM period characteristic for narcolepsy. The diagnosis was confirmed by showing an absence of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We discuss potential pathophysiological implications as well as symptomatic treatment options.",

Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disruption has a profound impact both on an individual and on a societal level. The etiology of sleep disorders is often multifactorial: biologicsocialand psychological factors play a role. This is especially true for insomniawhich is the most common sleep disorder in different populationsincluding patients on dialysis. Biochemical and metabolic changeslifestyle factorsdepressionanxietyand other underlying sleep disorders can all have an effect on the development and persistence of sleep disruptionleading to chronic insomnia. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleepor having nonrestorative sleep. It is also associated with daytime consequencessuch as sleepiness and fatigueand impaired daytime functioning. In most casesthe diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient's historybut in some patients objective assessment of sleep pattern may be necessary. Optimally the treatment of insomnia involves the combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases acute insomnia resolves spontaneouslybut if left untreatedit may lead to chronic sleep problems. The treatment of chronic insomnia is often challenging. There are only a few studies specifically addressing the management of this sleep disorder in patients with chronic renal disease. Considering the polypharmacy and altered metabolism in this patient populationtreatment trials are clearly needed. This article reviews the diagnosis of sleep disorders with a focus on insomnia in patients on dialysis.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of parasomnias occurring in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Disorders of arousal are characterized by dissociated sleep, with wake and sleep phenomena intermingling, and local sleep, in which different areas of the brain exist simultaneously in different states of wakefulness or sleep. The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "abstract": "Drivers' sleepiness and falling asleep while driving account for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents (studies show different results from 1% to 30%). Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

These events often involve bizarre and unusual behaviors, and can challenge even the most ardent sleep specialist or epileptologist. Although some events are uncommon, 3% of adults and 20% of children may have recurring nocturnal behaviors. Many of these events are passed off as little more than frivolous episodes. Yet, nocturnal events may provide important clues to sleep and neurological function. The diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal events can be difficult because of the frequent overlap of clinical descriptions and lack of diurnal findings. Patients may not follow the ''classical'' patterns of parasomnia or epilepsy, and some patients may have parasomnias provoked by other sleep disturbances or seizures. Thus, the diagnosis of these patients often requires intensive investigation and extensive neurophysiological monitoring.",

      "title": "Maternal Depression, Mothering and Child Development",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "title": "Factors Affecting Sleep and Wakefulness in People with Epilepsy: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

Rules for improving the quality of sleep have evolved which can be quite useful to those with transient and milder forms of insomnia. Complaints about inadequate sleep are much more significant when the patient also complains of tiredness when awake. Caffeinated beverages and cigarette smoking may impair the initiation of sleep. Alcohol will interrupt sleep, inducing difficulty maintaining sleep. Sleep-related seizure disorders may prove quite difficult to identify but produce symptoms of nocturnal awakening, reducing sleep efficiency. Nonrestorative sleep suggests a difference in the distribution of sleep staging, implying an altered arousal threshold. Total sleep time appears to be within normal limits, but the patient complains of lack of satisfaction with his night's sleep.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

Respiration during wakefulness is influenced by not only automatic control but also voluntary and behavioral control. Sleep is associated with definite changes in respiratory function. With the onset of sleep, voluntary control of ventilation that overrides automatic control during wakefulness becomes terminated. Also ventilatory response to various stimuli including hypoxemia and hypercapnia is decreased. With these reasons respiration during sleep becomes fragile and unstable so that marked hypoxemia can be happened in patients with lung disease especially during REM sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea may also be developed if upper airway resistance is increased in addition to these blunted ventilatory responses.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history.

Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%).

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

      "title": "Practical Consequences of Fatigue-Related Performance Failures",
      "abstract": "THE FACT THAT TIRED PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WELL-RESTED PEOPLE DO IS A TRUISM THAT HAS BEEN LONG CONFIRMED BY CAREFUL EMPIRIC study in the laboratory.1 What is less obvious is the way in which fatigue manifests itself in performance changes. At one extreme, the fatigued subject may be in a microsleep (or, indeed, full sleep), in which case there will be a missed or tardy response. Such effects are often best detected by measuring lapses (unduly slow responses), for example, in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. This was shown nicely in a study of repeated sleep restriction,2 in which the number of lapses increased as the week of restricted sleep progressed. However, even without microsleeps, there can be a general slowing in information-processing speed.3 Others4 have argued that sleep loss results in a loss of cognitive creativity, as indicated by a tendency to use old information processing strategies, even though they are no longer optimal or even practical. Certainly, from all viewpoints, the more extreme (and/or chronic) the sleep loss and the longer and more boring the task, the more likely performance decrements are to occur.5\r\n\r\nIn most real-world situations, the worst consequences of fatigue result not from a response slowing from 200 milliseconds to 750 milliseconds, for example, but from a major cognitive or attention failure—something many in the field refer to as a loss of situational awareness.6,7 This loss manifests itself in the operator no longer responding appropriately, or perhaps even responding completely inappropriately, to the situation. Thus, in hindsight, it is clear to the individual concerned that an error was made or that an important feature of the situation was missed. Sometimes this loss of situational awareness results in a catastrophe such as Three Mile Island or Exxon Valdez8; at other times, the situation is saved by additional levels of safety control, resulting in only a near miss. A recent (4/10/2007) public letter from Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to Marion Blakely, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and to the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATC) union gives a useful insight into such real-world examples. The letter discusses one recent catastrophe and four recent near misses in the field of commercial aviation that may have resulted from a loss of situational awareness related to fatigue. It also gives the sleep community a compelling case for continuing their public campaign against chronic sleep loss and in furthering the study of the performance consequences of such loss. The full text of the letter is available on the NTSB public website at http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_30_32.pdf.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, NTSB Chairman Rosenker expressed concern about accidents and near misses perhaps attributable to ATC personnel working while fatigued. He noted that the NTSB had long been concerned with the effects of fatigue in persons involved in critical functions and the dangers to safety that arose as a consequence. He also documented the large number of suggestions that the NTSB had made to the FAA over the years with the aim of improving the situation and noted that few of them appeared to have been acted upon. In the beginning of his letter, Chairman Rosenker discussed a recent (8/27/2006) fatal air crash at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe airplane had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) for takeoff on runway 22, which is 7,003 feet long and equipped with high-intensity runway lights; however, the crew mistakenly taxied onto runway 26, which is 3,500 feet long and unlighted, and attempted to take off. The airplane ran off the end of runway 26, impacted the airport perimeter fence and trees, and crashed. Of the 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board the airplane, 49 were killed, and one received serious injuries… During its ongoing investigation of this accident, the Safety Board has learned that the air traffic controller who cleared the accident airplane for takeoff had worked a shift from 0630 to 1430 the day before the accident, then returned 9 hours later to work the accident shift from 2330 until the time of the accident at 0607 the next morning. The controller stated that his only sleep in the 24 hours before the accident was a 2-hour nap the previous afternoon between these 2 shifts.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB chairman also gave four examples of near misses from Chicago (3/23/2006), Los Angeles (8/19/2004), Denver (9/25/2001), and Seattle (7/8/2001), all potentially involving fatigued ATCs. In all four cases, a loss of situational awareness may have been to blame. In three cases, the ATC put two planes on a collision course on the same runway; in the fourth, the controller failed to notice that the pilot had selected the wrong runway (which was closed for repair). Here is the Los Angeles example.\r\n\r\nA controller cleared a Boeing 737 passenger airplane to taxi onto and take off from runway 24L at the same time that another passenger airplane, a Boeing 747, had been cleared to land on the same runway and was on a short final approach. The pilots in the landing airplane saw the 737 taxi onto the runway and discontinued their approach about 12 seconds before the impending collision would have occurred, passing approximately 200 feet above the 737 during the go-around. The investigation determined that when the controller began working the local control position, he received a correct position-relief briefing that the 747 was approaching runway 24L. The controller later indicated that he subsequently developed a mistaken belief that the 747 was landing on the adjacent parallel runway 24R. The investigation determined that the controller had worked a shift the previous evening from 1530 until 2330, then went home and slept between 5 and 6 hours before returning to work the incident shift, which began at 0730. The controller described the portion of his shift before the incident as a “hard day” and attributed his error, in part, to fatigue.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may concern shift work and overtime, both of which can have a potentially negative impact on the amount of sleep obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that all 5 incidents occurred immediately after a short return, i.e., a break of only 9 hours between the end of one shift and the start of another. Short returns have been cited as the major problem with regard to backward (phase advance) rotating shifts.9 Such issues can often be worsened by a shortage of qualified personnel to fill positions and an aging workforce. Many in the FAA undoubtedly care deeply about the ATC fatigue issue, and there has been some FAA research activity in this regard and have been a few attempts at employee education. However, as the NTSB letter notes, “The findings that controllers have minimal recollection of the FAA's previously disseminated fatigue-related information and poor awareness of fatigue-related issues and that they inconsistently apply personal strategies for maximizing restorative sleep suggest that safety could be improved by providing more intensive training to controllers on shift-work and fatigue-related issues.”\r\n\r\nThe examples given in the NTSB letter reinforce the need for the sleep community to continue to study the issue of insufficient sleep leading to a loss of situational awareness, even though such experiments may be difficult to design and execute. The NTSB letter also suggests a useful roadmap by which elected officials, the FAA, their employees, other government agencies and the traveling public can be better educated regarding the negative consequences of fatigue and the various ways in which such negative consequences can be ameliorated or avoided. The sleep community is ideally suited to take an active role in this endeavor by ensuring the development and implementation of scientifically accurate education and outreach tools.",

      "title": "0817 Conquering Two Sleep Birds with One Iron stone: The Case of Resolved Restless Sleep Disorder and Parasomnia with Iron Therapy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Restless Sleep Disorder (RSD) is characterized by frequent nocturnal movements of large muscle groups or a complaint of restless sleep by observers with associated daytime dysfunction.1 RSD, like other movement disorders of sleep, is associated with low iron stores.2 Children with RSD have increased NREM sleep instability and a propensity for parasomnia.2 No reports to date have demonstrated the use of iron therapy for parasomnia in patients with RSD. Furthermore, studies are limited in very young children with this disorder as they currently fall outside proposed diagnostic criteria.1 Report of Cases: A 2 year-old male presented to the sleep clinic with parental complaints of nightly sleep initiation and maintenance difficulty, mild snoring, restless sleep, episodes of sleepwalking and night terrors multiple times per week. Symptoms worsened over 6 months and were associated with daytime irritability and behavioral problems. Sleep quality measures assessed progress between visits: the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS SD) and Sleep Related Impairment (PROMIS SRI). Serum ferritin was initially 20ug/L. Polysmnogram demonstrated no significant sleep related breathing disorder, a large muscle group movement index of 14, periodic limb movement index of 3. Initial treatment included oral iron therapy, scheduled awakenings, and hypnotic dose melatonin. The sleep psychologist addressed limit setting and negative sleep associations with improved insomnia symptoms but parasomnia and restless sleep continued. The parent noted reduction in both movements and parasomnia frequency after one month of iron therapy. After a 3 month period on treatment, the parent reported complete cessation of the parasomnia, drastic reduction in restlessness, and near resolution of insomnia. Sleep quality measure PROMIS SD improved by 11, demonstrating reduced sleep disturbance. PROMIS SRI did not change. Ferritin level increased to 47ug/L. Conclusion RSD in a very young child with NREM parasomnia responded to oral iron therapy improving overall sleep quality. This case demonstrates the relationship between relative iron deficiency, RSD and associated parasomnia. Support (If Any) 1. DelRosso LM, Ferri R, Allen RP, et al.

This review examines the classification, etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment options for nocturnal enuresis. The condition is classified as either monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic, and primary or secondary, with primary enuresis accounting for 80% of cases. The pathophysiology involves three main mechanisms: nocturnal polyuria, high arousal threshold, and bladder dysfunction. Genetic factors play a significant role, with a strong familial component following an autosomal dominant pattern. Evaluation includes detailed medical history, voiding diary, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. Treatment approaches are divided into non-pharmacological (including behavioral modifications, motivational therapy, and alarm therapy) and pharmacological interventions (primarily desmopressin, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinergic drugs). While alarm therapy shows the highest long-term success rates (65-75%), combination therapy may be necessary for treatment-resistant cases. This review emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment approaches and family support in managing childhood nocturnal enuresis effectively.",

They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity.

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "title": "Is Pulmonary Hypertension Common in Uncomplicated OSA?",
      "abstract": "Accessible online at: www.karger.com/journals/res Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its clinical counterpart, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), encompass the pathophysiology of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The defining event for OSA is an unstable upper airway leading to flow limitation (hypopnea) or complete obstruction (apnea). The working definition of OSAHS for clinical research is restless sleep, includes disruptive snoring, and daytime sleepiness (including fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and inattention); both are to be accompanied by more than 5 events (apneas and/or hypopneas) during sleep [1]. Some efforts are being made to refocus working definitions for OSAHS away from counting only respiratory events to the describing appearance of arousals from sleep as the events that lead to daytime sleepiness/fatigue/inattention and even hypertension [2]. Here the literature seems to point to arousals as being as an important factor determining changes in blood pressure during sleep [3], but the effects on daytime (wakefulness) cardiovascular function are, in animal models, quite modest [4]. What about hypoxemia? There is a debate concerning the necessity and implications for working definitions of an apnea or hypopnea to include a fall in oxygen saturation as a defining criterion for apnea or hypopnea [5]. The fall in oxygen saturation that is a consequence of an apnea or hypopnea represents the sum total of pre-event gas exchange and event length and type [6]. In the case of an individual with a normal alveolar-arterial gradient, the fall in oxygen saturation may not be very great despite a considerable fall in PaO2; in contrast, a person who is hypoxic during the day will have a greater fall in oxygen saturation for a similar change in PaO2 with sleep onset or sleep apnea. In any event episodic changes in oxygenation can be quantified [7] and experimentally correlated with triggering sustained changes in blood pressure, increases in pulmonary artery pressure and up-regulation of systems than have long-lasting effects on cardiovascular homeostasis [8]. Therefore, episodic hypoxemia appears important. The report in this issue of Respiration by Alchanatis et al. [9] has a focus on pulmonary hypertension as a feature of uncomplicated OSA. One notable feature is its design. First, there is case control in regard to estimated pulmonary artery pressures in the presence or absence of sleep apnea in people matched for age, BMI and (normal) lung function. (OSAHS was higher.) Second, there was demonstrated an acceptable correlation between direct measurements and the noninvasive estimates of pulmonary artery measurements. Third, there was a good follow-up of the patients. Those with OSA and pulmonary artery pressures 120 mm Hg (the defining event for pulmonary hypertension in this report) were older, heavier, and had a slightly lower (but normal) PaO2 during wakefulness. Their finding indicates that pulmonary hypertension can occur in patients without overt cardiopulmonary problems.",

Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

      "title": "Pharmacologic Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders are commonly associated with sleep disturbances including insomnia, hypersomnia, and nightmares. Based on shared neurobiological mechanisms, a bidirectional link exists between sleep disturbances and depressive disorders. Presence of sleep disturbance is not only associated with increased depression severity but also portends a poorer prognosis with increased suicide risk in patients with depressive disorders. Polysomnographic findings such as reduced slow-wave sleep, decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency and increased REM density are associated with major depression. Comorbid primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and circadian rhythm disorders not only increase the risk but also complicate the treatment of major depression. It is imperative to comprehensively assess and treat sleep disturbances, either due to depression or due to co-existing primary sleep disorders, to optimize remission, prevent relapse, and reduce the risk of suicide in patients with depressive disorders. Medications, chronotherapies, and behavioral approaches alone or in combination may prove to be effective in treating sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders; however, more research is warranted in this area to determine the optimal management strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, a promising treatment for management of insomnia comorbid with major depression, needs wider implementation and more research to establish its efficacy in preventing suicide.",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

A 25-day trial is discussed here. 18 endogenous depressives who proved to be refractory to tricyclic antidepressive therapy were treated with periodic sleep deprivation (5 sleep deprivation treatments in the second half of the night at 5-day intervals) under continued drug therapy. The combined treatment led to a better result than would have been expected from drug therapy alone. Some of the sleep deprivation treatments effected an accelerated remission without the efficacy of treatment subsiding. In individual cases recovery occurred after one or a few partial sleep deprivation sessions. Whether in other respects sleep deprivation shortens the course of depressive phases is still unproven.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social jetlag (SJ) occurs when sleep-timing irregularities from social or occupational demands conflict with endogenous sleep–wake rhythms. SJ is associated with evening chronotype and poor mental health, but mechanisms supporting this link remain unknown. Impaired ability to retrieve extinction memory is an emotion regulatory deficit observed in some psychiatric illnesses. Thus, SJ-dependent extinction memory deficits may provide a mechanism for poor mental health. To test this, healthy male college students completed 7–9 nights of actigraphy, sleep questionnaires, and a fear conditioning and extinction protocol. As expected, greater SJ, but not total sleep time discrepancy, was associated with poorer extinction memory. Unexpectedly, greater SJ was associated with a tendency toward morning rather than evening chronotype. These findings suggest that deficient extinction memory represents a potential mechanism linking SJ to psychopathology and that SJ is particularly problematic for college students with a greater tendency toward a morning chronotype.",

He simply confuses the matter by gratuitously suggesting that an alarm system has to be either off or maximally on. Clearly many physiological alarm systems produce mounting discomfort and activation but do not lead to a full-fledged maximum reaction unless adaptive action has failed to be effective. Ley obscures the issue by a physiologically unwarranted dictum about how alarm systems work. Central sleep apnea is a pathological feature of the breathing control mechanism; patients with central sleep apnea breathe insufficiently except during full wakefulness. Such patients are quite similar to patients with the Ondine curse, so this does not contradict my views. In obstructive sleep apnea, obesity or upper airway narrowing may result in hypoxia and hypercapnia, which may induce central apnea. During sleep apnea, the usual response",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that makes it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep, or return to sleep after waking up too early. As a result, a person may wake up feeling unrefreshed and fatigued. This condition can lower the energy levels and impact ones mood. The amount of sleep needed varies for each person, but most adults require between 7 and 9 hours per night. Many adults experience short-term insomnia at some point, lasting for days or weeks. However, some individuals suffer from long-term insomnia, known as chronic insomnia. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), insomnia is more than just difficulty sleeping—it reflects an imbalance between Yin and Yang, the opposing forces that regulate the body's natural rhythms. Yin, which symbolizes coolness, nourishment, and rest, dominates the night, while Yang, linked to warmth, energy, and alertness, governs the day. When this balance is disrupted, the body has trouble shifting between wakefulness and rest, resulting in sleep disturbances. In this research paper is about eighteen years old girl who suffer from insomnia around 6 months. She is a high school student, and she goes to school in shifts. She uses melatonin as a therapy for this problem, and another health problem she has is an allergy to flowers and grass. When she came to our center for TCM, she slept for 3-5 hours and usually fell asleep in the early morning hours around 5-6 am. So far, he has had a total of 16 acupuncture treatments. The first 9 treatments were done more frequently, every second or third day, and then when the situation improved, she continued with the treatments once a week. After acupuncture treatments, the patient feels better, she sleeps 5-6 hours at night and also sleeps during the day. When she is on the second shift at school, she sleeps up to 8-9 hours at night. Acupuncture is often used as a treatment for insomnia and gives positive results.",

We report a case of recurrent falls in an elderly woman, occurring exclusively at night and caused by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. In this condition there is a loss of the normal atonia of postural muscles that usually occurs in REM sleep [2]. It results in complex, vigorous, dream-enacting behaviours during REM sleep [3]. These typical behaviours have the potential to cause serious injury at night, particularly from falls. This disorder appears to have been overlooked in the geriatric literature as a potential source of falls and injury at night.",

Fibrositis patients had more alpha EEG sleep and less REM and Stage 1 sleep. They were better able to recall their behaviourally signalled awakenings the following morning and reported qualitatively less satisfying sleep than the normal controls. The alpha EEG sleep anomaly may reflect a vigilant arousal state during nocturnal sleep and result in the daytime experience of unrefreshing sleep, psychologic distress, that re-enforces the perpetuation of the sleep-related symptoms.",

Les mouvements anormaux, pathologiques ou non, au cours du sommeil peuvent prendre differents aspects. Il peut s’agir de mouvements simples isoles ou survenant en salves non rythmiques comme les myoclonies d’endormissement ou les myoclonies propriospinales ; de mouvements simples mais survenant de facon repetee rythmique et periodique, comme les rythmies du sommeil de l’enfant, le bruxisme ou les mouvements periodiques de jambes ; ou de mouvements complexes comme dans le somnambulisme, les troubles du comportement en sommeil paradoxal ou l’epilepsie nocturne.L’interrogatoire du patient, mais surtout d’un temoin de son sommeil, permettra d’orienter le diagnostic en caracterisant le type de mouvement.

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining.

      "abstract": "L'enuresi primitiva (essenziale notturna) può essere definita come una minzione involontaria che avviene di notte durante il sonno, mentre nel corso della giornata la minzione è normalmente controllata, ed ha perciò caratteri peculiari. Il notare, a volte, nei bambini affetti da enuresi primitiva la concomitanza di piccoli disturbi psichici o emozionali, di piccolo male, di stati di ipervagotonia o spasmofilia, conferma la natura funzionale complessa dell'affezione, sulla quale influiscono in prevalenza turbe della vita psichica o degli interessi affettivi del bambino. Alcuni dei fattori psichici implicati nell'enuresi (mancinismo, infantilismo nei giochi o discorsi, terrori notturni, fobie) possono anche essere considerati come indice di una incompleta maturazione psichica. Non vogliamo qui discutere sull'etiopatogenesi della malattia, che è tuttora piuttosto oscura. La maggioranza degli autori considera l'enuresi primitiva come un disturbo funzionale complesso, non legato ad alterazioni dell'innervazione o della maturazione delle strutture nervose e muscolari preposte alla funzione vescicale, ma piuttosto riportabile ad alterazioni (o ritardo) del meccanismo volontario della minzione. Si parla di enuresi primitiva quando il controllo anche notturno della minzione non è stato raggiunto entro i primi tre anni di vita. Secondo Harrison (1967), a 5 anni l'enuresi è presente nel 15% dei maschi e nel 10% delle femmine, a 9 anni nel 5%. Il disturbo cessa spontaneamente alla pubertà in quasi tutti i casi.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

This group of parasomnias is composed of three disorders occurring essentially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep paralysis is one of the main symptoms associated with narcolepsy, but it can also occur individually. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by a loss of generalized skeletal muscle REM-related atonia and the presence of physical dreamenactment. Polysomnographic recordings of individuals with RBD showed a reduction of the tonic phenomena of REM sleep and the activation of the phasic phenomena. Parasomnias are frequent in the general population; more than 30% of individuals experiences at least one type of parasomnia. At the genetic level, there is growing evidence that many parasomnias have a genetic component.",

Typical sleep duration has reportedly declined over the past half-century or so, probably due to the myriad changes in work and lifestyle that have emerged with our increased reliance on electronic technology. This is problematic, as sleep is critical to so many of our cognitive functions and health. Sleep facilitates memory consolidation, emotional regulation, decision-making and judgment and maintains normal levels of alertness and focus throughout the day. In addition to its effects on cognitive functions, sleep is important for many aspects of physical health and brain repair. During sleep, the brain rids itself of neurotoxins increases the number of brain repairing oligodendrocytes and replenishes depleted energy reserves. Without adequate sleep, people are prone to a host of health related problems, including inflammation, weight gain, and high blood pressure. But while it is easy to point out the problems associated with disrupted or curtailed sleep, it is much less clear how to intervene to improve people’s sleep-wake cycles. Can anything be done to get us back on track?",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness. Sleep in TBI represents something of a challenge to investigate because of the broad array of possible diagnoses for the manifested problems.",

Developmental stammering, regardless of country or language, affects one per cent of adult populations. Exacerbation by the stress of adult conversation or public speaking contrasts sharply with normal flow during singing, acting or conversation with children. Alterations in regional cerebral blood flow suggest that there are underlying differences in sensorimotor function in developmental stammerers whose symptoms commonly appear during the period of intensive language acquisition around the third and fourth year. Emotional tensions may exacerbate the disturbance, but equally psychological growth is adversely affected by the handicap. Abnormal motor control is confirmed by the exaggerated activity in the right hemisphere. The normal sequence of articulatory programming and motor preparation for single word reading is reversed. Absence of activation over the left auditory cortex supports the notion of impaired or diminished auditory feedback in the self-monitoring of speech seen in normal brains. Subcortical abnormalities are a feature of both developmental and acquired stammering.",

We aimed to review the association between, and medical management of, narcolepsy and psychosis in children and adults.We reviewed the full text of 100 papers from 187 identified by a PubMed search on narcolepsy plus any of these keywords: psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, side effects, safety, and bipolar disorder.Three relevant groups are described. (i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes.

Cefalea por uso excesivo de medicamentos: implicaciones clinicas y terapeuticas . Acta Neurol Colomb 2010;26:195-201). SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

      "abstract": "Ring (20) chromosome epilepsy syndrome is characterized by highly refractory epilepsy that is often associated with non-pathognomonic, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Seizures typically begin during the stage of childhood around the age of 6 years. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is the most common seizure types and is distinguished by a long-lasting, confusional state that is often associated with EEG patterns in the form of prolonged, high-voltage slow waves with occasional spike/sharp components. Patients with this syndrome suffer from intractable seizures with cognitive decline and frequent epileptic episodes. Accompanying features of this rare disorder, such as superficial minor dysmorphic abnormalities if any, mental retardation and behavioral changes are quite variable. Because of the variability in clinical presentation, in particular the lack of clear dysmorphic features, the clinical diagnosis of this disorder can be delayed before being diagnosed genetically. Most patients with this syndrome have chromosomal changes in the form of a mosaic. High levels of mosaicism correlate well with a lower age of onset and severe cognitive impairment. Here, we emphasize the importance of early G-banding chromosomal analysis when patients present with unexplainable severe seizures and repetitive NCSE, even in the absence of any dysmorphic features suggestive of a chromosomal disorder.",

We report that another previously described abnormality of REM sleep, REM sleep behavior disorder, may also be a symptom of narcolepsy. This disorder was found in 10 narcoleptic patients during routine clinical evaluations involving polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests. During REM sleep, 7 additional narcoleptic patients displayed persistent muscle tone and/or excessive twitching, which we believe to be subclinical components of REM sleep behavior disorder. These 17 patients, diagnosed by established criteria for narcolepsy and for REM sleep behavior disorder, ranged in age from 8 to 74 years. Seventy-one percent were male. Narcolepsy and REM sleep behavior disorder most commonly emerged in tandem.

      "title": "Nocturia. A rarely recognized symptom of sleep apnea and other occult sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, awakening from sleep to urinate, is a common symptom in a variety of medical disorders and in the elderly. Awakening from sleep as a result of nocturia is thought to be secondary to a sensation of urinary urgency resulting from an overextended bladder. Nocturia-related awakenings cause significant sleep disruption and fatigue in elderly patients and are correlated with an increased number of falls at night. Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are also common in the elderly and are frequently the source of awakenings from sleep. The high incidence of both nocturia and sleep disorders in the elderly and other groups of patients suggests that sleep disorders may be the source of some awakenings from sleep usually attributed by patients to nocturia. Nocturia secondary to sleep disorders would be causatively different from nocturia secondary to pressure to urinate in common medical disorders and would require different diagnostic procedures and treatment.To determine the frequency of nocturia as a symptom of primary sleep disorders.Eighty consecutive patients, 27 women and 53 men with a mean (+/-SD) age of 58.7+/-14.1 years, undergoing polysomnography (sleep study or PSG) for the evaluation of a suspected sleep disorder and who met the sole criteria of awakening from sleep at least once and urinating voluntarily. Each patient had either a standard PSG recording or a PSG with administration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Immediately after each episode of nocturia during the PSG, patients were questioned about the reason they believed they had awakened. The PSG record immediately before awakening from sleep was then reviewed for potential causes of awakening. Patients were also asked on final morning awakening to fill in a questionnaire regarding their awakenings during the prior night. Patient reports were compared with the PSG to determine the accuracy of subjective reports.Patients awakened from sleep and voluntarily urinated a mean (+/- of 1.5+/-0.75 times per night for a total of 121 awakenings for the group. The majority (79.3%) of these awakenings from sleep were found to be directly secondary to sleep apnea, snoring or periodic leg movements in sleep. Patients correctly identified the source of their awakening from sleep on only five(4.9%) occasions and only once was sleep apnea correctly cited by a patient as a source of awakening during the night.Most awakenings from sleep attributed by our patients to pressure to urinate were instead a result of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The fact that patients do urinate once awake likely contributed to faulty post hoc reasoning and might have limited further inquiry by patients and their physicians in clinical settings into the actual sources of awakening from sleep. Even in those patients with well-known medical reasons for noctruria, Sleep disorders were still found to be the source of almost all awakenings from sleep. Patients were extremely poor judges of the reasons they awoke from sleep. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder should be seriously considered whenever a patient reports frequent awakenings from sleep to urinate.",

Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings. Since sleep pathology can negatively impact cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functions, assessment and treatment of the underlying sleep disorders may positively impact a patient's health and quality of life.",

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in Headache and Migraine",
      "abstract": "Headache and sleep disorders are prevalent, comorbid conditions that challenge physical as well as psychosocial well-being. Headache is the most common pain-related complaint and the seventh leading ailment seen in medical practice, accounting for 18 million physician visits annually in the USA alone (1). Though historically headache often has been trivialized (perhaps because pain is not easily quantified and headache does not generally compromise life expectancy), headache is in a major quality of life (QOL) concern. In fact, migraine headache is among the 20 leading causes of \"years lived with disability\" according the World Health Report (2). The burden of headache is increasingly appreciated in psychological, family and interpersonal, vocational, and economic realms. Headache, particularly in its more chronic and severe forms, has been linked to sleep disorders. Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are varied in nature, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. General symptom patterns, particularly morning headache and chronic daily headache, are suggestive of and aid in recognition of a sleep disorder. Management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache; sleep-disordered breathing is the most empirically supported example of this relationship. Although pure sleep-related headaches, such as hypoxemia-related headache, are less prevalent and more easily recognized, primary headaches as well are often impacted to some degree by sleep. Irrespective of sleep disorders, variation in the sleep/wake schedule is one of the most common acute headache precipitants while sleeping is one of the most common palliative responses to headache. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Despite an emerging literature supporting the interdependence of sleep and headache, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains speculative. Few well-controlled studies are available, and it is difficult to generalize results across sleep and headache literatures due to inconsistencies in diagnostic nosologies, lack of standardized outcome measures, and varied populations. Future research with improved methods is needed to identify mediating factors between sleep and headache. This chapter reviews the co-morbidity of headache and sleep disorders, prevalence, diagnostic considerations, societal and individual burden of headache, clinical implications, and considerations for future directions.",

Pre-eclampsia is characterized by new onset hypertension (sitting blood pressure ≥140/90), proteinuria (≥2+ in a random urine sample or ≥300 mg in a 24-h collection) with or without non-dependent edema after 20 weeks' gestation. Eclampsia was at one time thought to be the end result of pre-eclampsia, hence the nomenclature. It is now clear, however, that seizures are but one clinical manifestation of “severe” pre-eclampsia. Other manifestations include, among others, HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), renal failure, hepatocellular damage, pancreatitis, congestive cardiac failure, pulmonary edema and fetal intrauterine growth restriction.",

Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.",

All-night polysomnographic recordings with video monitoring showed episodes of teeth grinding or clenching occurring exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which were often associated with movements of the hands and fingers and/or brief vocalization. Throughout REM sleep, there was excessive phasic chin electromyographic twitching, without increased tone, and also excessive phasic electromyographic twitching in multiple muscle sites. The patient maintained a normal nonrapid eye movement-REM cycle, but showed increased REM density. Polysomnographic characteristics suggested that there may be a common pathophysiology in a certain type of sleep bruxism and the REM sleep behavior disorder. Sleep bruxism seen in this case is concluded to be a manifestation of subclinical REM sleep behavior disorder.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

None of these patients reported other symptoms or presented sleep laboratory manifestations of narcolepsy or of breathing disorders during sleep. A diagnosis of restless leg syndrome, head trauma or a past history of psychopathology or infectious diseases known to cause EDS were also ruled out. In addition, none of the patients reported a history of drug or alcohol abuse, chronic sleep deprivation or irregular sleep-wake schedule and none were taking medications known to influence sleep at the time of the study. Results of the present study showed no correlation between PLMS index and poor sleep efficiency or daytime sleepiness as measured by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, a significant negative correlation was found between sleep efficiency at night and the mean sleep latency on the MSLT. These results suggest not only that PLMS and nocturnal sleep disruption are not the primary cause of EDS, but that these sleepy patients have a high propensity to sleep both at night and during the daytime. Therefore, the presence of PLMS during nocturnal sleep recording should not preclude the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are highly prevalent and diverse. The aetiology of some sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, is understood at the conceptual level of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and in part at a mechanistic level. Other disorders such as insomnia are more difficult to relate to sleep regulatory mechanisms or sleep physiology. To further our understanding of sleep-wake disorders and the potential of novel therapeutics, we discuss recent findings on the neurobiology of sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity and its relation with the subjective experience of sleep and the quality of wakefulness. Sleep continuity and to some extent REM sleep emerge as determinants of subjective sleep quality and waking performance. The effects of insufficient sleep primarily concern subjective and objective sleepiness as well as vigilant attention, whereas performance on higher cognitive functions appears to be better preserved albeit at the cost of increased effort. We discuss age-related, sex and other trait-like differences in sleep physiology and sleep need and compare the effects of existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep- and wake-promoting treatments. Successful non-pharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction for insomnia and light and melatonin treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders target processes such as sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Most pharmacological treatments of sleep disorders target specific signalling pathways with no well-established role in either sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Pharmacological sleep therapeutics induce changes in sleep structure and the sleep EEG which are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sleep- and wake-promoting therapeutics often induce residual effects on waking performance and sleep, respectively. The need for novel therapeutic approaches continues not at least because of the societal demand to sleep and be awake out of synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle, the high prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in mental health disorders and in neurodegeneration. Novel approaches, which will provide a more comprehensive description of sleep and allow for large-scale sleep and circadian physiology studies in the home environment, hold promise for continued improvement of therapeutics for disturbances of sleep, circadian rhythms and waking performance.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

Sleep impairments in children with AD are associated with increased risk of short stature, metabolic syndrome, mental illness and neurocognitive dysfunction. Although the association between AD and sleep disturbance is well established, the specific types of sleep disturbance in pediatric AD patients and their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A scoping literature review was performed to characterize and summarize the types of sleep disturbance in children (less than 18 years of age) with AD. 31 papers met inclusion criteria and extracted data were analyzed in an iterative manner. Two types of sleep disturbances were found to be more prevalent in pediatric AD patients in comparison to controls. One category was related to loss of sleep (increased frequency or duration of awakenings, increased sleep fragmentation, delayed sleep onset, decreased total sleep duration, and decreased sleep efficiency). Another category was associated with unusual behaviors during sleep (restlessness/limb movement/scratching, sleep-disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea and snoring, nightmares, nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal hyperhidrosis). Some mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances include pruritus and induced scratching and increased proinflammatory markers induced by sleep loss. Sleep disturbance appears to be associated with AD. We recommend clinicians to consider interventions that may reduce sleep disturbances in children with AD. Further investigation of these sleep disturbances is needed to elucidate pathophysiology, develop additional treatments, and reduce negative impacts on the health outcomes and quality of life in pediatric AD patients.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT An hypnotic should be used only when there is evidence of sleep disturbance. The wide range of sleep disorders (e.g. delayed sleep onset or problems of sleep maintenance) and the added complication that the patient may be involved subsequently in skilled work demand that the pharmacokinetics of various hypnotics must be understood before the correct hypnotic can be chosen. Impaired performance is more severe and persists far longer with compounds that are slowly eliminated and with the use of higher doses. The particular situations of aircrew and mountaineers have been studied in detail. Caution must be exercised in the management of aircrew coping with irregularity of rest and work. Temazepam has been used for aircrew for over 10 years and the absence of adverse effects ensures that it remains the recommended hypnotic in this area of medical practice. The relationship of insomnia with the hypoxic environment is undetermined. To investigate this, sleep was studied in six individuals during an expedition to the Himalayas. At altitude, temazepam led to less wakefulness and to drowsy sleep ‐ there were no prolonged sleep latencies.",

The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep.

To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "title": "Sympathetic activation by obstructive sleep apnea: a challenging ‘off-label’ meta-analysis",
      "abstract": "A single occurrence of obstructive apnea during sleep will trigger sequential hemodynamic, chemical and cortical perturbations that collectively elicit surges in central sympathetic outflow, neural norepinephrine release and blood pressure; these ebb once breathing resumes [1–3]. Left untreated over months or years, the cumulative burden of scores or hundreds of such events nightly elicits sustained autonomic after-effects, apparent during wakefulness [3]. Relative to healthy individuals, vagal heart rate modulation of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is reduced [4], their blood pressure variability is increased [4] and their muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is substantially greater than predicted by their age, sex, or body mass index (BMI) [3–6], with sympathetic firing incidence during quiet rest directly proportional to the frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI) [7], a conventional measure of OSA severity [8]. In a randomized trial in which continuous positive airway pressure abolished OSA, 1 month of treatment eliminated this daytime sympathetic excess [9]. This upward setting, by chronic untreated OSA, of MSNA during wakefulness has been attributed to long-term structural or functional neural adaptations to hypoxia and oxygen free radical generation evoked by recurring apneas and hypopneas during sleep. Such autonomic neuroplasticity involves both oxygen sensing components of the peripheral chemoreceptor and specific cortical and brain-stem regions participating in the generation or modulation of efferent vagal and sympathetic nerve discharge [10–17]. Peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity to hypoxia is augmented [10]. The left dorsal posterior insula thins, proportionate to hypoxia severity, whereas the left mid-cingulate cortex and both thalami thicken; the magnitude of such thickening correlates positively with MSNA burst incidence during wakefulness [17]. Current published literature concerning the MSNA of patients with OSA comprises case–control, mechanistic or interventional studies of relatively small cohort size. Many originate from the same laboratory, with each addressing a singular hypothesis. In a recent issue of the journal, Quarti-Trevano and colleagues [18] offered a systematic review and meta-analysis of such data, with three specific aims: to determine whether such daytime sympathetic activation coheres to OSA rather than concomitant co-morbidities also characterized by autonomic perturbations; if the magnitude of sympathetic activation is directly proportional to the AHI; and whether heart rate adds clinical value, as a surrogate to microneurography (essentially a research probe) as a signal of both sympathetic activation and OSA severity. Although the frequency and severity of apnea-induced hypoxia [19] and the frequency of arousal from sleep [20] are arguably more causal of chronic sympathetic excitation during wakefulness, the majority of microneurographic studies report only the AHI. Quarti-Trevano et al.[18] accomplished admirably all three aims, demonstrating: an incremental increase in daytime MSNA burst incidence with each grade of OSA severity; a significant positive correlation between MSNA and the AHI, independent of body weight or BMI; and direct significant correlations between heart rate and both MSNA and the AHI. They concluded that OSA is itself a state of chronic sympathetic activation, regardless of co-morbidities and therefore an appropriate target of interventions designed to restore autonomic equilibrium. These authors merit congratulation not only for establishing these concepts convincingly but in particular for their thoughtful subsequent management of the challenges encountered in the course of this endeavor [21]. Meta-analyses were initially designed, introduced to the clinical literature and adopted enthusiastically by practitioners because of their capacity to estimate effect sizes and confidence intervals of interventions evaluated in randomized controlled trials of cohort sizes that individually might have been insufficient to reject equipoise. Fundamental principles included the uniqueness of study participants and randomization, to minimize the influence of unknown but potentially important confounding variables. Later, non-randomized studies were introduced to meta-analyses, with the caveat that ensuing risk of bias was amplified and often inestimable. Quarti-Trevano et al.'s systematic review of the English language literature identified 16 pertinent cross-sectional studies, 7 prospective studies and 3 clinical trials, comprising 528 patients with sleep apnea and 268 healthy controls [18]. However, in the analysis and synthesis of such data, it transpired that these numbers were not singular. More often than not, the same patient and control data were presented in two or more studies (in once instance, the same 25 OSA patient data appeared in 5 publications concerning different mechanistic hypotheses; Vaughan Macefield, personal communication) – but the authors had no means of establishing such precisely and, accordingly, eliminating each redundant entry. To lessen the likelihood of duplication, they then excluded 12 of the 26 first-pass articles [21]. According to their Table S4 [21], if one sums the number of participants reported for each, the revisited meta-analysis comprises 365 OSA patients and 165 controls. But are all data in this smaller pool derived from unique individuals? Since several laboratories were represented by more than one publication (often reporting rather similar cohort mean data), likely not. The magnitude of redundancy within this residue cannot be established without access to primary source participant-level data. According to Table S4 in their updated work [21], the mean MSNA burst incidence in those with OSA (mean AHI 36.2 events/h) was 63.6 bursts/100 heart beats whereas in the control group (age difference) (mean AHI stated to be 1 event/h) this was 45.8 bursts/100 heart beats. Assuming, as a thought experiment, that these group means are not weighted by double or triple counting of specific individuals’ data points, let us then ask: is this differential excess of ∼40% on average an overestimate, an underestimate, or a fair approximation of the magnitude of central upregulation of sympathetic outflow induced by months or years of quotidian cycles of apnea, hypoxia, hypercapnia, and arousal during sleep? Because the control group was on average 5.4 years younger, normative data concerning the influence of age on MSNA [6] would posit an overestimate. Also, at their average age, any overestimate would be augmented if there were disproportionately more women in the control population than in the OSA cohort [6]. Biffi et al.[21] identified participant sex in their review of primary sources, but did not report separately the net number of men and women represented by these 14 publications. Conversely, considering the positive linear relationship illustrated in the authors’ revisited Figure 5 [21], had these controls more than 1 apneic event/h on average, the impact of OSA might have been underestimated. Of the 14 studies compiled, approximately 1/4 reported no controls; 1/4 selected controls based on good health and the absence of symptoms suggestive of OSA; 1/4 performed polysomnography on all participants but did not report the actual AHIs of those classified as controls, and 1/4 performed polysomnography on all participants and reported the AHIs of all participants. In the latter, a surprising number of community-based volunteers who had no symptoms or foreknowledge of sleep apnea had mild, moderate, or even severe OSA. Thus, 2 studies from 1 laboratory reported, for controls, mean AHIs of 7 [22] and 8 [23] events/h and mean arousal indices of 21 [22] and 21 [23] events/h; 2 publications from our program (with considerable participant redundancy) reported, for controls, mean AHIs of 6 [7] and 8 events/h [20] and a mean arousal index of 20 events/h [20]. On the basis of this finding of non-zero AHI from healthy asymptomatic individuals from two independent laboratories, it is extremely unlikely that the AHI of all of the control subjects, whether polysomnography was not performed, or performed, but the findings not disclosed, was zero. If the mean AHIs of these control cohorts were indeed >0, then both meta-analyses [18,21] may have underestimated the true impact of OSA on MSNA. Importantly, the present data are specific to the resting state. Combining blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging and microneurography, our group detected no difference between individuals with no or mild OSA and with moderate or severe OSA [7] in the magnitudes of increases in BOLD signaling in cortical autonomic regions or in sympathetic nerve firing when obstructive apnea was simulated by a brief series of Muller maneuvers [24]. These considerations aside, the four key insights from this arduous scholarly effort are: OSA is a condition of sympathetic excess during wakefulness, regardless of patient co-morbidities; the magnitude of daytime sympathetic excitation is directly proportional to the frequency of apneas plus hypopneas during sleep; it should not be presumed, without validation by polysomnography, that lean individuals, self-reported as healthy, are without OSA; and, when assembling the findings of multiple studies from the same laboratory, addressing, appropriately, distinctly different questions, the high risk of aggregating data that do not originate from unique individuals should serve as a caution for those embarking on similar meta-analyses.

Sleep function is closely related to the Sleep Cycle, containing two main parts: rapid eye movement (REM), which is also named active sleep; and no rapid eye movement (NREM), which is defined as deep sleep. The first REM period may be less than 10 minutes in duration, while the last one may exceed 60 minutes. Awakening after a full night’s sleep is usually from REM sleep. The sleep pattern changes as the child grows. Polycyclic sleep pattern of the newborn changes to a monocyclic adult pattern. In newborns, the total sleep duration can be 14 to 16 hours, in a day of 24 hours. According to the Cleveland Clinic, lack of sleep can result in short – term and long – term problems. Short – term problems include lack of alertness, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired memory and stress, whereas longitude lack of sleep can result in high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in depressed patients resembles sleep in normal subjects whose circadian rhythms of temperature and rapid-eye-movement sleep are phase-advanced (shifted earlier) relative to their sleep schedules. If this analogy is relevant to the pathophysiology of depressive illness, advancing the time of sleep and awakening should temporarily compensate for the abnormal timing of depressed patients' circadian rhythms. Four of seven manic-depressive patients studied longitudinally spontaneously advanced their times of awakening (activity onset) as they emerged from the depressive phase of their illness. In a phase-shift experiment, a depressed manic-depressive woman was twice brought out of depression for 2 weeks by advancing her sleep period so that she went to sleep and arose 6 hours earlier than usual. The antidepressant effect of the procedure was temporary and similar in duration to circadian desynchronization induced by jet lag in healthy subjects. This result supports the hypothesis that abnormalities of sleep patterns in some types of depression are due to abnormal internal phase relationships of circadian rhythms.",

      "title": "Waking up to the importance of sleeping well for cardiovascular health",
      "abstract": "The potentially adverse impact of poor sleep quality, insomnia, and other sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been the subject of increasing exploration over the past decade. Obstructive sleep apnea has been the most extensively studied sleep disorder in relation to hypertension, and is thought to be causally related through mechanisms including heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and vascular endothelial dysfunction that are triggered by sleep-disordered breathing.1 A growing body of research evidence has also revealed relationships between insomnia and CVD. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and is defined by subjective reports of difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking too early.2 With insomnia, both sleep quality and duration are often impaired. Although a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be based on self-report alone, objectively assessed insomnia features using polysomnography reveals longer sleep onset latency, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and prolonged periods of wakefulness during the sleep period relative to normal sleepers.3 Observational studies employing objective sleep measures show that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have CVD, even after controlling for comorbid sleep disorders, and other potentially confounding comorbidities.4 Short sleep duration has also been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, higher blood pressure (BP), metabolic syndrome, greater coronary calcification, and higher levels of stress hormones.5 An important pathway through which sleep may affect CVD risk is through its relationship with BP, with substantial support for an association between insomnia and incident hypertension.6, 7 For example, in a prospective study of 786 men and women from the Penn State Cohort, those with chronic insomnia, determined by polysomnographic study and subjective reports of sleep problems persisting for over a year, were at over twice the risk of developing hypertension over a 7.5-year follow-up period. Furthermore, chronic insomnia coupled with short sleep duration (<6 hours) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of developing hypertension.8 Other studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, have reported similar observations, reinforcing the perspective that insomnia, when coupled with short sleep duration, may be especially hazardous in terms of its association with hypertension and CVD.9-11 Poor sleep quality is a widespread problem, commonly reported by patients with a variety of medical and mental health conditions,12, 13 as well as among those with diagnosed sleep disorders. However, the potentially broad impact of poor self-reported sleep quality on CVD risk has received relatively little attention. In the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Lo and colleagues report14 an informative meta-analysis examining the association between subjective sleep quality and BP. The authors include data from studies based on over 45 000 participants spanning five continents and provide formal analyses of studies that assessed subjective sleep quality using the well-established and validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.15, 16 Their analyses showed that poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher BP and an increased likelihood of hypertension. The impact of poor sleep quality is perhaps likely to be most conspicuously reflected in BP during the nighttime sleep period. Ambulatory BP monitoring studies have established that BP typically exhibits a circadian rhythm characterized by a fall in pressure during the nighttime sleep period. Relative to daytime pressure, a nighttime dip in BP of ≥10% is considered normal and individuals with this level of BP dipping are referred to as BP dippers, whereas a nighttime BP dip of <10% describes nondippers.17 Lo and colleagues found that in the subset of studies in their meta-analysis, which used both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ambulatory BP monitoring, BP dippers were characterized by better sleep quality than nondippers. Other studies, using subjective as well as objective measures of sleep quality derived from polysomnography and actigraphy, also have shown poor sleep quality to be associated with a blunting of the normal nighttime dip in BP.18-22 The nondipping circadian BP profile is associated with target organ damage, including cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease23, 24 and is a strong prognostic indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for both patients with and those without hypertension.23, 25-28 This evidence underscores the importance of BP measured during the nighttime sleep period, reflecting its greater prognostic significance than clinic BP, or ambulatory BP assessed during the daytime.29 Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms accounting for blunted nighttime BP dipping and elevated nighttime BP are not well understood.30 Sympathetic nervous system activity normally shows a substantial decline from daytime waking activities to nighttime sleep, but the magnitude of this decline is attenuated in the context of a nondipping nighttime BP profile.21, 31, 32 Heightened nighttime sympathetic nervous system activity would favor peripheral vascular constriction, resulting in abnormally elevated systemic vascular resistance during the sleep period.33 The contribution of vascular disease to a blunted nighttime BP dip is supported by observations that a nondipping circadian BP profile is approximately twice as common in patients with coronary heart disease compared with age-matched healthy controls.34, 35 Blunted BP dipping has also been associated with impaired vascular endothelial function in women with untreated hypertension.35 As might be anticipated, in a study of men and women with hypertension, the hemodynamic mechanism related to a nondipping BP profile was a failure for systemic vascular resistance to show a normal decline during the nighttime sleep period.37 In view of the well-established pathophysiologic significance of elevated systemic vascular resistance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension,38 coupled with the prognostic significance of elevated nighttime BP, it is not difficult to appreciate the potential importance that sleep quality may have in the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease. The available evidence therefore clearly implicates poor sleep quality and insomnia as risk factors in the cause of hypertension. It also suggests that in the context of high BP and hypertension, poor sleep quality may exacerbate hypertension by promoting target organ damage and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the critical question of whether poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and CVD remains unanswered. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement calling for research aimed at better understanding the association between sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia with CVD.39 Despite the wealth of available evidence, it is almost all observational, and the existence of a causal relationship between insomnia and CVD remains conjecture rather than inference. However, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. In a pilot study of 22 adults with high BP, who slept <7 h/d, 13 were randomized to a 6-week intervention designed to extend the sleep period and 9 to a control condition.40 Those in the sleep-extension group showed a postintervention increase in sleep duration of 35 minutes following the intervention, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 24-hour BP, whereas no significant changes occurred in the control group. We now need more well-designed randomized controlled trials to test the broad hypothesis that improving sleep quality in individuals with insomnia or subjectively reported sleep problems will reduce the risk of developing hypertension, as well as help control BP in those with hypertension, ultimately reducing the risk of adverse clinical events. Examining the effects of pharmacological treatments to improve sleep would be of interest, but interventions using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia may be especially informative. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is safe and effective and is the current gold standard for insomnia treatment.41 Therefore, it is ideally suited for intervention trials in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension and/or other medical and psychiatric comorbidities. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",

Understanding the physiology and pattern of normal sleep is an important foundation for interpreting the clinical symptoms, signs, and neurophysiological abnormalities observed in patients with sleep disorders. The term polysomnography refers to the simultaneous recording of multiple sleep parameters, including a limited electroencephalogram, respiratory parameters, chest excursion, limb movements, and the electrocardiogram. Polysomnography is important for assessing a variety of sleep disturbances, including disorders such as sleep-related breathing disorders (including obstructive sleep apnea), rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and periodic movements of sleep. The multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test are studies that are especially useful in the evaluation of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias.",

Factors influencing the increased risk of hearing loss relate, for example, to abortion, older age, too frequent exposure to noise. Hearing loss usually occurs gradually. Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object. It is important to check the hearing in newborns in order to react in time to possible irregularities. Symptoms of deafness in a child occur in the form of non-response to sounds and lack of interest in musical toys. Children between the ages of 8 and 12 months will not respond to their name in case of hearing loss, and the absence of speech is possible",

      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

The two overall epilepsy types are generalized and focal. Focal epilepsy most commonly indicates a focal brain injury like traumatic brain injury or tumor. In contrast, generalized epilepsy is due to a genetic etiology, not necessarily inherited. An epilepsy diagnosis is clinically made and can be supported by typical EEG and MRI findings. Nearly 4% of people develop epilepsy, with the largest peak during later years and the second peak during childhood. Nearly 70% of people are seizure-free after five years, whether via control with medications or, less commonly, the epilepsy itself remits. Life expectancy for epilepsy patients is lower. A key contributor to epilepsy mortality is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Uncontrolled generalized tonic clonic seizures are a key risk factor for SUDEP.",

The parasomnias comprise different entities such as nightmares, REM-sleep behavior disorder, sleep enuresis, and bruxism. Diagnosis and treatment often require a multidisciplinary approach. Virtually every psychiatric, neurologic, or medical disease, when of sufficient severity, leaves its specific fingerprint on sleep; some disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or epilepsy, tend to be exacerbated during sleep.

      "abstract": "Up to 50–65% of patients with cirrhosis exhibit interrupted night sleep, delayed sleep habits and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to disease complications (i.e. ascites, pruritus), hepatic encephalopathy or impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. In addition, use of common hypnotics is contraindicated in these patients because of impaired hepatic disposition and increased cerebral sensitivity to psychoactive medication. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep history, so that the need to sleep increases in parallel with the duration of the wake period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-h rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show considerable delays in the 24-h melatonin rhythm, mostly in relation to impaired sensitivity to light cues. However, while circadian abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not offer a comprehensive explanation to the sleep–wake changes exhibited by these patients. Limited data are available on homeostatic sleep control in patients with cirrhosis, which is worthy of further study.",

      "title": "REM Sleep Instability – A New Pathway for Insomnia?",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia afflicts approximately 10% of the adult population and is associated with daytime impairments and an elevated risk for developing somatic and mental disorders. Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.",

Nightmare disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM behavior disorder (RBD), and status dissociatus (agrypnia excitata) are some of the REM parasomnias. Parasomnia overlap syndrome is a term used for parasomnias that occur in both REM and NREM sleep stages, such as catathrenia. RBD is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep stage and is characterized by acting out dreams (oneirism), leading to unwanted motor actions such as kicking, punching, or slapping, or sudden abrupt movements that can cause unexplained injuries to self or bedpartner. Memory of the associated dream is usually preserved. Diagnosis is obtained via video polysomnography with findings of REM activity without atonia and video recording of the oneirism. Treatment starts with developing a safety plan, improving sleep hygiene, and identifying any medications or other triggers such as snoring or leg movements. Melatonin, benzodiazepines, and a few other medications are used for treatment of RBD and other REM parasomnias. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2021;51(12):560–565.]",

When a recording is made of an electroencephalogram (EEG) and other physiological variables such as muscle activity and eye movements during sleep (a technique called polysomnography) a pattern of sleep consisting of five different stages emerges. This pattern varies from person to person, but usually consists of four or five cycles of quiet sleep alternating with paradoxical (active) sleep, with longer periods of paradoxical sleep in the latter half of the night. A representation of these various stages over time is known as a hypnogram, and one of these derived from a normal control subject is shown in Figure 1. The quiet sleep is divided further into four stages, each with a characteristic EEG appearance, with progressive relaxation of the muscles and slower, more regular breathing as the deeper stages are reached. Most sleep in these deeper stages occurs in the first half of the night.",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

      "title": "Sleep and Sleep-Wake Manipulations in Bipolar Depression",
      "abstract": "In the last 30 years, it has been convincingly demonstrated that sleep in major depression is characterized by disturbances of sleep continuity, a reduction of slow wave sleep, a disinhibition of REM sleep including a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period) and an increase in REM density. Furthermore, manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle like total or partial sleep deprivation or phase advance of the sleep period have been proven to be effective therapeutic strategies for patients with unipolar depression. The database concerning sleep and sleep-wake manipulations in bipolar disorder in comparison is not yet as extensive. Studies investigating sleep in bipolar depression suggest that during the depressed phase sleep shows the same stigmata as in unipolar depression. During the hypomanic or manic phase, sleep is even more curtailed, though subjectively not experienced as disturbing by the patients. REM sleep disinhibition is present as well. An important issue is the question, whether sleep-wake manipulations can also be applied in patients with bipolar depression. Work by others and our own studies indicate that sleep deprivation and a phase advance of the sleep period can be used to treat bipolar patients during the depressed phase. The risk of a switch into hypomania or mania does not seem to be more pronounced than the risk with typical pharmacological antidepressant treatment. For patients with mania, sleep deprivation is not an adequate treatment--in contrast, treatment strategies aiming at stabilizing a regular sleep-wake schedule are indicated.",

Generally, people suffering from this condition complain bitterly, and sincerely, of not being able to sleep at all, yet when studied show sleep of normal duration and quality. Pathophysiology of paradoxical insomnia remains largely poorly understood. Increase in faster EEG activity during sleep and increase in physiological arousal seem to be prevalent in these patients, but whether they have direct causative impact remains to be seen.

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome affects mainly obese individuals and it is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index of five or more episodes per hour associated with daytime somnolence. In addition to anatomical factors and neuromuscular and genetic factors, sleep disorders are also involved in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Obesity affects upper airway anatomy because of fat deposition and metabolic activity of adipose tissue. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and metabolic syndrome have several characteristics such as visceral obesity, hypertension and insulin resistance. Inflammatory cytokines might be related to the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and metabolic syndrome. Sleep apnea treatment includes obesity treatment, use of equipment such as continuous positive airway pressure, drug therapy and surgical procedures in selected patients. Currently, there is no specific drug therapy available with proven efficacy for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Body-weight reduction results in improvement of sleep apnea, and obesity treatment must be emphasized, including lifestyle changes, anti-obesity drugs and bariatric surgery.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome presents with neuromuscular, autonomic, and mental status changes. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

Inadequate sleep, either in duration or quality, and altered sleep-wake cycles are common reports in palliative care. The causes for insomnia in palliative care may be related to psychological factors (anxiety or depression), pain, treatment-related toxicity, or other comorbid medical conditions. Untreated insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability, depressive or anxious mood, and accidents. Assessment, prevention, and management are addressed. The chapter includes discussion regarding sleep hygiene, the role of exercise, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

      "title": "Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders and Cardiac Arrhythmia",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a range of conditions characterized by abnormalities in the frequency and/or depth of breathing during sleep. Cessations in breathing rhythm (apneas) are momentary and often cyclical, while reductions in breath amplitude (hypopneas) may be momentary or sustained (Dempsey et al., 2010). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome (HS), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, central sleep apnea (CSA), upper airway resistance syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are the primary sleep-related respiratory disorders. Although CSA is accompanied by alterations in neural input, the obstruction characteristic of OSA, the most common form of SDB, is also neurally mediated (Veasey, 2009). Intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep characteristic of OSA result from collapse of the upper airway. The concomitant disruption of normal ventilation and sleep architecture is typically associated with snoring, repeated arousals from sleep, and daytime sleepiness (Bradley & Floras, 2003; Lattimore et al, 2003; Quan & Gersh, 2004; Shamsuzzaman et al; 2003;). Prevalence studies indicate that SDB, and particularly OSA, are common problems worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. However, OSA is also considered to be largely undiagnosed (Young et al, 1993; Young et al, 2002; Lavie, 2007). In the United States, for example, the estimated proportions of adults with OSA who are not diagnosed range from 60% to 80%, with an even greater under diagnosis suspected for children (Carter III, 2008). The increasing prevalence can be intuitively associated with the global obesity epidemic; however, a reverse association has also been postulated based on emerging evidence that OSA promotes weight gain (Carter III, 2008). The clinical relevance of OSA was thought for years to be limited to what was considered a benign but often annoying manifestation as snoring, ranging to the possibly serious consequences of daytime sleepiness affecting cognitive function and work performance, mental state, and driving ability. OSA is now known to be a risk factor for other serious conditions, and has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Bradley & Floras, 2009; Devulapally et al., 2009; Lattimore et al, 2003; Lopez-Jiminez et al., 2008). Cardiac arrhythmias are common in OSA, and the potential link between tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and adverse outcomes in OSA patients continues to be an important area of research (Chan & Wilcox, 2010; Verrier & Josephson, 2009).

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

      "title": "Sleep Problems Among Infants and Young Children",
      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children9s sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at night for many hours or inability to have a sound sleep, which deprives one of natural rest and interferes with activities during the day. Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives. We’ve all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam, or an important deadline. Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis.

This rhythm usually escapes detection in the scalp EEG but is commonly seen over bone defects (\"breach rhythm\"). With the use of epidural electrodes, however, this rhythm becomes quite prominent and dominates the activity of the temporal lobe unless there is excessive local EEG abnormality and/or pathology. This temporal rhythm lies in the range of 6-11/sec and thus often extends into the theta frequency range. There is no proven blocking effect; this mere fact sets it apart from posterior alpha and Rolandic mu rhythm. It is essentially a rhythm of the waking state but may linger into drowsiness and even into light NREM sleep. It is also separable from the highly controversial frontotemporal \"kappa rhythm\" of bygone times. EEG recordings from the depth of the temporal lobe (limbic structures) do not demonstrate such a rhythm that is likely to originate from the neocortical portion. Its neurophysiological and psychophysiological significance is enigmatic.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

Sympathetic hyperactivity manifests with hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, hyperhidrosis, peripheral vasoconstriction, and hyperthermia or hypothermia.Massive sympathoexcitation can lead to intracranial hemorrhage, vasogenic brain edema, congestive heart failure, apical ballooning (Takotsubo) syndrome, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Less commonly, autonomic hyperactivity also involves the parasympathetic system and manifests primarily with bradyarrhythmia or even syncope. Common causes of autonomic hyperactivity are head trauma, hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome,and iatrogenic disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.Autonomic hyperactivity in the setting of cognitive, psychiatric or sleep disturbances suggests alcohol (or other depressant drug) withdrawal, fatal insomnia, or limbic encephalitis. Patients with autonomic hyperactivity should be managed in an intensive care unit as they require continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, respiration, and fluid balance.",

Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

L’association avec les troubles du sommeil est décrite chez 25 % à 50 % des enfants et chez plus de la moitié des adultes présentant un TDA/H. La question de cette comorbidité pose question. En effet, Il n’est pas clair à l’heure actuelle si les troubles du sommeil sont intrinsèques au TDA/H ou s’ils se produisent à la suite d’un trouble primaire du sommeil sous-jacent. En effet, il est décrit des symptômes de « type TDA/H » dans certains troubles du sommeil primaires tels que les troubles respiratoires du sommeil, les mouvements périodiques des membres pendant le sommeil et le syndrome des jambes sans repos. De plus, la somnolence diurne excessive (l’un des symptômes de la narcolepsie et l’hypersomnie idiopathique) peut « mimer » des symptômes de TDA/H. Dès lors, la similitude de certains symptômes peut conduire à des erreurs diagnostiques entre troubles primaires du sommeil et TDA/H. Ainsi, nous nous proposons lors de ce symposium de faire un point sur les liens entre troubles du sommeil et TDA/H chez l’adulte : – en effectuant tout d’abord une revue de la littérature explorant la comorbidité entre ces différents troubles. Puis en présentant ensuite deux études originales sur ce thème en population adulte : – explorant d’une part, la comorbidité des hypersomnies (hypersomnie idiopathique et narcolepsie) chez les adultes TDA/H et la comorbidité TDA/H chez des adultes hypersomniaques ; – d’autre part, en explorant la somnolence diurne excessive objective par un test de maintien de l’éveil en population adulte TDA/H et l’impact de cette somnolence sur les performances de conduite des sujets (sur simulateur de conduite).",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent sleep-related breathing disorder in children with a prevalence of approximately 3% between the ages of 3 and 8. Its origin is multifactorial (hypertrophy of pharyngeal soft tissues, narrowing of the bone airways, damage to the neuromuscular tone). The symptoms and clinical signs to look for during the day and at night are directly related to upper airway (UA) obstruction or poor sleep quality. After a complete anamnestic and clinical evaluation, including nasofibroscopy, the ENT specialist will refer to an adeno-amygdalectomy or night recording by polysomnography or polygraph to confirm the diagnosis in the child. Among adolescents, the prevalence of OSAS is reported to be between 0.5 and 6%. The main risk factors are obesity, male sex and a history of tonsillectomy. In addition to the classic symptoms of childhood OSAS, this syndrome may, in adolescents, manifest itself as a misleading semiology of dyssomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and/or mood disorders. Differential diagnoses with risk behaviours, phase delay or narcolepsy should be systematically discussed. It is essential to record breathing during sleep. Even if the obstructive apnea/hypopnea index is low, it must be considered. In both children and adolescents, multidisciplinary management (ENT, orthodontist, maxillofacial physiotherapist, pulmonologist) should be early in order to avoid neurocognitive, behavioural, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Maxillofacial surgery can be discussed from the age of 15. It is important not to forget to pay attention to the rules of healthy living and sleep as well as the management of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repeated periods of breathing cessation during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnoea is both common and underdiagnosed in the obese. A recent study found that as many as 86% of older obese type 2 diabetics had obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity is independently associated with developing obstructive sleep apnoea, and the reverse may also occur. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is therefore expected to rise in the wake of the obesity epidemic. The number of partial (hypopnoea) or complete (apnoea) airway obstructions per hour (apnoea-hypopnoea index) is used to classify obstructive sleep apnoea as mild (5-14 events per hour), moderate (15-30) or severe (>30). Severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with a two to sixfold increase in all-cause mortality; the impact of mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnoea is less clear. Until recently, the evidence supporting a beneficial effect of weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea has been limited by a lack of randomized trials. In 2009, at least three randomized controlled trials evaluated whether medically induced weight loss improves obstructive sleep apnoea. The treatment effect ranged from 42% to 62% improvement, although the highest estimate was seen in a very short duration study (9 weeks). Patients who either lost 10-15 kg or more, or had severe obstructive sleep apnoea at baseline, benefited most from treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged, self-sustained seizure that can manifest as a prolonged convulsion, subtle facial or limb twitching, or simply altered mental status, always in association with a persistent electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure pattern. In clinical trials, convulsive seizures lasting longer than 5 min are often treated as SE,1 whereas epidemiological studies have defined 30 min of continuous convulsive seizures or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness as SE.2 There are 126,000 to 195,000 episodes of SE associated with 22,000 to 42,000 deaths each year in the United States when SE is defined as 30 min of seizures.2 As many as 50% of patients older than 65 years of age who suffer from SE die within 30 days of the episode. Although mortality is far less common in younger patients, they are at risk for neurological morbidity, such as injury to the hippocampus3 and neuropsychological dysfunction.4 Prolonged seizures can also lead to significant systemic complications, including pulmonary congestion and edema, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, elevation of body temperature, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and rhabdomylosis. These systemic complications tend to worsen as more seizures occur.5 It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving condition.5,6 Ongoing seizures rapidly modify neuronal activity and synaptic function.7 This rapid neuronal plasticity is manifest in changes in behavioral seizures, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and evolution of neuronal injury and death. Although these changes are continuous, it is convenient to divide SE into stages for the purposes of investigation and treatment (Table 41–1).",

These disorders illustrate different control mechanisms involved in sleep and wakefulness, including those determining the prevalence and timing of NREM and REM activity, somatomotor inhibition and excitation, autonomic discharge, and the circadian framework of sleep. The genetic defect in narcolepsy has been localised to the short arm of chromosome 6, but the chromosomal localisations of the genetic basis for the other disorders are not known. Also, with the possible exception of acetylcholine, no definite neurotransmitter involved in any aspect of sleep regulation has been positively identified and the biochemical defect in narcolepsy is not known.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

However other conditions have shown to have presence of sleep on REM episodes which include but not limited to obstructive sleep apnea, sleep wake schedule disturbance, alcoholism, neurodegenerative disorders, depression and anxiety Report of Case Here we present a case of 30 year old female with history of asthma, patent foraman ovale, migraine headache, and anxiety who presented with daytime sleepiness, falling asleep while at work, occasional scheduled naps, non-restorative sleep, sleep paralysis, and hypnopompic hallucination. Pertinent physical exam included; mallampati score of 4/4, retrognathia, high arched hard palate, crowded posterior oropharynx. She had a score of 16 on Epworth sleepiness scale. Patient previously had multiple sleep latency test at outside facility which revealed 4/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency of 11.5 minutes. She however was diagnosed with narcolepsy and tried on modafinil which she failed to tolerate. She was tried on sertraline as well which was discontinued due to lack of benefit. She had repeat multiple sleep latency test work up which revealed 2/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency was 13.1 minutes. Her overnight polysomnogram prior to repeat MSLT showed SOREM with sleep onset latency of 10 minutes. Actigraphy showed consistent sleep pattern overall with sufficient sleep time but was taking hydroxyzine and herbal medication. Patient did not meet criteria for hypersomnolence disorder and sleep disordered breathing. Conclusion There is possibility her medication may have played pivotal role with her daytime symptoms. We also emphasize SOREMs can be present in other disorders such as anxiety in this case and not solely in narcolepsy",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy.

The features of posttraumatic headache may vary, but the most distressing type is the chronic daily headache. This study evaluates occurrence of chronic daily headache in relation to the intensity of head injury.All patients with head injury who were seen by the senior author (J.R.C.) in the Southern Illinois University Medical School (SIUMS) Neurology Clinic between 1980 and 1991 were identified from the SIUMS headache registry. Data on headache status before and after head injury was obtained, and patients with more than one headache per week before head injury were excluded. Each patient's headache status at the time of the clinic visit was classified as chronic daily headache (headache occurring at least 5 of 7 days for 6 months), intermittent migraine, or no headache. Head injury severity was graded by duration of loss of consciousness or amnesia as minimal (less than 5 minutes), mild (5 to 60 minutes), moderate (1 to 24 hours), or severe (more than 24 hours).There was an inverse relation between extent of head injury and occurrence of chronic daily headache. For minimal head injury (n = 54), 80% had chronic daily headache, and 11% had no headache, while for moderate/severe head injury (n = 23), only 27% had chronic daily headache, and 68% had no headache (P<.001, chi2).This study suggests that the risk of developing posttraumatic chronic daily headache is greater for less severe head injury compared with moderate/severe head injury. The reason for this relation is unclear.",

Sleep disorders affect all aspects of health, showing a bi-directionality with health conditions and comorbidity with several diseases. Consequently, sleep disorders may have severe negative consequences both for the individual and the enterprise, as well as for society on the whole, in terms of health, productivity and social costs. When considering the disturbances of the sleep/wake cycle, it is important to distinguish between those connected with endogenous biological factors from those related to socio-environmental conditions, including work, and those associated with mental and physical diseases, that are often associated and interact with each other. Many sleep disorders are still underestimated and under-valued in clinical practice and, to a much greater extent, in workers' health surveillance. The present paper is aimed at drawing the attention of the occupational health physician to some key issues, particularly regarding excessive daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift and night work, as well as their implications in terms of health and occupational consequences. Information on the main aspects of clinical diagnosis and health surveillance, as well as risk management and prevention at the workplace, are provided.",

      "title": "Insomnia and sleep state misperception: Clinical features, diagnosis, management and implications",
      "abstract": "Background Insomnia is a highly prevalent complaint, largely associated with mental disease. Clinical evidence classifies insomnia in 2 subtypes: with sleep misperception (WSM) and without sleep misperception (wSM). That presents distinctive pathophysiologic pathways and different public health implications. Objectives Describe the main differences between primary insomnia WSM and wSM regarding: – clinical features; – diagnosis; – management; – implications. Methods We conducted a systematic review. PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo were searched from 2000–2016. The reference lists of systematic reviews, narrative synthesis and some important articles were included. Following the inclusion criteria, we selected 25 studies from 59 articles. Results The prevalence of sleep-state misperception in primary insomniacs (total sleep time &gt; 6.5 h and sleep efficiency &gt; 85%) is around 26%. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a profile of high depression and anxiety and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder. Cortical hyperarousal is higher in insomniacs and could be related to an alteration in sleep protection mechanisms. The sleep architecture was relatively normal for the WSM comparing with the group wSM. Risk of cardiometabolic, neurocognitive morbidity and mortality, and responses to treatment are different between these two insomnia phenotypes. Patients with short sleep duration may respond better to biological treatments, whereas insomnia with normal sleep duration may respond primarily to psychological therapies. Conclusions The clinical characteristics of patients with sleep-state misperception differed from those without this condition. Available research related to these conditions is expanding rapidly, but many questions remain unanswered. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "abstract": "Excessive sleepiness occurs frequently in the general population and is a common feature of many psychiatric conditions. The reductions in quality of life associated with excessive sleepiness may be substantial, involving compromised cognitive performance and work productivity as well as possible harm to the individual and the public. Excessive sleepiness may be the result of a number of extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Although it is an established symptom of certain psychiatric illnesses, abnormal excessive sleepiness in psychiatric patients may be the result of a comorbid disorder of sleep or wakefulness. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sleep disorders are common in community psychiatric practices because clinicians may not be aware of the different causes and consequences of excessive sleepiness. It is essential to recognize and treat the underlying cause of this disorder. In cases where sleep disorders are suspected, a comprehensive treatment program might include nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacologic approaches, or both may need to be initiated to encompass the complexity of sleep disorder treatments. Careful monitoring and follow-up of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including counseling and long-term support, are essential to ensure treatment compliance and to maintain improvements over time.",

      "title": "The Effect of Insomnia Definitions, Terminology, and Classifications on Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short‐term (up to 3 weeks), and long‐term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative‐hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long‐lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive‐behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.",

The methods used for evaluating sleepiness are subjective measures or self-evaluations, performance decrease measures, sleep propensity measures, and arousal decrease measures. A clear and detailed history is important in differential diagnosis of sleepiness because symptoms of sleepiness may be expressed in terms of 'tiredness' or 'fatigue' that do not directly denote sleepiness. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is also invaluable because these symptoms may result from a variety of causes ranging from medical disorders to insufficient nocturnal sleep.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Describe a patient with Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) with rapid cycling of hypersomnia episodes and autonomic changes.\nBACKGROUND: KLS exists in the borderland between psychiatry and neurology. It is often misdiagnosed as depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis or seizures. It is estimated to be a rare disorder (1.5 cases per million population), typically in adolescent males and preceded by a triggering event, such as infections or head trauma.\nDESIGN/METHODS: We describe the case of a 14 yo boy with a previous history of childhood absence epilepsy, off medications for 1 year at presentation. A few days after an upper airway infection, he developed hypersomnia, sleeping over 15h/day. When awake, he exhibited bradyphrenia and altered perception, stating “things are not right, I feel as if I am not here”. Family reported dishinhibition, alternating hypo/hyperphagia and speaking in “baby talk” in a regressed fashion.\nSymptoms improved without specific treatment but he relapsed every 2-3 weeks, with cycles lasting 10-14 days each. Investigation included two lumbar punctures, with non-inflammatory results and negative bacterial/viral studies. Serological studies were unrevealing. Imaging was unremarkable. Long-term EEG was normal. Toxicology, thyroid function, vasculitis, paraneoplastic panel and autoimmune panel were all negative. B12, thiamine and folate were normal. Psychiatric evaluation did not elicit diagnostic criteria for mood, somatic or other mental health conditions.\nRESULTS: A repeat EEG showed intermittent delta slowing. Heart rate monitoring displayed alternating periods of bradycardia with tachycardia. HLA typing was positive for DQB1*0201 which has been reported in patients with KLS patients and may support autoimmune etiology. Symptoms were suggestive of KLS and he was started on modafinil with improved hypersomnia. He was tried on valproic acid and lithium for treatment of the rapid cycling of symptoms without improvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: KLS has significant morbidity if unrecognized. We review and discuss updated diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology and management. This case exemplifies an unusual rapid cycling pattern of hypersomnia episodes associated with classic KLS symptoms.

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Most psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, or neurotic disorders are associated with sleep disorders of various kinds, among which insomnia is most prevalent and important in psychiatric practice. Almost all patients suffering from major depression complain of insomnia. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia associated with major depression shortens the duration to achieve remission of depression. Insomnia has been recently reported to be a risk factor for depression. Hypersomnia is also a major sleep problem in patient suffering from depression. There have been no clinical guide to treat the symptoms of hypersomnia in depression, but some clinical trials treating them with NDRI or adjunctive administration of psychostimulants. In patients with schizophrenia, insomnia is often an early indicator of the aggravation of psychotic symptoms. Electroencephalographic sleep studies have also revealed sleep abnormalities characteristic to mood disorders, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. A shortened REM sleep latency has been regarded as a biological marker of depression. Reduced amount of deep Non-REM sleep has been reported to be correlated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, REM sleep abnormalities were found in teenagers having post-traumatic stress disorder after a boat accident. Although these facts indicate that insomnia plays an important role in the development of psychiatric disorders, there are few hypotheses explaining the cause and effect of insomnia in these disorders. Here, we reviewed recent articles on insomnia and hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders together with their clinical managements.",

      "title": "Sleep apnoea: from numbers to the people",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is defined as the presence of more than five events of complete obstruction (apnoea) or partial obstruction (hypopnoea) of the pharynx [apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) >5] per hour of sleep. Amongst adults, more than 24% of men and 9% of women suffer from OSA each night 1. When a patient with OSA presents daytime sleepiness that affects work or social activity, OSA syndrome is diagnosed. Almost all patients with OSA snore and experience unrefreshed sleep but tend not to consult their general practitioner (GP) regarding this symptomatology. In most cases, patients visit their doctor at the request of their partner who has observed cessation of breathing during sleep or inappropriate DS. Overall, OSA is underdiagnosed and therefore undertreated. Despite this, it is currently a very common cause of GP consultation. The high prevalence of OSA in the industrialized world is related to the increasing prevalence of its main risk factor: obesity. Excessive fat deposit in the pharynx reduces the diameter of the upper airway and favours its collapse during sleep, when the tone of the intrinsic muscles of the pharynx is reduced compared to wake time. The immediate health consequences of undiagnosed and untreated OSA, that is occupational or traffic accidents and reduced neurocognitive performance, are due to sleep deprivation. During the night, patients with OSA suffer intermittent hypoxaemia and acute autonomic arterial and haemodynamic changes. In the long term, these changes induce a permanent state of oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability and insulin resistance. Therefore it is not surprising that many epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between OSA and increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality 2-5 and, more recently, increased risk of neoplasms 6. In this issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine 7, Lamberts et al. used the nationwide database of the entire Danish population to evaluate the role of sleep apnoea and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on the incidence rate of stroke and the incidence rate of myocardial infarction (MI). Three main conclusions were presented by the authors: (i) a diagnosis of ‘sleep apnoea’ was associated with an increased risk of stroke and MI; (ii) this risk was especially significant for subjects under 50 years of age; and (iii) there was no reduction in the risk of stroke and MI, relative to the general population, in patients who had been prescribed CPAP. The Danish nationwide database has the advantage of including health data and follow-up of all citizens regardless of the type of medical care they receive. However, the information obtained depends only on diagnoses and treatments reported by the healthcare system. The authors acknowledge multiple limitations of such population studies to establish association between a specific disease and its health outcomes. In the case of sleep apnoea, there are other limitations that should be considered. According to Lamberts et al., less than 1% of the Danish population is diagnosed with ‘sleep apnoea’ and, because results of sleep studies were not presented, the proportion of patients with central sleep apnoea or OSA, or the severity of these conditions, is unknown. The use of the undiagnosed sleep apnoea population as a reference for establishing the risk of CV events is problematic as most Danish individuals with sleep apnoea that are not diagnosed and are in fact included in the ‘control group’ therefore sets a selection bias that underestimates the risk of developing health outcomes amongst subjects diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Amongst patients treated with CPAP, the degree of adherence to therapy (e.g. number of hours of use per day) is unknown. On the other hand, assuming that the range of severity of OSA obtained by the authors in the validation cohort is the same as in the general population, more than 48% and 89% of patients with mild and moderate OSA, respectively, are treated with CPAP in Denmark. It is not surprising that more than 30% of patients discontinue treatment as it is well known that patients with less severe OSA are less compliant with CPAP therapy. In other health systems, the indication for CPAP therapy is confined to patients with severe (AHI >30) or moderate OSA (AHI >15) with DS 8, 9. The health benefit of CPAP treatment appears to be limited to patients with severe OSA and with good adherence (>4 h of daily use) 2, 10. Finally, the authors compared the protective effect of CPAP therapy on CV morbidity in patients treated with CPAP and the general population, which includes subjects with undiagnosed sleep apnoea but mainly individuals without this disorder. Taken together, these limitations could have attenuated the differences in treatment effect on evaluated outcomes. In summary, the findings of Lamberts et al. support the common belief that OSA is an independent CV disease risk factor but do not exclude the possibility of a protective effect of CPAP therapy to eliminate this increased risk. The causal relationship between OSA and cardiovascular morbidity may be established only by large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted over a long period of time. Such studies are unlikely as CPAP therapy is so effective in patients with symptomatic OSA that for ethical reasons they cannot be denied this treatment. At present, there is strong evidence from RCTs of a causal relationship between OSA and markers of risk of CV events such as hypertension. In addition, in a recent RCT, it was found that in OSA without DS, patients with worse sleep apnoea and with CPAP adherence of <4 h/night showed a higher rate of incident hypertension or CV events compared to those who used CPAP for more than >4 h/night 10. Large RCTs are not always feasible. In addition to ethical and safety issues with regard to treatment allocation for OSA patients, RCTs require a long period of time in which clinical equipoise may exist, are expensive and have limited generalizability. In the meantime, good clinical and community-based studies, such as this study by Lamberts et al., can improve understanding about disease outcomes and therapy. The work of Lamberts et al., amongst other studies, confirms the importance of OSA as a global public health concern. It is unclear which patients with OSA are more likely to develop CV or metabolic disorders. It is possible that in addition to the severity of the disease, other factors such as sensitivity to intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation or epigenetic modifications in regulatory genes involved in accelerated atherosclerosis contribute to worsen the prognosis of patients with OSA 11. Meanwhilst, in the absence of widely accepted and validated guidelines, management of patients with suspected OSA should be based on minimum criteria such degree of daytime sleepiness evaluated by appropriated questionnaires and adequate examination of the upper airway, accurate diagnosis using validated sleep studies and discussion with the patient of the best available therapies. CPAP therapy is still the primary treatment of OSA, and therapeutic pressure should be individualized by a second sleep study or at home autotitration of CPAP. This treatment should be reserved for patients with DS and for those with severe OSA with or without DS (Fig. 1). Treatment adherence should be assessed periodically and, as for any patient with OSA, must be accompanied by abstention from smoking, alcohol consumption and use of sleeping pills and by active measures to reduce obesity including surgery, if necessary.

Indeed, the impositions of daily life in technologically advanced societies on sleep and wake schedules have markedly shortened the total duration of sleep that children obtain these days. When sleep fragmentation is conducted in healthy adults using auditory stimuli to elicit arousals throughout the night, detriments in performance are clearly apparent the following day. Acute sleep restriction for one night in children has been shown to increase inattentive behavior the following day, although no changes were observed in hyperactive or impulsive behaviors.",

The sleep of older adults tends to be less deep than that of younger people, and coexisting conditions and treatment effects can more easily disrupt sleep. This article reviews the current literature on sleep disruption in older adults and suggests ways that nurses can apply the information in intervening to improve sleep in their older patients. A recent study found that 69% of older adults reported at least one sleep complaint. How aware are you of the ties between sleep and health in this population?",

      "abstract": "Both insomnia complaints and anxiety disorders are common in older adults, and are associated with poor daytime functioning. The present study investigated whether subclinical levels of anxiety were associated with sleep disturbance and daytime functioning in older adults who met diagnostic criteria for primary insomnia, and therefore did not meet criteria for depression or an anxiety disorder. After adjustment for depressive symptoms, elevated state anxiety was associated with higher levels of wake after sleep onset (measured by both actigraphy and sleep log) and shorter sleep onset latency (measured by sleep log). Higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater wake after sleep onset (measured by sleep log). Elevated state and trait anxiety were associated with worse social functioning, and higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with worse role functioning. Thus, subclinical anxiety symptoms may be an important target for clinical intervention to improve sleep and functioning in older adults with primary insomnia.",

Typically it presents in children, most of whom have subjacent epilepsy. It is currently accepted that SESE is asymptomatic, although its persistence may give rise to severe neuropsychological sequelae. There are no references to sleep disorders in these patients. We present the case of a seven year old girl with SESE, hypersomnia and secondary nocturnal enuresis.The seven year old patient had a past history of simple partial crises with motor symptoms. There was progressive hypersomnia and nocturnal enuresis. The polysomnogram showed SESE. The Test for Multiple Latencies in Sleep (TMLS) showed pathological diurnal somnolence. HLA DR2 typing was negative. Neuropsychological study showed severe alterations in the language area, with a normal intelligence quotient.The new findings presented suggested that SESE is an intrinsic sleep disorder and not merely an EEG pattern. Since it occurs in children, sometimes with neuropsychological deficits, systematic TMLS should be done. The association of hypersomnia, changes in immediate visual memory and autistic regression suggest involvement of the limbic system.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

Case report We describe a patient with a longstanding episodic cluster headache who experienced, on two occasions, a period of nocturnal awakenings without pain or autonomic symptoms, lasting one week before the onset of a cluster bout. Awakenings occurred twice/night at the same hours of impending cluster attacks and had no apparent trigger, being unusual for this patient who had no previous sleep disturbances. Neurological examination and brain imaging were normal. Discussion This case documents two new aspects of cluster headache. It suggests that repeated nocturnal awakenings can be a warning sign of an impending cluster period, a finding that may have therapeutic implications, and also that hypothalamic activation may begin several days before trigemino-autonomic symptoms, thus behaving as a true bout generator.",

      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

Cortical spreading depression (a depolarization wave across the brain cortex) is believed to be the underlying mechanism for a migraine aura, and observed vascular changes are considered epiphenomena. It is likely that there is an individual threshold for spreading depression, influenced by genetic factors.1\n\nIn migraine aura status, patients experience a large number of consecutive (mostly) visual auras, very often without headache.2 Between the auras, the patient is without symptoms. Episodes can last for weeks, and within this period several migraine auras can occur on one day. An aura status generally resolves spontaneously, but during the episodes most patients are greatly bothered by it and cannot perform their daily activities.

Symptoms of N1 commonly include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and disturbed nighttime sleep. Ethnic differences have been observed, but they have not been reported in an Ethiopian patient to date.CASE DETAIL: We report a 39-year-old Ethiopian patient with type 1 narcolepsy whose diagnosis was delayed for three decades despite severe symptoms. Her quality of life was significantly impaired and included EDS, sleep fragmentation, and depression. The mean sleep latency (MSL) for five naps was 1.3 minutes. Sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) were present in all five nap periods. HLA-typing and a CSF hypocretin level testing were not performed. Modafinil 300mg was prescribed, which improved her quality of life.CONCLUSION: In developing countries where diagnostic studies are not available, practitioners should pay special attention to a detailed history and look for classic symptoms of narcolepsy to establish an early diagnosis and improve quality of life.",

These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "title": "Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic criteria and treatment of insomnia are reviewed.Insomnia is most often described as a subjective complaint of poor sleep quality or quantity despite adequate time for sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue, irritability, and decreased concentration. Insomnia is classified as idiopathic or comorbid. Comorbid insomnias are associated with psychiatric disorders, medical disorders, substance abuse, and specific sleep disorders. Idiopathic insomnia is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. A wide array of terminology exists for defining the duration of insomnia symptoms, which may add to the confusion regarding insomnia classification. Acute insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting from one night to a few weeks, whereas chronic insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting at least three nights weekly for at least one month. Diagnostic tools for identifying insomnia are multifactorial. Nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia include sleep-hygiene education, stimulus-control therapy, relaxation therapy, and sleep-restriction therapy. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Choice of a specific agent should be based on patient-specific factors, including age, proposed length of treatment, primary sleep complaint, history of drug or alcohol abuse, and cost.Many treatment options are available for patients with insomnia. Behavioral therapies should be initiated as first-line treatment in most patients. For patients who require the addition of pharmacologic therapy, the drugs with the most evidence for benefit include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Selection of a specific agent must take into account numerous patient-specific factors.",

Many individuals with SRED have coexisting sleep disorders that cause partial nighttime arousals. It is also common for patients with SREDs to have a co-incident daytime eating disorder, especially binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. Individuals with SRED may present with complaints of excessive daytime fatigue, multiple nighttime sleep disruptions, and/or weight gain. The onset of SRED is generally in adolescence or young adulthood but may be during childhood or midlife. Prognosis is dependent on identifying and effectively managing any coexisting primary sleep disorder and/or medical disorder. Medication for the treatment of SRED has led to considerable success.

Therefore in clinical practice simultaneous complaints of „not enough“ and „too much“ sleep are very frequent. For the investigation and treatment of organic sleep disorders, available instruments, guidelines and specialised institutions (sleep centres or sleep laboratories) are more advanced than for non-organic sleep disorders. Especially in the child and adolescent psychiatric and psychotherapeutic field this complicates an appropriate treatment. In addition multiple psychiatric, neurological and other somatic diseases can disrupt nighttime sleep and cause impairments during the day too. There are various instruments and methods to cover disturbed nocturnal sleep, some of which have already found widespread use in clinical practice (e. g. sleep diaries or specific questionnaires and interviews). For the examination of daytime sleepiness instruments and methods are available too, which by now seem to be less widely used. Against this background an overview of definitions, distinctive features and clinical instruments as well as guidelines for dealing with “too much and too little sleep” during the day or at night shall be presented.",

Common evening and night time disorders also include restless legs syndrome and associated periodic limb movements of sleep. Screening questions often help to identify the sleep problem that you are dealing with (box 1). Thereafter, sleep problems are best characterised on the basis of a thorough history. A collateral history from the bed partner is often helpful to define any restless legs, sleepwalking or parasomnia, snoring, and breathing abnormalities. Discussing the patient’s ideas about sleep, any concerns they might have, and their expectations of normal sleep is often worth while. #### Box 1: Sleep history questions",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Mental stress is a major issue in today’s competitive environment. Insomnia, memory issues, depression, and other disorders can all be caused by a lack of sleep. Frustration, irritation, and a higher risk of heart disease are all symptoms of stress. Anxiety, inability to concentrate, and car accidents etc. The majority of individuals only sleep for 3-4 hours each day, which is insufficient. Enough. People should sleep for roughly 6-7 hours every day in reality. To alleviate this problem, many people utilize high doses of drugs. This is an issue that is extremely detrimental to the humanbody. There are several options available. Therapy options for insomnia is also there. Yoursleep cycle is regulated by aninternal “body clock” that controls when you feel weary and ready for bed or refreshed and awake which is known as cardiac rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle that this clock follows. You will grow progressively fatigued during the day after waking up from sleep. These emotions will peak in the evening, just before bedtime. Adenosine, anorganic substance generated in the brain, linked to sleep drive, also known as sleep-wake homeostasis. As you get extra weary throughout the day, your adenosine levels rise, and your body subsequently breaks down this chemical while yousleep. The circadian rhythm is also influenced by light. The hypothalamus is a particular area of nerve cellsin the brain,and the suprachiasmatic nucleus is a cluster of cells in the hypothalamus that processes signals when the eyes are exposed to natural or artificial light. The brain uses these signals to decide whether it is day or night. As natural light fades in the evening, the body produces melatonin, a drowsiness-inducing hormone. The hormone cortisol, which increases energy and alertness, is released when the sun rises in the morning. Most individuals require at least seven hours of sleep each night in order to operate well cognitively and behaviorally. An inadequate quantity of sleep might have catastrophic consequences. Sleep deprivation has been linked to attention lapses, impaired cognition, delayed responses, and mood swings in certain studies.",

      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation therapy referred to as \"wake therapy,\" is a robust, rapid-acting, noninvasive antidepressant treatment. Concomitant treatment with medications and post-sleep deprivation chronotherapies such as bright light therapy and sleep phase advance can lengthen the maintenance of improvement from weeks to months. Accumulating data support depression as a circadian-related illness, as evidenced by abnormalities in sleep, mood, hormonal secretions, and/or temperature in a subgroup of depressed patients. An estimated 70%–80% of depressed patients complain of sleep disturbances, including insomnia, -morning awakening, and difficulty in initiating sleep. Studies of the mechanisms of action of sleep deprivation may provide potentially important clues as to the switch process. Sleep deprivation in animals has a wide range of physiological and cognitive effects. Relatively little is understood about the interaction between sleep and depression and why sleep patterns frequently normalize with improvement in symptoms.",

Diagnostic criteria require: I. Progressive motor weakness of more than one limb, and II) absent muscle stretch reflexes. Features that strongly support the diagnosis are: 1. Cease of progression of weakness by 4 weeks, relative symmetrical involvement of the limbs, presence of mild sensory symptoms or signs, involvement of cranial nerves VII (50%) more than IX, X, III, IV and VI, recovery within 2 to 3 weeks after progression stop, presence of autonomic dysfunction, and absent of fever at onset; 2. Cerebral spinal fluid elevation of protein after first week of symptoms and less than 10 mononuclear leukocytes/mm3 except HIV seropositive patients (<50 cells/mm3), and 3. Nerve conduction slowing (<60% of normal ) or block at some point during the illness (80%), and increased distal motor latency up to 3 times above normal and F wave latency. There are four well defined clinical, pathological, neurophysiological and serological subtypes. Acute inflamatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (90%) and Miller Fisher syndrome (5%) are primarily demyelinating. Acute motor axonal neuropathy and acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy are primarily axonal (5%). Treatment includes supportive care and immunotherapy with high doses of intravenous IgG and plasmapheresis.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

Sleep attacks were characterized by lid fluttering and closure, upward turning of the eyes, rapid eye movements, myoclonic twitching of all extremities, and loss of consciousness, lasting one or two minutes and aborted by strong sensory stimulation. At their termination, reports of hallucinoid imagery were given. In a sleep record of 6.5 hours, there were 2.2 hours awake (34%), 4.3 hours desynchronized sleep (66%), and a complete absence of synchronized sleep. Reports of hallucinoid imagery were given after awakenings from desynchronized sleep.

Sleep deprivation induces cellular and organismal stress because it exceeds the physiological and genetically determined time one can maintain wakefulness. There is tremendous variation in sleep requirements across species. The value of the physostigmine challenge test for narcolepsy, response of patients to imipramine, and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of hypocretin and its relevance are examples of information that require greater scrutiny and careful evaluation.

Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5. Many significant questions remain about the pathophysiology and management of this medical emergency which carries a substantial morbidity and mortality. This paper will present the current understanding of SE, identifying gaps in our knowledge. The evidence base for the pharmacological management of SE will be reviewed.",

      "abstract": "The question as to whether the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation in depression is related to the increased wakefulness or to the sleep suppression by itself, is made moot by the search activity concept. According to this concept, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is functionally deficient in depression and increases feelings of helplessness and hopelessness instead of restoring mood and search activity. Thus, REM sleep deprivation, either selective or not, is beneficial by breaking a vicious circle: depression in wakefulness…giving up (helplessness) in dream scenario…increased depression in the subsequent wakefulness. In addition, sleep deprivation is an important challenge for the depressed patient. The ability to confront this challenge and maintain wakefulness has a positive outcome on depression, especially when wakefulness is accompanied by active behavior.",

In the present study, these clinical manifestations were assessed in apneic patients before and 6 months after treatment with nasally applied continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP treatment was found to restore normal respiration during sleep and to normalize sleep organization. Daytime vigilance greatly improved with treatment but some degree of somnolence as compared to normal controls persisted. Similarly, most neuropsychological deficits normalized with treatment. The exception was for planning abilities and manual dexterity, two neuropsychological deficits that have been found to be highly correlated with the severity of nocturnal hypoxemia. These results raise the possibility that anoxic brain damage is a pathogenic factor in severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

As the determinants of daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation is more influential than nocturnal hypoxia. Daytime sleepiness can be improved by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or surgery in up to 95% of the treated subjects. Both sleepiness and nocturnal hypoxia would cause cognitive dysfunction. While impairments in attention and verbal memory are more related with sleepiness and prominent in mild to moderate sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), impairments in general intellectual function and executive function are more related with nocturnal hypoxia and prominent in severe SAS. Several cognitive deficits related with nocturnal hypoxia may be irreversible despite CPAP or surgical treatments. So, early detection and early appropriate treatment of SAS would prevent sleepiness and cognitive deterioration.",

Symptoms of encopresis frequently begin after an illness. They can also result from psychosocial stressors, inappropriate toilet training, or in conjunction with a behavior disorder. Enuresis is an elimination disorder characterized by the repeated voiding of urine in inappropriate places (e.g., bed, clothing, floor) at least twice per week for 3 consecutive months.

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "title": "Contributions to Psychiatry of Recent Studies on Sleep",
      "abstract": "RésuméUne revue de quelques-unes des contributions les plus récentes des études sur le sommeil à la psychiatrie a été présentée. Les effets d'une privation de sommeil dépendent de plusieurs facteurs tels que l'âge, la prise de médicaments, l'état de santé physique et psychologique du sujet et le type de privation (total versus sélectif). Il peut y avoir atteinte des fonctions affectives, cognitives, sensori-perceptuelles, musculo-squelettiques et autonomes. Certains chercheurs pensent que l'état obtenu à la suite d'une privation prolongée de sommeil est un véritable état psychotique tandis que d'autres pensent que des sujets normaux peuvent endurer sans trop de mal une perte prolongée de sommeil; mais un comportement psychotique marqué a été noté chez des sujets ayant des traits de personnalité prédisposants et des patients schizophrènes reconnus ont montré une réactivation de leurs symptômes. Dans la plupart des cas, une privation totale du sommeil provoque une diminution des pulsions tandis qu'une privation sélective augmente ces pulsions et accroît l'excitabilité du système nerveux central. Les personnes présentant une insomnie fonctionnelle, en plus de se plaindre de problèmes communs aux gens âgés, présentent des profils polygraphiques de sommeil semblables à ceux des gens âgés, mais reposant vraisemblablement sur une base physiologique différente. Jusqu'à maintenant, ces études polygraphiques n'ont permis de déterminer aucune caractéristique qui permettrait de différencier une dépression réactionnelle-névrotique d'une dépression psychotique. En ce qui concerne la majorité des états dépressifs, les chercheurs notent de façon générale, une latence accrue dans l'apparition du sommeil, des réveils fréquents, un temps réduit de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et un allongement du sommeil de la phase avec mouvements oculaires (PMO) (tel qu'il peut être observé dans les cas de dépression induits par la réserpine). Les patients atteints de manie montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et du sommeil PMO. On a rapporté chez les schizophrènes aigus une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement du sommeil PMO, un accroissement de l'activité de pointes ponto-géniculo-occipitales (P.G.O.) et une absence du phénomène de “rebound” PMO notée habituellement après privation du sommeil PMO. Des observations similaires ont été effectuées sur des chats préalablement traités avec p-chloro-phenylalanine (un inhibiteur de la synthèse de sérotonine); certains traits de comportement présentés par ces animaux ont été qualifiés de “psychotiques” par certains chercheurs. Comparativement aux cas aigus, les patients schizophrènes chroniques montrent un même accroissement de l'activité de pointes P.G.O. mais une privation de sommeil PMO amène un “rebound” exagéré. Les patients présentant des états confusionnels aigus, de l'hallucinose ou du delirium tremens causés par des agents métaboliques toxiques ou l'alcool montrent un accroissement de sommeil PMO après disparition de l'agent toxique. Généralement, les patients présentant des syndromes cérébraux chroniques et un état de démence montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, une réduction du temps de sommeil PMO et un accroissement ou une réduction du sommeil à ondes lentes. Dans les cas de retard mental, on a trouvé une plus grande proportion de sommeil PMO (par rapport au sommeil total) que chez les sujets normaux. L'énurésie nocturne, le somnambulisme, les cauchemars et la terreur nocturne se produisent habituellement durant un éveil (“arousal”) survenu dans la phase des ondes lentes. Les sédatifs, les phénothiazines et les antidépresseurs provoquent une réduction de temps de sommeil PMO. La réserpine, les tranquillisants mineurs et particulièrement les psychomimétiques provoquent un allongement du sommeil PMO. On a discuté de quelques hypothèses plausibles concernant la pathophysiologie de certains désordres psychiatriques et les mécanismes d'action des mesures thérapeutiques.",

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue.

      "abstract": "There are different forms of sleep apnea, each with different causes. Fortunately, they are all treatable. 1] Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways relax and become blocked during sleep. It is often accompanied by loud snoring or snorting. OSA is the most common form of sleep apnea, 2] Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain stops sending signals to the respiratory muscles while sleeping. Although the airways remain open, breathing stops. CSA is less common than OSA, 3] Mixed sleep apnea is a combination of central and obstructive sleep apnea, and Common to all of these disorders is the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas. Apnea is when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways slacken and collapse to the point that they are completely blocked for 10 seconds or more. Hypopnea is a partial blockage of the airways that decreases airflow by more than 50% for 10 seconds or more.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

We investigated the relevance of this phenomenon in 375 consecutive subjects examined polysomnographically in a sleep disorders center. Rhythmic feet movements while falling asleep (RFM) were found in 28 subjects (7.5%). RFM occurred mostly as single, short series with a duration of between 10 and 15 seconds. They had a high night-to-night variability and were detected as rhythmic, oscillating movements of the whole foot or toes. Surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings displayed series of repetitive phasic bursts with a periodicity mostly between 1 and 2 per second. Single EMG burst duration varied between 300 and 700 msec. RFM at highest intensity occurred during presleep wakefulness, and usually persisted in sleep stages 1 and 2. RFM did not have a major sleep-disturbing effect in any of the affected subjects. Due to its high prevalence and the lack of a major sleep-disturbing effect, short series of RFM could be considered a quasiphysiological phenomenon. However, in more severe forms of RFM with evidence of a sleep-disturbing effect, RFM should be considered abnormal.",

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "title": "Impact of Sleep and Its Disturbances on Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity",
      "abstract": "The daily rhythm of cortisol secretion is relatively stable and primarily under the influence of the circadian clock. Nevertheless, several other factors affect hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Sleep has modest but clearly detectable modulatory effects on HPA axis activity. Sleep onset exerts an inhibitory effect on cortisol secretion while awakenings and sleep offset are accompanied by cortisol stimulation. During waking, an association between cortisol secretory bursts and indices of central arousal has also been detected. Abrupt shifts of the sleep period induce a profound disruption in the daily cortisol rhythm, while sleep deprivation and/or reduced sleep quality seem to result in a modest but functionally important activation of the axis. HPA hyperactivity is clearly associated with metabolic, cognitive and psychiatric disorders and could be involved in the well-documented associations between sleep disturbances and the risk of obesity, diabetes and cognitive dysfunction. Several clinical syndromes, such as insomnia, depression, Cushing's syndrome, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) display HPA hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, psychiatric and metabolic impairments. Further research to delineate the functional links between sleep and HPA axis activity is needed to fully understand the pathophysiology of these syndromes and to develop adequate strategies of prevention and treatment.",

      "title": "Overview of sleep & sleep disorders.",
      "abstract": "Sleep is defined on the basis of behavioural and physiological criteria dividing it into two states: non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep which is subdivided into three stages (N1, N2, N3); and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep characterized by rapid eye movements, muscle atonia and desynchronized EEG. Circadian rhythm of sleep-wakefulness is controlled by the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The neuroanatomical substrates of the NREM sleep are located principally in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus and those of REM sleep are located in pons. A variety of significant physiological changes occur in all body systems and organs during sleep as a result of functional alterations in the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. The international classification of sleep disorders (ICSD, ed 2) lists eight categories of sleep disorders along with appendix A and appendix B. The four major sleep complaints include excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, abnormal movements or behaviour during sleep and inability to sleep at the desired time. The most important step in assessing a patient with a sleep complaint is obtaining a detailed history including family and previous histories, medical, psychiatric, neurological, drug, alcohol and substance abuse disorders. Some important laboratory tests for investigating sleep disorders consist of an overnight polysomnography, multiple sleep latency and maintenance of wakefulness tests as well as actigraphy. General physicians should have a basic knowledge of the salient clinical features of common sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (e.g., jet leg, shift work disorder, etc.) and parasomnias (e.g., partial arousal disorders, REM behaviour disorder, etc.) and these are briefly described in this chapter. The principle of treatment of sleep disorders is first to find cause of the sleep disturbance and vigorously treat the co-morbid conditions causing the sleep disturbance. If a satisfactory treatment is not available for the primary condition or does not resolve the problem, the treatment should be directed at the specific sleep disturbance. Most sleep disorders, once diagnosed, can be managed with limited consultations. The treatment of primary sleep disorders, however, is best handled by a sleep specialist. An overview of sleep and sleep disorders viz., Basic science; international classification and approach; and phenomenology of common sleep disorders are presented.",

These patients had none of the usual causes of excessive daytime somnolence but during sleep exhibited stereotypic body movements, tachycardia, respiratory disturbances, somniloquy, and transient arousals in a repetitive fashion. These episodes induced fragmentation of sleep. The polysomnograms revealed an increase in wakefulness and stage I decreased rapid eye movement during sleep in addition to the episodes of abnormal body movements. No epileptiform features were present either in the electroencephalogram or in the nocturnal polysomnogram. Four of the seven patients were treated with anticonvulsants, with both subjective and objective improvement on subsequent follow-up polysomnograms. Because of the pronounced functional deficits associated with the sleep disorder in these patients, it is of great importance to recognize the disorder and treat it appropriately.",

      "title": "[Management of infantile colics].",
      "abstract": "Infantile colic concerns about 10-30% of all newborns and has been defined as a condition characterized by paroxysmal episodes of unexplained full force crying for at least three days a week and continuing for one week or more in a thriving well-nourished infant. The disorder more likely occurs in the evening, without identifiable causes and resolves spontaneously by the fourth month of life. The several factors involved in the etiopathogenesis (food intolerance or allergy to cow's milk protein, intolerance to lactose, intestinal hyperperistalsis, neuro-hormonal immaturity, maternal anxiety and familial stress), make the management of infants with colics difficult. We propose a scoring system for the evaluation of colics in infants based on: 1) crying intensity and duration; 2) accompanying characteristics of crises (e.g. meteorism, family history for allergic disease, type of feeding, type of stools); 3) evaluation of parents' opinion of their infants' crying. Type of management is based on the score: a) crying that is unrelated to colics: treatments referred to specific diagnosis. b) crying that is related to colics but not severe: first and second step of management; c) crying that is related to colics and is severe: third step of management.first step: pacifier, rocking, dull continuous background noise, hot water bottle on the abdomen, herbal tea, simethicone. Second step: pharmacological treatment and periodic controls. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide). Third step: dietary modification and/or pharmacological treatment: mothers of breast-fed infants are given a diet with no milk or products containing its proteins, or fish, or eggs. Infants who are not breast-fed receive soy milk and if symptoms continue soy milk is substituted with hydrolyzed casein milk formula. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide and in non responders dicyclomine hydrochloride). Dietary modifications appear more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms, since side effects of drugs have been described and our recent results indicate appropriate dietary modifications offer better results than pharmacological treatment in resolving crises. However, before interrupting dietary modifications and reintroducing cow's milk proteins, infant's tolerance to such proteins is tested. In any case because of the good prognosis and rapid regression of symptoms, dietary regimens or pharmacological treatment should only be applied if really necessary and for brief periods under medical supervision.",

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

The patient slept constantly day and night and was awoken by her family for about three-hour period of time. The duration of hypersomnia was about one year until the onset of treatment. The patient was successfully treated with light therapy that caused gradual resolution of the symptoms of hypersomnia. The patient is also treated as prior to the onset of hypersomnia with antipsychotics and the mood stabilizers for schizoaffective disorder. Since that time there were six-year-period of follow up when the patient was free of any symptoms of hypersomnia.",

      "abstract": "Estimates are that 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness, hindering daily functioning and affecting health.' Psychiatric illness is common among people who have a sleep disorder. The relationship between psychiatric illness and sleep disorders is bidirectional: People with mental illness often have sleep complaints, and a primary sleep disorder often results in neuropsychiatric complications. What is obstructive sleep apnea? The most common type of sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by frequent cessations of breathing during sleep because of an obstruction of the upper airway. The obstruction occurs secondary to inadequate motor tone of the tongue or airway dilator muscles, or both) In addition, many people with OSA have central apneic episodes, in which breathing stops temporarily without airway blockage or respiratory [effort.sup.2]. The prevalence of OSA is growing as obesity in the United States increases. Risk factors for OSA include obesity, a craniofacial abnormality, an upper-airway abnormality, heredity, smoking, and nasal congestion. OSA plays a role in causing and exacerbating medical illness in people with severe and persistent mental illness, contributing to a significantly shortened life span. Attending to the general health of people who suffer from severe mental illness--including effective treatment of illnesses such as OSA--is [crucial.sup.3]. Clinical features of OSA OSA is characterized by hypopnea (a decrease in breathing during sleep) or apnea (an actual pause in breathing). Pauses in breathing during sleep of at least 10 seconds, with obstruction of oronasal airflow despite continuous chest and abdominal movements, are referred to as obstructive apneas. These pauses are associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep, or [both.sup.1] Primary features of OSA include sleep fragmentation accompanied by nocturnal hypoxemia and hypercapnia, with resulting excessive daytime sleepiness, mood problems, and poor neurocognitive performance (Table 1). OSA often causes potentially serious organ system dysfunction, including adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects. Studies have suggested that executive dysfunction can be a feature of OSA, which is thought to be related to prefrontal lobe dysfunction caused by intermittent hypoxia. All of these conditions can contribute significantly to decreased quality of [life.sup.1] The prevalence of OSA in the general population is approximately 20% when the condition is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index >5 events an hour. The index is the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes that occur during 1 hour of [leep.sup.4]. OSA and psychiatric illness Psychiatric disorders often are comorbid with OSA. These include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, and substance use disorder. Depression. Several studies have documented that OSA and depressive disorder often are comorbid. Many symptoms are common to both, including fatigue, daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, irritability, and weight gain (Figure, page 62), although some core symptoms of depression (eg, sadness, anhedonia, guilt, and agitation) are clearly distinguishable from symptoms of OSA. The current recommendation is that a mood disorder should be considered secondary to OSA, and treated [accordingly.sup.5]. Anxiety. OSA also has been linked to anxiety and nocturnal panic attacks. Frequent awakening due to choking from breathing cessation might play a role in the development of anxiety in patients with OSA, although the association is unproven. Studies have shown a correlation between anxiety disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness, one of the core symptoms of [OSA.sup.6] OSA is highly prevalent among combat veterans who have PTSD and complain of being overly vigilant at night; experiencing nightmares and frequent awakening; and having nonrestorative [sleep. …",

Perhaps the result of chronic use, a significant deterioration in sleep is apparent over the first 3 weeks of abstinence, with no indication of recovery. Interestingly, the diminished sleep is not accompanied by subjective reports of poor or worsening sleep. Rather, subjective reports actually improve over abstinence, while sleep-related cognitive performance declines. A mechanistic understanding of the apparent difference in objective and subjective measures is currently lacking. Here we review the relevant literature on cocaine use and sleep, and discuss the possible relevance of this sleep disturbance in relationship to the underlying disorder and its treatment.",

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Perceived sleep need can vary among individuals. Even if it shows the same short sleeping duration, it may be caused by different reasons including insomnia symptom, a person who sleep less (short sleeper), or sleep deprivation. To answer this question, we need a fundamental approach to classify Chronic Insomnia Disorder (CID) from various sleep types and to examine neural mechanisms underlying their differences. The present study aim to explore whether brain response to sleep-related picture differs in CID and several sleep types. 55 participants were divided into four groups: 25 Chronic Insomnia Disorder according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 (ICSD-3) criteria (CID; 21 female, age=46.9±12.8), 15 Good Sleepers (GS; 10 female, age=38.4±13.7), 9 Short Sleepers (SS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per day but not have insomnia symptoms; 4 female, age=40.4±12) and 6 Insufficient Sleepers (IS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per weekday and weekend over sleep more than 2 hours; 3 female, age=32.1±16.1). During fMRI, participants completed a sleep-related picture task. To examine group differences in brain response to sleep-related pictures vs. control pictures, one-way ANOVA was conducted. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed to test associations between neural response and clinical features including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS). CID showed significantly greater PSQI, ISI and DBAS scores than three other groups (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, CID group showed increased neural response to sleep-related pictures in bilateral insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left posterior insula (p<0.001, cluster size=50). Brain response in these regions was positively correlated with PSQI and ISI scores (p<0.05). CID showed increased responses to sleep-related pictures in brain regions have been implicated in attention and emotional regulation. These results suggest that there may be attentional bias or emotional response to sleep-related pictures in CID patients.

      "abstract": "Background REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, often associated with dream enactment behaviors, and is typically a prodromal neurodegenerative condition in middle-aged and older adults. However, emerging case reports and case series suggest that not all RBD presentations follow this trajectory, particularly in younger individuals. Case presentation A case of 7-year history of vivid, immersive dreaming perceived as continuous with waking life, accompanied by persistent dream-reality confusion, is described. The patient frequently engaged in reality-testing behaviors and reported significant cognitive fatigue. Video-polysomnography confirmed REM sleep without atonia and a concordant dream re-enactment episode. Neuropsychiatric evaluation ruled out dissociative or psychotic disorders, and no evidence of neurodegenerative disease was observed. Conclusion This presented case illustrates a potentially distinct, non-neurodegenerative REM parasomnia phenotype that underscores the need to expand current parasomnia classifications to better capture the diverse cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of REM sleep disorders. Moreover, potential mechanisms underlying the main features of this case, including immersive dreaming and persistent dream-reality confusion, are discussed in relation to hypothesized dysfunction in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) signaling.",

Summary: The sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a breathing disorder during the sleep characterized by partial prolonged obstruction of the upper airway and/or intermittent complete obstruction, which interrupts the normal breathing ventilation and sleep standards. The difficulties of gas exchange occurring during sleep constitute a spectrum of diseases which varies, in increasing severity, from primary snoring to sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome with severe complications and death risk. Conclusions: During the pediatric routine clinic visit, an item of the anamnesis that should be always present is whether the child snores during the night; in case a history of snoring is found, a more detailed anamnesis, mainly with regard to the existence of signs and/or symptoms of difficult breathing, must be carried out.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "abstract": "Undisturbed sleep of sufficient length is essential for daytime alertness and performance, health and wellbeing. According to recent figures published by the WHO, sleep disturbance is one of the most deleterious non-auditory effects of environmental noise. A connection between noise exposure in the residential setting and detrimental effects on sleep and health is suggested by observational, experimental and epidemiological evidence that has been accumulated over the last decades. Maximum sound pressure levels as low as 33 dB have been shown to induce physiological reactions such as autonomic, motor, and cortical arousals (e.g., tachycardia, body movements, awakenings). Whether or not noise will induce such acute effects depends on the number of noise events and their acoustical properties, but also on situational moderators (e.g. momentary sleep stage) and individual noise sensitivity. Although clinical sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) have been shown to be associated with increased risks for cardiovascular diseases, only little is known about long-term effects of noise-disturbed sleep on cardiovascular health. In the past years, several hints have surfaced that undermine the suspicion that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of long term effects than daytime noise exposure. The paper reviews the present state of research in the domain of noise-induced sleep disturbances from transportation and other noise sources, compares exposure-effect functions, critically appraises methods for the assessment of noise effects on sleep, and reviews potential mechanisms of the genesis of long term health effects due to noise-induced sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Sleep Movements and Respiratory Coupling as a Biobehavioral Marker for Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Independently Dwelling Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract INTRODUCTION: Sleep disorder is often the first symptom of age-related cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or early Alzheimer’s disease. Patient or family sleep complaints in primary care do not reliably lead to screening for sleep or cognitive loss. In this study, poor sleep and arousability were examined using movement arousals, a novel biobehavioral marker of cumulative sleep loss, identified by periodic (circa 4 min) sleep movements (SM). We report that SM events trigger respiratory upregulation (RR) in healthy, but not in MCI-related, sleep. Time latency (TL) between SM-RR events is proposed as a marker of sleep loss and potentially of neurodegeneration associated with cognitive loss in MCI. METHOD . Community-dwelling older adults (N=95; 62-90 years) were tested in the home bed for two days on an “under the sheets” mattress overlay with high sensitivity for respiration and all movement, including micro-movements of SM. Wrist actigraphy (7 days) and standard sleep self-reports were collected as well. A suite of neurocognitive testing identified three groups: Normal Cognition (NC; n=45); clinic diagnosed MCI (MCI-DX; n= 17); and MCI-Consensus determined by an expert panel (MCI-CON; n=33 consensus or pre-clinical MCI) groups. RESULTS: In adjusted cohort analyses, sleep fragmentation (SF) and WASO predicted poorer memory performance selectively. Actigraphy revealed greater sleep latency (SL; p&lt;.008), sleep duration (p&lt;.01) and SF (p=.008) in MCI-DX compared to NC groups. Longer SL and poor sleep were associated with depression which was more prevalent in both MCI groups than NC. Neural Networks AI methods were applied to discriminate MCI and NC cases using the TL metric between SM-RR coupling events. ROC diagnostics were applied which identified MCI vs. NC cases with 87% sensitivity; 89% specificity; and 88% positive predictive value. DISCUSSION: MCI cognitive phenotype was detected with a novel sleep biomarker TL, associated with the tight gap between SM-RR coupling, which is proposed as a corollary of sleep quality/loss that affects the autonomic regulation of respiration during sleep. Movement arousals are less effective in initiating respiratory upregulation in MCI which suggests a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative changes and cognitive loss in early MCI.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.",

      "title": "The Morbidity of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine mechanisms are major determinants of the normal 24-h blood pressure (BP) pattern. At the central level, integration of the major driving factors of this temporal variability is mediated by circadian rhythms of monoaminergic systems in conjunction with those of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, opioid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, plus endothelial systems and specific vasoactive peptides. Humoral secretions are typically episodic, coupled either to sleep and/or the circadian endogenous (suprachiasmatic nucleus) central pacemaker clock, but exhibiting also weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual periodicities. Sleep induction and arousal are influenced also by many hormones and chemical substances that exhibit 24-h variation, e.g., arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, melatonin, somatotropin, insulin, steroids, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, endogenous opioids, and prostaglandin E2, all with established effects on the cardiovascular system. As a consequence, physical, mental, and pathologic stimuli that activate or inhibit neuroendocrine effectors of biological rhythmicity may also interfere with, or modify, the temporal BP structure. Moreover, immediate adjustment to exogenous components/environment demands by BP rhythms is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of biological oscillators and their neuroendocrine effectors. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of abnormalities of the 24-h BP pattern and level and their correction through circadian rhythm-based chronotherapeutic strategies.

Thirteen of these attacks arose from sleep. Seven attacks were reported after waking in the morning or shortly before going to sleep. The beginnings of sleep-related attacks were distributed arbitrarily between different non-REM sleep stages. No association of CH attacks with REM or sleep disordered breathing was observed. Increased heart rate temporally associated with transition from one sleep state to another was observed before patients awoke with headache. Total sleep time, total wake time, arousal index and distribution of non-REM sleep stages were different between chronic and episodic CH.CH attacks are not associated with REM sleep. Brain regions involved in sleep stage transition might be involved in pathophysiology of CH.

This common problem affects all age groups but may have more pronounced effects on the elderly, whose recovery rate is more prolonged than that in young adults.1\r\n\r\nA multitude of factors, such as the number of time zones crossed and the direction and timing of flights, play a role in the severity of symptoms experienced by travelers. Individual variability accounts for the ability to adapt to a new time zone and the duration of the symptomatic period. Travelers usually experience symptoms after air travel across at least two time zones. Symptoms may include disturbed sleep, daytime fatigue, decreased ability to perform mental and physical tasks, reduced alertness, and headaches. Sleep disturbances typically last for a few days, but they can persist for as long as one week if the change in time zones is greater than eight hours. Eastward travel is associated with a longer duration of jet lag than westward travel. Although frequent desynchrony is a transient disorder, it carries the potential to lead to long-term consequences, as evidenced by epidemiological and animal studies.2,3 Sequelae have included cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and an increased risk of cancer, infertility, and heart disease. As the body’s internal circadian “clock” adapts to the new time zone, jet lag diminishes.\r\n\r\nStrategies to minimize the effects of jet lag include adjusting the sleep schedule according to the new location during the days preceding the trip. This approach may be helpful for travel that lasts for more than a week, but it does not appear useful for short-term trips. Both alcohol and caffeine can adversely affect quality of sleep when they are consumed a few hours before bedtime; caffeine intake should be planned to enhance daytime alertness. When passengers are traveling, they are advised to avoid alcohol, especially while they are being treated for jet lag.\r\n\r\nTreatment may include non-pharmacological therapy alone or non-pharmacological therapy combined with nutraceuticals or pharmacological therapy. A non-pharmacological approach, including adequate exercise, hydration, and appropriate timing of exposure to bright light, can aid in the adjustment to a new time zone. Nutraceuticals and pharmacological therapies include melatonin, melatonin receptor analogues (agonists), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, caffeine, diphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl, McNeil; Aler-Dryl, Reese), and armodafinil (Nuvigil, Cephalon).\r\n\r\nA review of treatments and potential strategies follows.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve abnormal actions or experiences during sleep, often due to dissociated states in which there is a simultaneous coexistence of sleep and wake. Parasomnias are divided into two categories: those that occur during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and those occurring during rapid eye movement sleep (REM). NREM parasomnias include sleepwalking and night terrors. Examples of REM parasomnias are nightmares, hypnogogic hallucinations, and REM behavior disorder. Although many parasomnias in themselves are considered benign, they are clinically relevant as some have been shown to be associated with psychiatric illness (e.g., nightmare disorder) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., REM behavior disorder).",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

While this is an adaptive response, it also contributes to the general physical deterioration consequent to prolonged exposure to high altitudes, and is even implied in specific syndromes: acute mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high altitude cerebral edema. Muscular sympathetic nervous activity increases at simulated high altitudes (hypoxic mixture or hypobaric chamber), and HAPE-susceptible subjects show an exaggerated response. Increases in plasma and urinary catecholamines take several days to appear: they are observed rarely at simulated altitudes but frequently on the field. Heart rate variability decreases at high altitudes, particularly in subjects suffering from acute mountain sickness. The low frequency component has been described in healthy subjects as increased or decreased, but is reduced in sympatomatic subjects; increases in the low frequency/high frequency ratio are reported in all studies. Few and discordant data are available regarding baroreflex sensitivity at high altitudes. Some (past and present) authors regard parasympathetic fitness as a defense against illness at high altitudes. Current guidelines advise against high altitude exposure for cardiac patients in whom sympathetic arousal would be too risky.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and sleep deprivation are intimately related to performance. Sleep management of people working in different sectors of the society like multi shift workers, nurses, doctors, students in professional schools and the armed forces has a great bearing on performance, health and safety of the subject population. The detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on psychological performance are indicated as increased lapsing, cognitive slowing, memory impairment, decrease in vigilance and sustained attention and shift in optimum response capability. Its effects on physical performance are manifested as decline in ability to perform maximal exercise, self-selected walking pace and increase in perceived exertion. Sleep deprivation appears to have no effect in respect of muscle contractile properties and maximum anaerobic power. At high altitude (HA), there is a reduction in NREM sleep with frequent awakening due to hypoxia as a physiological adaptive measure to prevent accentuation of hypoxemia due to sleep-hypoventilation. Total sleep deprivation for 48 hours at high altitude can affect the acclimatization status, thermoregulation efficiency and cognitive functions. The concept of 'sleepiness' has also been studied, as it is an emerging concept for better understanding of the effects of sleep deprivation and its effects on performance. A special mention of sustained operations in the armed forces has been made keeping in mind its uniqueness in challenging the normal sleep-work schedule and its deployment in extreme environment and operational condition. This article reviews in detail the functions of sleep, its requirement and the effects of sleep deprivation on human performance.",

      "title": "0806 REM sleep without atonia in the Setting of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Can it Serve a Protective Role?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has well-known associations with sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation. These disorders naturally follow from the progressive muscle weakness that is the hallmark of DMD. New data is emerging on the prevalence of other polysomnographic features affecting patients with DMD, particularly as they relate to the phenotype of the sleep disorders unique to DMD. We report on a patient with REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in DMD. Report of Cases: A 13-year-old male with DMD was referred for a polysomnogram (PSG) due to new-onset snoring, but there was no history to suggest dream enactment behavior. He was not taking any CNS-acting medication such as serotonergic or sedative-hypnotic medications. Neurologic examination was notable for diffuse symmetric muscle weakness requiring the use of a wheelchair. PSG revealed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with an apnea-hypopnea index of 3/hr overall and 5/hr during REM sleep, a respiratory disturbance index of 9/hr with minimum O saturation of 84%, and evidence of RWA in three 30-second epochs meeting AASM scoring criteria. Dream-enactment behavior was absent during the PSG and historically. Conclusion We report on a previously unrecognized finding of RWA the setting of DMD. While sleep studies are routinely performed in DMD due to the significant association with sleep-disordered breathing and REM-related hypoventilation, the presence of RWA was unusual. The finding of RWA in the setting of a dystrophinopathy prompts important questions. While it is unlikely that RWA is an emerging sign of an ⍺-synucleinopathy in the setting of DMD, its presence in a young teenager raises the possibility of hypocretin deficiency in the setting of DMD, as is the case with myotonic dystrophy type 1 reflecting impaired hypocretin neurotransmission. However, a more attractive explanation is that RWA may promote a protective effect against sleep apnea in patients with vulnerability to REM-related hypoventilation. Our data suggest a potential protective role conferred by the preservation of muscle tone in the setting of sleep apnea in neuromuscular conditions. Support (If Any) None",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

      "abstract": "Rolandic epilepsy or benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is called benign because its seizures are usually favourable and due to the spontaneous normalisation of the electroencephalogram on reaching puberty. Nevertheless, evidence has been found of the impact on cognitive development with the presence of heterogeneous cognitive deficits, especially related to persistent intercritical discharges during non-REM sleep. The aim of this study is to examine the epileptogenic networks involved in the neuropsychological disorders of this pathology.A common feature of the atypical developments is persistent epileptic activity during slow sleep, which plays an important role in the development of the neurocognitive deficits that are associated to this pathology. Factors such as the age at onset of the epilepsy, the onset of the atypical development, the location of the interictal discharges and the continuous epileptic activity during sleep that persists for more than two years can trigger changes in the functioning of the neurocognitive networks. This may result in deficits in the neuropsychological functions, which may even be irreversible.A close clinical and electroencephalographic follow-up is necessary. Moreover, formal neuropsychological studies must be conducted as of the onset of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. This is even more necessary in cases in which there is an obvious atypical development in order to detect and prevent the neuropsychological deficits before they establish themselves on a definitive basis.Las alteraciones neuropsicologicas son frecuentes en la epilepsia rolandica y sus evoluciones atipicas.Introduccion. La epilepsia rolandica o epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales se denomina benigna debido a lo favorables que suelen ser sus crisis y a la espontanea normalizacion del electroencefalograma al llegar a la pubertad, aunque se ha demostrado el impacto sobre el desarrollo cognitivo con la presencia de deficits cognitivos heterogeneos, relacionados especialmente con las descargas intercriticas persistentes durante el sueño no REM. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar las redes epileptogenas involucradas en los trastornos neuropsicologicos de esta patologia. Desarrollo. Las evoluciones atipicas tienen en comun una actividad epileptica persistente durante el sueño lento, que desempeña un papel importante en el desarrollo de los deficits neurocognitivos que se asocian a esta patologia. Factores como la edad de inicio de la epilepsia, el inicio de la evolucion atipica, la localizacion de las descargas interictales y la actividad epileptica continua durante el sueño que persista durante mas de dos años pueden provocar cambios en el funcionamiento de las redes neurocognitivas, con los consecuentes deficits en las funciones neuropsicologicas, que incluso pueden resultar irreversibles. Conclusiones. Es necesario un seguimiento cercano tanto clinico como electroencefalografico; ademas, deben realizarse estudios neuropsicologicos formales desde el inicio de la epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales y mas en los casos que es evidente una evolucion atipica para detectar y prevenir los deficits neuropsicologicos antes de que se instauren definitivamente.",

When awake BP is controlled by sympathetic nervous system activity but during sleep the renin–angiotensin system becomes more important. The lower BP during sleep is a more powerful predictor of outcome than the awake BP. Certain individuals do not have the fall in BP with sleep and this worsens the outcome. Inadequate handling of sodium by the kidney is an important factor preventing this BP fall. The different drug classes have varying effects on BP during 24 h. Drugs that act independently of the two controlling systems have a similar effect at day and night. Drugs that act on the sympathetic nervous system have a greater effect during the day and little effect during sleep unless the sympathetic system is still active.

      "title": "Electroclinical features of idiopathic generalised epilepsy with persisting absences in adult life.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the electroclinical features of typical absences persisting in adult life. METHODS: Twelve adult patients (aged 21 to 56 years) with idiopathic generalised epilepsy featuring typical absences as the prominent clinical feature were studied. All patients underwent a full clinical and neurophysiological investigation including ictal documentation of seizures. RESULTS: Neurological examination and neuroradiological investigations were normal in all cases. Clinical findings included a median age at onset of absences of 14 (range 4-32) years, almost constant tonic-clonic seizures (in 83% of patients), frequent episodes of absence status (in 33% of patients), and associated cognitive or psychiatric disturbances. Interictal EEG findings showed normal background activity, generalised paroxysms of spike waves or polyspike waves, and inconstant focal spikes (in five patients); runs of polyspikes were seen during non-REM sleep. Ictal EEG findings showed generalised spike waves at 3 Hz, sometimes preceded by multiple spikes, or more complex EEG patterns with sequences of polyspikes intermingled with spike waves or polyspike waves, showing discharge fragmentation or variation of intradischarge frequency. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that absences persisting in adult life may show particular clinical and EEG patterns, distinct from those in childhood or adolescence.",

No other abnormal cyclic phenomena such as alterations in sleep structure, diurnal variations in hemoglobin, hematocrit, electrolytes, body temperature, blood pressure or pulse rate was found. In view of the fact that cyclic esotropia may represent an impairment of the \"biological clock\" thought to be located in the hypothalamus, detailed studies of the hypothalamic hypophyseal axis were performed and found to be normal.

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

Mechanisms underlying narcolepsy are not fully understood. Experimental data indicate that the disease is caused by a loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus, likely due to an autoimmune process triggered by environmental factors in susceptible individuals. Most patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy have very low hypocretin-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, and multiple sleep latency test are necessary for diagnosis of the disease. Additionally, two biological markers, i.e., cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and expression of the DQB1*0602 gene, are used. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed at the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with psychostimulants (amphetamine-like, modafinil and armodafinil). Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate (GHB), tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and fragmented sleep may be treated with sodium oxybate. Patients with narcolepsy should follow proper sleep hygiene and avoid strong emotions.",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

      "title": "Psychophysiological insomnia: the behavioural model and a neurocognitive perspective",
      "abstract": "A number of paradoxes are apparent in the assessment and treatment of psychophysiological insomnia and sleep state misperception. Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain. In the case of subjective-objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more 'sleep-like' EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset-related mesograde amnesia. As a result, the patient with insomnia maintains a level of information and/or memory processing that blurs the phenomenological distinction between sleep and wakefulness and influences retrospective judgments about sleep initiation and duration.",

      "abstract": "Aim : To review what is known about the role of sleep and arousal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of nocturnal enuresis. Methods : A review of the literature was carried out. Results : The sleep of enuretic children, although polysomnographically quite normal, is exceedingly “deep”; that is enuretic children have high arousal thresholds. Apart from some overlap between enuresis and the (other) classic parasomnias, the sleep of enuretic children is no more problematic than that of the general population. Recently, the exciting possibility has arisen that the low arousability of enuretic children may be linked to the autonomous nervous system and to disturbances in the upper pons. Conclusions : Enuresis is not just a nocturnal problem but a disorder of sleep. The high arousal threshold is one of three major pathogenetic factors in enuresis—nocturnal polyuria and detrusor hyperactivity being the other two.",

Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders include a reduction / cessation of dreaming, an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments, and the occurrence of dreamlike experiences (hallucinations) mainly during the wake- -sleep/sleep-wake transitions. Dream changes can be associated with several neurological conditions, and the unfolding of biological knowledge about dream experiences can also have significance in clinical practice.

      "abstract": "In 3 patients with the syndrome of Unverricht-Lundborg's myoclonus-epilepsy electropolygraphic examinations were carried out during night sleep. A substantial disorganization of the sleep was revealed, the degree of which correlated with the gravity of the clinical picture. This disorganization manifested itself in pronounced changes of the electroencephalographic phenomenology of the sleep and disturbance of its structure with a prolongation of the 1st stage and the delta-sleep and a shortening of the 2nd stage and the quick sleep phase. An insufficient EEG desynchronization was noted in the periods of awakeness, drowsiness, and quick sleep: this pointed to defective functioning of the brain desynchronizing systems. In distinction from other forms of epilepsy the pathological paroxysmal activity was prevalent also in the period of the awakeness, and diminished in parallel with the depth of the sleep. The myoclonic hyperkinesis got also weaker at the stage of slow sleep, but became more intense at the quick sleep stage. The data obtained point to a pronounced dysfunction of the non-specific activating and deactivating systems of the brain in myoclonus-epilepsy. This dysfunction is associated with an organic affection of the trunco-diencephalic structures and the influence of the active epileptic process.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Isolated sleep paralysis (ISP) occurs when rapid eye movement (REM)-based atonia intrudes into wakefulness, outside the context of narcolepsy, substance abuse, mental disorder or other medical conditions. No “gold standard” assessment and diagnostic instrument currently exists. Report of Case A 63-year old female with hypersomnia and positive airway pressure (PAP)-controlled obstructive sleep apnea was referred for recurrent episodes of paralysis during sleep-wake transitions, lasting 15-20 seconds, occurring every 2-3 years since the age of 15, and associated with fear and anxiety. Episodes were more frequent in the last 2 years after significant sleep deprivation and starting a weight loss supplement, BIO-X4, which contains green tea and probiotics. No cataplexy, or history of traumatic brain injury and stroke were identified. Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 14 on armodafinil. Reported sleep amounts were regularly scheduled 6-7-hour periods, with no suggestion of circadian dysfunction. In 2016, polysomnogram showed Apnea-Hypopnea index of 2.6/hour, Respiratory Disturbance Index of 13.8/hour with oxygen nadir of 92% in the setting of hypersomnia. Continuous PAP of 11 cmH20 was initiated after a successful titration with controlled residual AHI during follow-ups. Multiple Sleep Latency Test during the same time revealed mean sleep latency of 5.5 minutes and no sleep-onset REM with 5 naps. Brain imaging and electroencephalogram were both normal as well as drug panel, blood counts, metabolic profile and thyroid function. Decreased episodes and severity of recurrent ISP were reported after discontinuation of the supplement. Apart from anxiety related to the episodes, the patient denied any interference with daytime function. Conclusion Isolated sleep paralysis is an important sleep disorder that requires proper evaluation to rule out competing diagnoses and consideration of therapeutic interventions. Likely associated with a lack of understanding and available literature, the prevalence in the general population is likely higher than what is currently perceived.",

Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age.

Sleep is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of body homeostasis. Many disease processes affecting sleep have been associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, fatigue as well as a wide range of behavioral, hormonal and metabolic derangements. Sleep disorders in childhood can be classified by age of incidence (in infants, toddlers, school-age children or adolescents) and by the exact nature of the symptoms. They are classified in insomnias, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm disorders and respiratory disorders which affect sleep. Parasomnias are the most common sleep disorders in toddlers, with night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking being the most common. Respiratory disorders are the most important in older children, especially obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. All sleep disorders are clinically manifested with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Their management always involves improvement of sleep hygiene, though in some cases (such as obstructive sleep apnea) specific medical treatment is also available and warranted. A three-way relationship of trust, compassion and cooperation between child, family and healthcare professional is a prerequisite for the effective management of childhood sleep disorders. Nursing staff are the main factor cultivating that relationship in the context of inpatient care.",

      "abstract": "AbstractNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder affecting the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. It is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-associated manifestations (eg, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The recognition of this disorder is usually delayed by 10 to 15 years, largely because of its protean manifestations, insidious nature, and lack of physician awareness. Delayed diagnosis is associated with poor quality of life, depression, and increased likelihood of accidents. Health care providers should include narcolepsy in the differential diagnosis of patients with excessive sleepiness, chronic fatigue, sleep-disordered breathing, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder that often requires pharmacological treatments, which may include wake-promoting stimulants for excessive sleepiness and γ-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate) and antidepressants for REM sleep-associated manifestations. This article presents a case of a 47-year-old man with long-standing sleepiness and cataplexy who was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy 30 years after the first onset of symptoms. The presenting manifestations of narcolepsy, diagnostic criteria, and its management are also discussed.Keywords: narcolepsyhypersomniasleepinesscataplexyREM sleep",

One of the most common dyssomnias with imperative sleepiness is narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic disease that greatly affects quality of life. The present study of 57 patients shows that the negative assessment is partly due to the subjective views exhibited by the narcoleptic personality prone to underestimation, negative self-image and depressive disposition. The personality traits may be due to an adaptation reaction to the disease but also to the biological predisposition. Comparison with population data for our Republic brought no evidence of progress at education or family life being adversely affected by narcolepsy, however, decreased assertion in employment and limitation in self-realization in free time was an explicit consequence of the disease. All 57 patients reported excessive daytime sleepiness as the most discomforting symptom that in 40% of them was responsible for career curtailment in a productive age and for living on partial or full disability.",

      "title": "Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss",
      "abstract": "LeGros TL, Murphy-Lavoie H. Hyperbaric Treatment of Air or Gas Embolism: Current Recommendations. Undersea Hyperb Med. 2024 Fourth Quarter; 51(4):425-448. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) presents as the abrupt onset of hearing loss. Approximately 88% of SSNHL has no identifiable etiology and is termed idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) [1]. Hearing specialists have investigated ISSHL since the 1970s. Over the past 30 years, more than 800 articles, or one every two weeks, have been published in the English medical literature [2]. ISSHL is the abrupt onset of hearing loss, usually unilaterally and upon wakening, that involves a hearing loss of at least 30 decibels (dB) occurring within three days over at least three contiguous frequencies [3-4]. As most patients do not present with premorbid audiograms, the degree of hearing loss is usually defined by the presentation thresholds of the unaffected ear [4]. Other associated symptoms include tinnitus, aural fullness, dizziness and vertigo [4-5]. The historical incidence of ISSHL ranges from 5–20 cases/100,000 population, with approximately 4,000 new cases per annum in the United States [4,6]. The true incidence is thought to be higher, as ISSHL is thought to be underreported. Interestingly, 4,000 cases annually calculate to 1.3 cases/ 100,000 in the United States; therefore, an incidence of 5–20/100,000 would translate to &gt; 15,000 new ISSHL cases per annum in the United States. Recent literature has placed the annual ISSHL incidence in the United States as 27 cases/100,000, with a pediatric incidence of 11 cases/100,000 [7]. Other studies report that the incidence is increasing (160/100,000), especially in the elderly (77/100,000), and conclude that ISSHL is no longer rare [7-9]. In 1984, Byl reviewed the literature and found the mean age of ISSHL presentation to be 46–49 years, with variation of incidence with age and an equal gender distribution [6,10-13]. The presentation of ISSHL does not appear to have seasonal variations, uneven distributions of presentation throughout the year, or an association with upper respiratory infections, either prior to or following symptom onset [14]. The spontaneous recovery is currently thought to be 30–60% [15-17].",

      "title": "Cardiovascular Reflexes and Autonomic Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical features of autonomic neuropathy include postural hypotension, sweating abnormalities, disturbance of body temperature regulation, gastric fullness and nausea, intermittent nocturnal diarrhoea, constipation, bladder problems and impotence. In diabetic patients, gustatory sweating and hypoglycaemic unawareness also sometimes occur (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974). The onset of symptoms is usually insidious and permanent, but may occasionally be acute and reversible (Young, Asbury, Corbett &amp; Adams, 1975). Autonomic dysfunction can arise from three main causes: first, those where the damage to the autonomic nervous system is isolated, as in primary postural hypotension (Bannister, Sever &amp; Gross, 1977) and familial dysautonomia (Brunt &amp; McKusick, 1970); secondly, those caused by toxic or pharmacological agents which interfere with autonomic reflexes; thirdly, those associated with systemic disease, of which diabetes mellitus is the most common. Other diseases which may cause autonomic dysfunction include amyloidosis, porphyria, tetanus, polyneuritis, tabes dorsalis, parkinsonism, chronic renal failure and alcoholism, and occasionally autonomic neuropathy has been associated with carcinoma of the bronchus or the pancreas (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974). Although it is possible to localize lesions within the autonomic nervous system to afferent or efferent sympathetic or parasympathetic pathways (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974; Moskowitz, 1977), many of the available tests are complex and invasive and often lack adequate control measurements (Young et al., 1975). Because of the patchy nature of autonomic neuropathy, current interest has centred around the search for bedside tests that are ‘global’, reproducible and non-invasive. This review summarizes the present state of knowledge of simple tests of cardiovascular reflex function in the clinical evaluation of autonomic neuropathy, particularly in diabetic subjects.",

      "title": "Trends in utilisation of hypnotics among Scandinavian young people",
      "abstract": "We spend about one-third of our lives in a state of sleep. This makes sleep the single activity that occupies the most of our time.1 Today's society is burdened by insufficient sleep, and sleep deprivation is known to have an enormous impact on daily life and to be associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes. Daily life consequences include disruption of a person's ability to think and focus,2 which may be of particular importance during developmental periods such as childhood and adolescence. Medium- and long-term consequences include higher risk of mood problems,3 metabolic abnormalities and obesity,4 poor cognitive and academic performance 5 and even degenerative diseases such as dementia.6 Although most times underdiagnosed, sleep disorders are particularly common among children and young people, and even more so in those with comorbid mental health problems (including anxiety and depressive disorders) or neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and autism spectrum disorders [ASD]).7 The prevalence rates of sleep disorders in children, adolescents and young adults are particularly hard to estimate given their high variability. This can be explained by a number of factors such as the age range of interest, inter-individual variability, discrepancies in reporting by patients and caregivers, different definitions of the various sleep problems in the current diagnostic classification systems, cross-cultural and contextual factors, and presence/absence of mental health or neurodevelopmental comorbidities.8 As an example, although we all know that insomnia is common among adolescents, studies may report prevalence rates that range between 7% and 40% depending on the diagnostic criteria used.9 In this study, Wesselhoeft and colleagues examined trends in the utilisation of three groups of hypnotic drugs, namely melatonin, z-drugs and sedating antihistamines among children, adolescents and young adults (age range 5 to 24 years) in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, from 2012 to 2018.10 The study shows that trends differed markedly among the three Scandinavian countries. In brief, in this period, melatonin and antihistamine use increased among young Scandinavians, and the increase was twice as high in Sweden as in Norway and Denmark. Sweden had the highest use of sedating antihistamines.10 With regard to sex-related differences in prescribing patterns, the authors found that males were twice as likely to use melatonin before age 15 years, whereas females were more likely to use z-drugs and sedating antihistamines after age 15 years. Data on prescribed medications extracted from public data registries are frequently used in the literature as a proxy to estimate the prevalence of various diseases. However, the authors raise a caution flag with regard to the interpretation of the main study variable, namely filled prescriptions for a particular hypnotic from 2012 to 2018. Throughout their work, the authors clearly state that the main aim of the study was to describe utilisation patterns of hypnotics and not prevalence estimates of sleep disorders. The study does not include information regarding the actual indications for hypnotic use.10 Assuming that all patients who take a given drug do have a specific disease may lead to overestimation of the prevalence of that disease. Many of these medications are frequently used for mental disorders other than sleep disorders. For example, drugs such as antihistamines may be used for the treatment of disorders highly prevalent in childhood, such as acute otitis media or allergic rhinitis. Conversely, patients with sleep disorders may be prescribed alternative hypnotic drugs that were not explored in this study, such as clonidine, one of the most commonly prescribed agents for children with ASD or ADHD and comorbid insomnia in the US, or trazodone for children with sleep problems related to anxiety or depression.11 This could lead to underestimation of the prevalence of sleep disorders. Furthermore, the data sources used in this study only allow the authors to report the proportion of individuals treated at any point during a given year and not at the same time, a difference particularly important for drugs such as melatonin that some patients use only briefly. The authors posit that the observed variation in hypnotic use among Scandinavian countries could reflect differences in the prevalence of sleep problems among Scandinavian populations. In this regard, they state that higher levels of general sleep and emotional problems in Swedish adolescents could be contributing to the higher use of hypnotics in that country. Previous publications show how sleep patterns and sleep problems may vary across different countries and cultures. The AdolesHealth Study assessed perceived sleep quality and duration in 1717 European adolescents from three different European countries (Spain, Iceland, and Estonia) aged 13 to 16 years and enrolled in public and private secondary schools.12 While no differences were found regarding sleep duration, Spanish and Estonian adolescents reported higher probabilities of having poor sleep quality. Sleep disturbances may also depend on contextual factors. For example, emerging evidence suggests that neighbourhood environment can impact paediatric sleep, such that children living in low-income neighbourhoods seem to be at higher risk of negative sleep outcomes, including shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing and obstructive sleep apnoea.13 Other contextual factors, such as the increasing use of social media and electronic devices by European youth have also changed sleep habits in children and young people.14 A recently identified and ‘unexpected’ contextual factor that has dramatically changed sleep patterns and has resulted in increased rates of sleep problems in children and adults is the COVID-19 pandemic and particularly the need for confinement. A recently published study evaluated sleep patterns, sleep disturbances and associated factors in Chinese pre-schoolers confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak.15 These children showed marked changes in their sleep patterns such as later bedtimes and wake times and longer nocturnal and shorter nap sleep durations, alongside fewer caregiver-reported sleep disturbances.15 The study by Wesselhoeft et al. does not address this possibility as it only includes data up until 2018.10 The authors propose some other alternative factors that could be contributing to the increasing rates of hypnotic use in Scandinavian countries in recent years (especially in Sweden).10 The increase in diagnoses of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, particularly in males, and affective disorders such as depression, particularly in females, could partially explain the growing use of hypnotics and the sex-related observed variability in prescriptions. Variation in mental health care access among Scandinavian countries (Sweden has the highest availability of child psychiatrists per 100,000 young people in Europe); variation in prescribing practices among Scandinavian doctors, including reduced use of non-pharmacological treatments such as behavioural therapy and sleep hygiene psychoeducation, which would result in clinicians resorting to medication approaches; and changes in prescription with changes in EMA approvals are also posited as potential factors contributing to the observed trends in hypnotic use. In summary, healthy sleep is a good preventative measure for mental health especially in a vulnerable population such as children and adolescents.16 Not only are sleep disorders underdiagnosed but sleep symptoms are early predictors of the onset or relapse of many disorders. Prescription of hypnotics is only an indirect way to research this neglected area of psychiatry. Given this major challenge, we must not fall asleep at the wheel.

      "abstract": "We report the case of a 5-year-old girl with frequent nocturnal episodes of disorder of arousal (confusional arousals, sleep terrors, and sleep walking), occurring at the end of periods of slow wave sleep, followed by return to sleep accompanied by the occurrence of periodic breathing with a run of approximately 10 to 20 central events. The duration of the central events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation were both maximum at the beginning of each run and became progressively less prominent with the development of the sequences. Night episodes disappeared with bedtime clonazepam but behavioral problems occurred as a paradoxical response; thus, clonazepam was stopped. Sleep extension and melatonin were then started, which were followed by a reduction of night episode frequency and intensity. This observation appears to be the first report of central sleep apnea sequences triggered by parasomnia and, if confirmed by additional reports, it might be considered to be a possible new classification of \"complex parasomnia.\"",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is frequently acquainting as an abnormal accumulation of body fat to the degree that may cause serious health consequences. ( Yanovski et al. , 2014). One of the most common complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a widespread complaint that is closely associated with global obesity epidemics, and it is described as frequent complete or partial flop of the upper airway during sleep leading to gaseous exchange impairment and disturbance of sleep. It is the commonest category of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the world as reported in different epidemiological studies. (McNicholas et al ., 2007). Central sleep apnea : is described  as decreased respiratory effort leading to decrease or absence of ventilation .While in mixed apnea it is categorized by starting centrally and ending with obstructive events.In obstructive sleep apnea: the effort of  respiration is preserved but ventilation decrement  or absence due to partial or total obstruction in the upper airway; apnea is well-defined as the total airflow cessation lasting 10 sec. or more , There are three types of apneas :obstructive, central and mixed . A hypopnea: is defined as a reduction in airflow (30-50%) that is followed by an arousal from sleep or a decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (3-4%)( The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999 and Kushida et al .,2005). The severity of sleep apnea is evaluated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. According to the American Academy of sleep Medicine recommendations , OSA is defined with AHI>5., and it is classified as mild OSA with AHI of 5 to 15;moderate OSA with AHI of 16 to 30;and severe OSA with AHI > 30.(The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999). The Apnea–Hypopnea Index or Apnoea–Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to determine sleep apnea severity. It is characterized by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining AHI and oxygen desaturation measurement gives a complete sleep apnea severity score that assesses the number of sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation.               (Ruehland et al .,2009 ). The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values are categorized as Normal: 0-4;Mild Sleep Apnea: 5-14;Moderate Sleep Apnea: 15-29; Severe Sleep Apnea: 30 or more.(Ruehland et al ., 2009 ).",

      "abstract": "Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

A scoring system to evaluate the literature was created and implemented. The aim was to identify the evidence with the least amount of confound, allowing for more reliable determinations of iatrogenic etiology.Points were provided for the following criteria: manuscript type (abstract, peer-reviewed paper); population size studied (large retrospective study, small case series, case report); explicitly stated dosage timing; identification of peak symptoms related to time of medication administration (i.e., medication was ingested in the evening or at bedtime); initiation of a treatment plan; symptoms subsided or ceased with decreased dosage or drug discontinuation (for RLS articles only); negative personal history for RLS prior to use of the medication; exclusion of tobacco/alcohol/excessive caffeine use; exclusion of sleep disordered breathing by polysomnography (PSG); and PSG documentation of presence or absence of PLMS. For RLS and PLMS articles were also given points for the following criteria: each 2003 National Institutes of Health (NIH) RLS criteria met; exclusion of low serum ferritin; and exclusion of peripheral neuropathy by neurological examination.Thirty-two articles on drug-induced RLS, 6 articles on drug-induced PLMS, and 15 articles on drug-induced RBD/ RSWA were analyzed.Based on scores < or = 10 and trials of medication reduction/cessation, the strongest evidence available for drug induced RLS are for the following drugs: escitalopram; fluoxetine; L-dopa/carbidopa and pergolide; L-thyroxine; mianserin; mirtazapine; olanzapine; and tramadol. Since none of the PLMS articles assessed PLMI in trials of medication reduction/cessation, the strongest evidence based on scores > or = 10 are for the following drugs: bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Based on scores > or = 10 and/or trials of medication cessation, the strongest evidence for drug induced RBD/ RSWA is for the following drugs: clomipramine, selegiline, and phenelzine.",

Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

A video-polysomnography revealed periodic leg movements (figure) and arousal followed by sleep episodes while standing, rhythmic marching, and falling (videos 1 and 2 on the Neurology ® Web site at [Neurology.org][1]). A reevaluation of his history revealed symptoms compatible with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Rotigotine1 proved very effective, supporting the diagnosis of RLS. Periodic leg movement disorder leading to sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder could also be considered. Automatic behavior denotes severe sleep deprivation2 and may represent a non-REM parasomnia. Severe RLS may present with automatic behavior complicating its diagnosis.

En effet, le syndrome fut decouvert au cours des annees 70 et ce n’est qu’en 1981 que le traitement phare de cette affection fut mis au point : la Pression Positive Continue. Ce traitement permet de controler le symptome caracteristique de cette pathologie qui est la somnolence diurne excessive. On parle de traitement palliatif car il n’y a pas de guerison complete du syndrome. De plus, les etudes demontrent que l’esperance de vie des malades avec ce traitement est quasi equivalente a celle de la population generale. Le syndrome d’apnees du sommeil est un trouble respiratoire nocturne. Il correspond a la repetition d’arret respiratoire, total ou partiel, pendant le sommeil. Il existe plusieurs types d’apnees du sommeil, la forme la plus frequente est l’apnee obstructive du sommeil. Ces arrets sont donc dus a l’obstruction des voies aeriennes superieures empechant l’air d’entrer dans les poumons durant la duree de l’apnee. L’obstruction est liee a un collapsus inspiratoire du pharynx. Ces troubles se repetent plusieurs fois au cours d’une meme nuit avec des durees qui varient de quelques secondes a plusieurs minutes. La reprise de la respiration se fait de facon bruyante s’accompagnant d’un bref eveil, encore appele micro-eveil, non memorise dans la plus part des cas mais dont l’impact perturbe la qualite du sommeil. Cette reprise ventilatoire bruyante est accompagnee de ronflements intenses et quotidiens. Ce sont ces elements qui ! amenent les personnes a consulter et qui oriente le diagnostic. Enfin, le syndrome d’apnees du sommeil est une maladie frequente, evolutive, sournoise dont l’impact au niveau de la qualite de vie n’est pas negligeable. L’interet d’un depistage rapide permettant une prise en charge multidisciplinaire et efficiente de cette maladie chronique est donc necessaire.",

      "abstract": "A widespread network of respiratory-related neurons within the brainstem controls the regular respiratory cycle, which is dependent upon unspecific and specific drives like hypoxia or hypercapnia. This respiratory network and its respiratory drives are subjects to typical changes during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and within the various sleep states, which favor a destabilization of breathing during sleep. There is also a respiratory-related innervation of the dilating and stiffening pharyngeal muscles as well as a local reflex control of the basic tone of upper airway muscles, both of which are influenced by the different states of wakefulness and sleep. These sleep-related changes cause an increase in upper airway resistance during sleep. In healthy subjects, however, these features during sleep are almost completely compensated and the gas exchange is hardly hindered. However, in the case of illness, severe disordered breathing, disturbed gas exchange and interrupted sleep may occur. The central hypoventilation syndrome, central apnea-hypopnea syndromes, as well as the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome belong to these diseases. Because of the intense research, we have a detailed picture of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the origin and the maintenance of sleep-related breathing disorders.",

The consequences include depressed mood, interpersonal irritability, decreased daytime vigilance, weight gain, coronary artery disease, and cognitive impairment (Kecklund and Axelsson 2016). Determining what amount of sleep is sufficient for an individual is difficult for several reasons. Sleep duration gradually decreases from a starting length of 16 hours per 24-hour day as human beings transition from infancy to adulthood. Interindividual differences in the optimal amount of sleep range from 6 to 12 hours, with a mean of 7.5 hours for adults. When a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSAH), is present, the continuity and depth of sleep may be compromised independently of sleep duration. Recognizing how much sleep any individual requires is complicated. Nonetheless, there is consensus that chronically inadequate sleep is detrimental to health.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can be associated with other autonomic system illness, such as Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome) and neuroblastoma.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To describe a case report of sleep related painful erection (SRPE) and review of the literature. Design and Method: We describe our case report and present a comprehensive review of the literature using Pubmed and Medline. Keywords used: sleep-related erection, painful erection, drugs. A 64 year old patient consulted our outpatient clinic with symptoms of erectile dysfunction, history of Peyronie’s disease and SRPE. The symptoms of SRPE started a year ago, at the same time he started taking benzodiazepines due to insomnia. After careful examination we advised to stop this medication. Re-evaluation after 10 days showed resolution of the symptoms with total disappearance of the SRPE. Results: SRPE is a rare sleeping disorder characterized by recurrent, painful penile erections occurring when awakening from REM sleep, while erections are painless during wakefulness. The repeated SRPE-related awakenings lead to REM sleep deprivation, and insomnia with accompanying daytime exhaustion, stress and irritability. Polysomnographic monitoring shows that the SPRE are associated with awakening in REM sleep, and demonstrates a disturbance of sleep stability, an increase in arousals, and instability in the erections which last beyond REM sleep. Unfortunately the pathophysiology of SRPE remains unknown. Previous association with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome therapy (OSAS) is described. It should be noted that the rarity of the published observations probably does not reflect the actual prevalence of the disorder. Conclusions: Patients with SPRE taking benzodiazepines should be counseled to stop this medication.",

      "title": "0617 Working Memory and Psychomotor Vigilance Performance After Brief Naps in Hypersomnolent Patients: MSLT Correlates",
      "abstract": "Physiologic sleep inertia is operationalized as cognitive impairments upon awakening. Markedly pronounced sleep inertia, or sleep drunkenness, is common in idiopathic hypersomnia. Previous work has demonstrated significant worsening of vigilance on Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses (reaction times>500ms), reciprocal of reaction time (RRT) and slowest 10% of RRT associated with nap length and accrued sleep length among hypersomnolent patients during MSLT. A differential sensitivity of various cognitive processes to sleep inertia may be a significant contributing factor to these complaints such as working memory. Patients undergoing PSG/MSLT (N=37; Age=36.42 ± 14.14; 81.09% women), with diagnoses of Idiopathic hypersomnia (n=17), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (n=7), Narcolepsy Type 1 (n=3) and Type 2 (n=2), KLS(n=1) and subjective sleepiness with normal MSLT (n=7) were administered PVT before and after MSLT naps 2 and 4 and 0-back and 3-back N-Back tasks before and after nap 3. Accuracy on the N-Back was defined as correct classification rate of targets and non-targets. PVT and N-back performance was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests. For Nap 4, lapses, RRT, and S-RRT demonstrated significant worsening post-nap relative to pre-nap, (10.47 ± 19.29(pre) vs 15.01 ± 21.15(post),t=2.02,p=0.05); (3.36±.85(pre) vs 2.93 ± 1.01(post),t=-3.97,p=0.0003); (2.03±.79(pre) vs 1.73±.80(post),t=-3.27,t=0.0018), respectively. Nap 4 sleep time, sleep efficiency and accumulated sleep through 4 naps (except for lapses) was significantly associated with lapses, Mean RRT and Mean S-RRT. Accuracy on the 3-Back demonstrated significant improvement post-nap relative to pre-nap, (.61±.25(pre)vs.71±.21(post),t=3.92,p=.0004), and associated with Nap 3 sleep efficiency (B=-.13,SE=.05,p=.011). Similar results for 0-Back accuracy (.78±.27(pre)vs.88±.18(post),t=3.93,p=.0004), and association with Nap 3 sleep efficiency (B=-.14,SE=.04,p=.0008). Reaction Times(ms) for 3 and 0-back demonstrated similar improvement, (1143.36 ± 452.52(pre)vs.1091.06 ± 470.83(post),t=-2.90,p=.006) and (840.11 ± 366.5(pre)vs 832.15 ± 383.3(post),t=3.93,p=.0004), respectively; with 0-back associated with sleep efficiency (B=-.14,SE=.04,p=.0008). Depreciation of psychomotor vigilance is consistent with previous findings, while improvements in working memory performance suggests discriminating the effects and sensitivities of sleep inertia from benefits of sleep-consolidation requires multiple WM tasks in addition to the N-back.

There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

      "abstract": "We report here a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) following initiation of venlafaxine 2 weeks after withdrawal of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), phenelzine, and also following repeated retrials of venlafaxine initiation. The case has clinically important implications regarding the period of time necessary for monoamine oxidase biosynthesis following use of an irreversible MAOI.\r\n\r\nSS is characterized by the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms (such as hyperthermia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, nausea, shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, and diarrhoea), mental status changes (such as agitation, hypomania, and confusion), and neuromuscular abnormalities (such as myoclonus, incoordination, hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus, and muscle rigidity [Sternbach, 2003]). SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

Polysomnogram revealed severe OSA; initiation of CPAP and levothyroxine resulted in immediate improvement. The lack of a previous psychiatric history and acuteness of presentation was consistent with hypothyroid psychosis complicated by sleep deprivation cause by untreated OSA. Primary hypothyroidism is a common disorder often associated with depression. It is rarely associated with psychosis and was first described as \"myxoedematous madness\" in 1949. It has not been previously reported to cause psychosis when associated with obstructive sleep apnea. This case illustrates the need for examination of potential multiple organic causes in a patient who presents with psychosis in the critical care setting.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are associated with a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, and many psychiatric patients report symptoms such as insomnia, tiredness, fatigue, and excessive sleepiness. Despite their known negative impact on daytime functioning and quality of life, less than 10% of individuals with these symptoms visit physicians specifically for their sleeping problems. Although there are many explanations for this lack of reporting, one possibility is that individuals are often unaware of the impact of sleepiness on their daytime functioning. Therefore, the burden of identifying sleepiness and its consequences often resides with physicians and other health care professionals. This process of detection is assisted by rating scales and subjective and objective tests. Although prior discussions on these topics have focused on the understanding and identification of either excessive sleepiness or insomnia, these symptoms often coexist, introducing a clinical challenge in that it becomes unclear which of these two should become the initial focus of clinical attention. When both excessive sleepiness and insomnia coexist, a circadian rhythm sleep disorder may be present, such as jet lag type, delayed and advanced sleep phase types, and shift work type.",

      "title": "Bruxism Decoded: A Case Report Revealing the Invisible Signs",
      "abstract": "Bruxism is characterized by involuntary movements involving teeth grinding or clenching. It is perceived as a parafunctional activity, and it can lead to instability and various consequences such as dental wear, musculoskeletal pain, masseter hypertrophy, persistent fatigue, and tension headaches. According to the time of occurrence, it can be classified as awake bruxism and/or sleep bruxism. This case report describes a 19-year-old woman, who presented to her family doctor with shoulder pain, headaches, and persistent tiredness despite apparent adequate sleep. She reported no other symptoms and denied any trauma or physical exertion. Her past medical history included anxiety disorder, treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and irregular follow-ups with psychology and psychiatry throughout the years. The only relevant findings on the physical examination were cervical and shoulder tenderness, without functional impairment, along with noticeable wear on dental surfaces, consistent with bruxism. Further history of overall behaviour was compatible with both sleep and awake bruxism, exacerbated during periods of increased anxiety. The SSRI dose was increased, and a muscle relaxant was prescribed. A referral was made to both psychology and dentistry. After two weeks, a reduction in anxiety, headaches, and musculoskeletal pain was observed, with only sporadic use of the muscle relaxant. A dental splint was prescribed following dental evaluation, resulting in significant clinical improvement: better anxiety control, improved sleep quality, occasional musculoskeletal complaints, and reduced headaches. Although the patient did not initially complain of bruxism, the presence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity with repetitive contractions and increased muscle tension highlighted the need to identify this condition as a clinical target for intervention and treatment. Early diagnosis is essential to minimize complications and prevent symptom dispersion. Otherwise, bruxism may be overlooked as a central diagnosis, and treatment opportunities may be missed. Given its multifactorial aetiology, management must be multidisciplinary, as demonstrated in this case.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

Neuropeptides are common regulators of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and nocturnal hormone secretion and changes in their activity appear to contribute to the aberrances of sleep in affective disorders. A reciprocal interaction of the sleep-promoting growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which promotes wakefulness and REM sleep, plays a key role in sleep regulation, at least in male subjects. Also galanin and ghrelin promote sleep in men. Neuropeptide Y is involved in the timing of sleep onset. The effects of peptides of sleep are influenced by the time of administration, age, gender and depression. In healthy subjects and in remitted depressed patients motoric memory learning is consolidated during sleep. This effect is absent in depressed patients who are at least 30 years old, and is probably related to elevated glucocorticoid levels.",

L’enuresie nocturne (plus de 2 fois par semaine) toucherait 8 % des enfants de moins de 4 ans et demi et 1,5 % des enfants de moins de 9 ans et demi. Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "title": "RELAPSE: Answers to Why a Patient Is Having a New Mood Episode",
      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "Melatonin for Sundown Syndrome and Delirium in Dementia: Is It Effective?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The terms \"sundown syndrome\" or \"sundowning\" are used to describe a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in individuals with dementia in the late afternoon, evening, or night.1 These symptoms include confusion, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, aggression, pacing, wandering, screaming, yelling, and hallucinations. The treatment of sundown syndrome is challenging, and pharmacological therapies are not particularly effective. An 81-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 4 years previously was admitted to the elderly department because of behavioral disturbances, sleep disorders, and wandering. His wife said that his cognitive and functional impairments had gradually worsened over the past 4 years and that, in the last 6 months, her husband had become verbally aggressive, agitated, and restless; wandered; and paced. He did not sleep for long and had difficulty falling asleep. The symptoms increased in the late afternoon and at night. He had no hallucinations or delusions. One month before admission, delirium was suspected, and his general practitioner prescribed haloperidol, but it was not effective. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. He scored 8 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (indicating severe cognitive impairment) and 50 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (indicating severe behavioral disturbances). Blood and urine test results were normal. During admission, sundown syndrome was diagnosed, and he received pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and sleep disturbances, but none was effective, and some aggravated symptoms. The pharmacological interventions consisted of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants, all given in an optimal dosing schedule. After extensive review of his history, the effect of past treatments, and the published literature, melatonin was started at a dose of 2 mg at 8:00 p.m. for sleep disorders. Not only did his sleep quality improve within a week, but there was also significant improvement in his behavior within 2 hours of initiation of melatonin. A therapeutic trial with an additional dose of 2 mg given at 3:00 p.m. was started, and his symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent 2 weeks (NPI score 20). No behavioral changes were observed in the 2-month follow-up. The prevalence of sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia is estimated to be 2.4% to 66%.1 This wide variation is primarily due to the numerous definitions of the disorder. Several studies have reported that the circadian rhythm, which melatonin regulates, may be an important factor contributing to sundown syndrome.2, 3 Melatonin secretion is low or dysregulated in individuals with dementia, with levels of melatonin detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of controls being almost five times as high as those in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.3, 4 In addition, previous randomized controlled trials and case series have found that melatonin significantly improves sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia.5-7 All of these studies had some limitations, such as different definitions of sundown syndrome, small sample size, different settings (home, hospital), and various dosages of melatonin. One study reported that melatonin (n = 24; placebo, n = 17) did not significantly affect sleep, circadian rhythms, or agitation in individuals with dementia.8 It is important to differentiate sundown syndrome from delirium because of differences in treatment and prognosis. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of changes in cognition and behavior, a fluctuating course during the day, and an altered level of consciousness.9 In general, it can be caused by a medical condition, drug or substance intoxication, or withdrawal.9 Delirium may gradually improve as the primary problem resolves or the medical condition becomes stable. Sundown syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset or exacerbation of the usual behaviors that occur every day at the same time, in the late afternoon, evening, or night. Although it has been suggested that physiological and environmental factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, no cause is typically found in most individuals.1 The pharmacological interventions for delirium are better documented than those for sundown syndrome. Sundown syndrome and delirium share many symptoms, but it is not known whether they share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, although the circadian rhythm pathway is implicated in both conditions.2, 3, 10 It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion is associated with postoperative delirium in elderly adults,10 but only two articles were found on the efficacy of melatonin as treatment for delirium in the literature.11, 12 The first reported two cases;11 one was a 53-year-old man successfully treated with melatonin for severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and the second was a 78-year-old man with a history of postoperative delirium who was given melatonin to prevent another episode of postoperative delirium. He did not develop postoperative delirium on melatonin. The second article reported that low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg/d) given every night for 14 days or until discharge was associated with lower risk of delirium than placebo in elderly adults (n = 72; mean age 84.5).12 Further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of melatonin in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Until then, melatonin could be considered a treatment option, especially in individuals who fail to respond to other interventions.

Patients with RLS describe an urge to move their legs, especially in the evenings and during periods of inactivity. The prevalence of clinically significant RLS is approximately 2% to 3% in adults in Europe and North America. RLS can be an independent disorder or may occur in conjunction with other conditions (eg, iron deficiency, pregnancy, chronic renal failure). Diagnosis is based on clinical history. Routine polysomnography typically is not recommended unless there is suspicion of other sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Management includes a combination of supportive measures, dopaminergic drugs, gabapentinoids, opioids, or benzodiazepines. Good sleep hygiene can help prevent development of insomnia related to RLS. Avoiding alcohol and reducing caffeine intake is recommended. If iron stores are low, iron supplementation may improve symptoms. The main pharmacologic options for RLS management are dopaminergic agonists (eg, pramipexole and ropinirole); gabapentinoids also are good options. Patients may experience augmentation, an increase in RLS symptom severity with increasing drug dosage, which is the main complication of dopaminergic drugs. There is no evidence to support use of vibratory devices that provide stimulation to the lower extremities.",

Typical CSWS starts at an age of 4 to 5 years and ends by an average of 11 years. We report on an unexpected finding of CSWS in an 18-month-old male whose previous EEG at age 45 days was grossly abnormal with the presence of a burst suppression pattern during wakefulness and sleep. The patient had clinical seizures beginning day 1 of life leading to the suspicion of Ohtahara syndrome (the earliest form of epileptic encephalopathy). Patients with ESES usually have normal EEGs and functional development prior to the onset of CSWS pattern. To our knowledge, this presentation of a neonate with a history of neonatal seizures and developmental delay with an evolution to CSWS has not been described. A sleep record is strongly advised in children with epilepsy (despite the recording of awake EEG abnormalities), especially in patients with behavior or cognitive regression, to rule out the presence of CSWS.",

The differential diagnosis of sleepwalking includes partial complex seizures occurring during sleep, rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder, night terrors, malingering, dissociative phenomena and medication effects. The treatment of sleepwalking in children includes providing a regular sleep-wake schedule, ensuring that the child has sufficient sleep and reassuring the parents.

      "abstract": "Sleepis one of the best-documented factors influencing the expression of seizuresand interictal discharges. Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

It is also useful when studying patients with hypersomnia or disorders of the wakefulness-sleep cycle.

The Society of Behavioural Sleep Medicine (www.behavioralsleep.org) and the American Board of Sleep Medicine also approved this type of treatment for Insomnia.",

Some parasomnias, such as sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations, are part of the classic tetrad of narcolepsy, but are encountered as isolated phenomena in an extremely high proportion of the otherwise normal population. Others are much less commonly experienced or encountered, but a knowledge of these conditions often permits a rapid diagnosis. This chapter discusses a range of other parasomnias that may occasionally be encountered in clinical practice, including rhythmic movement disorder, hypnic jerks, exploding head syndrome and propriospinal myoclonus.",

The arousal is accompanied by a snort or loud snoring (inspiration against a partially obstructed upper airway).

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

From the day of deprivation - in the self-rating from the 4th day - up to 1 week later a therapeutic effect can be observed. The psychic part of the symptomatology was more reduced than the somatic one. Compared to total and partial SD during the 2nd half of the night, there is, on average, a smaller therapeutic effect which occurs later. The diurnal variation of the depressive symptomatology is less influenced. According to the period without sleep, the circadian course of the heart rate is less and differently modified by SD during the 1st half of the night. Only an existing diurnal variation (before SD) is a predictor of the prompt effect. Implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic SD were discussed. For clinical practice, SD during the 2nd half of the night is the method of choice.",

      "abstract": "A review of the sleep of 31 patients 45 years old or older undergoing nocturnal penile tumescence studies showed that 19 had a previously undiagnosed sleep disorder. Of the patients 9 had periodic leg movements in sleep, 9 had sleep apnea and 1 had both disorders. In 10 of these patients the sleep disorders affected nocturnal penile tumescence by disrupting sleep and causing brief periods of detumescence, movement artifacts and delays in the tumescing phase of nocturnal penile tumescence. These disruptions resulted in an apparently abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence that appeared as if the patient had difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection. The nocturnal penile tumescence disruptions may have reflected only a disruption of the necessary conditions for normal nocturnal penile tumescence to occur, namely adequate sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. The results strongly suggest that failure to measure concurrent sleep parameters and screen for occult sleep disorders could result in the incorrect diagnosis of abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence.",

O objetivo deste estudo foi revisar a literatura quanto às consequências individuais, econômicas e sociais causadas pela SAOS.

Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares. A SAOS deveria ser considerada uma doença de saúde pública, dados seus inequívocos prejuízos individuais, sociais e econômicos.

Two broad types of insomnia may often be distinguished: (1) difficulty falling asleep and frequent wakening, characteristic of anxiety states or obsessive worrying; and (2) early morning wakening, sometimes in a panic, suggestive of endogenous depression. The first group of patients respond well to minor tranquilizers and psychotherapy, whereas the second do well with tricyclic anti-depressants. Many studies in sleep laboratories have declineated the stages and cycles of sleep physiology and pathology, especially the importance of REM or dreaming sleep. The clinician should be cautious in the use of hypnotics like barbiturates which suppress REM sleep and produce a rebound increase on withdrawal, as well as problems of dependence of habituation. Flurazepam and chloral hydrate are considerably safer in this respect. Understanding sleep neurophysiology and biochemistry permits appropriate individual clinical management for both psychiatric patients and medical patients with conditions like peptic ulcer and nocturnal angina pectoris.",

D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil.

These disorders can lead to events related to the sympathetic stimulation and hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The bidirectional relationships between OSAHS and metabolic abnormalities directly affect the prognosis of OSAHS.

A 24-year-old previously healthy male presented with psychosis, acute personality changes, auditory and visual hallucinations three weeks after falling 15 feet with concurrent head trauma. A right-sided cerebral contusion with concussion was diagnosed on initial admission with increasing homicidal and suicidal ideations after 26 hours of insomnia. The patient accomplished rest after seven days of medication-resistant insomnia with the final combination of ziprasidone and lorazepam. After one night of sleep, the patient was alert and oriented with normal mood, affect, and cognition. The insomnia appeared to exacerbate this patient's symptoms, and an atypical insomnia treatment regimen was required to induce somnolence and restore function in this patient. The combination of this abnormal patient presentation along with the unorthodox medication regimen makes this case unique compared to other traumatic brain injury symptoms and treatments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "title": "Sleep of paradoxes",
      "abstract": "In this issue of The Journal of Physiology, Morrell et al. report their findings from a study of the response of human subjects to inspiratory resistive loading during sleep and wakefulness. At issue is a question of physiology in sleep that is important for understanding the pathophysiology of the obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. These patients, and they are numerous, have recurring apnoeas during sleep. The apnoeas produce arousals that save the patient but disrupt sleep and cause excessive daytime sleepiness. They also produce repeated hypoxic episodes that lead to pulmonary and systemic hypertension. Most or all cases are the result of some anomaly in the structure of the upper airway that predisposes it to collapse in response to the negative pressure of inspiration. To the physiologist, one question is ‘Why does the airway collapse only in sleep?’ or ‘Why does it not collapse in wakefulness?‘. There are several possibilities. Perhaps impending collapse is not sensed by the sleeping brain. Or perhaps it is sensed but a response is prevented. Or perhaps it has nothing to do with either of these and the problem is avoided in wakefulness but not in sleep because of differences in endogenous drive to airway dilating muscles in these states. For example, some have suggested that there is an endogenous drive that depends on wakefulness. In support of this idea, stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular activating system causes desynchronization of the electroencephalogram (arousal) and also causes an increase in the rate and depth of breathing and, perhaps more to the point of obstructive sleep apnoea, a preferential activation of muscles that dilate the upper airways (Orem & Lydic, 1978). Morrell et al. (2000) studied normal subjects, not patients with sleep apnoea, and they were interested in whether or not there was respiratory load compensation during sleep. In wakefulness, compensation is evident as a lengthened duration of inspiration and increase in tidal volume on the first breath following imposition of a load. The circuitry for the immediate prolongation of inspiration, that is, the sensory receptors, and central comparator that detects the difference between what was intended and what was achieved, is not known, but whatever the details, it involves sensory and motor limbs linked by central structures into a complex reflex. The authors findings for both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep were of interest. In REM sleep, but not NREM sleep, there was a prolongation of inspiration (but a decrease in tidal volume) on the first breath following the imposition of a resistance to breathing. The NREM sleep results (negative findings) are noteworthy because homeostasis is considered optimal in that state (Parmeggiani, 1980). For example, animals pant in response to high temperatures and shiver in the cold, and responses to changes in blood gases are easily demonstrated. The REM sleep results are noteworthy because homeostasis is absent in that state (Parmeggiani, 1980). Reflexes are variable and seem to depend on whether or not the brain is engaged with something endogenous such as the content of the dream or a primal pontine drive. Morrell et al. (2000) provide an interesting interpretation of this paradox of sleep states. Noting that there is desynchronization (excitation) of the EEG in both REM sleep and wakefulness, but not NREM sleep, they suggest that the response to a resistive load requires endogenous excitation. Thus, they come down clearly on the side of the idea that response to a load depends on the excitatory drives endemic to the state. Enigmas of REM sleep prevail throughout the work of Morrell et al. (2000). The search for differences in the response to a load in tonic versus phasic REM sleep led them to unexpected results and ultimately to the question of the validity of the tonic-phasic distinction. The accompanying Fig. 1 from our experiments is offered as support for their skepticism. It shows two specific indices of REM sleep, firing frequency of a medullary neuron that was active only in REM sleep and frequency of pontogeniculo-occipital (PGO) waves, in relation to three respiratory parameters (diaphragmatic activity, respiration period and range of respiration periods) during two REM sleep periods, A and B. Although at times PGO activity and the discharge rate of the REM-specific cell are related to each other and/or to one or more of the respiratory parameters, at other times they are not. In A (during the last minute of this REM sleep period), but not B, the discharge rate of the REM-specific neuron is highly correlated with diaphragmatic activity. In B but not A, PGO wave activity and REM-specific neuronal activity are correlated with the rate and irregularity of breathing. It is evident from the constantly varying parameters and their fleeting relations that REM sleep belongs to a multi-dimensional continuum that is not divisible into just two components of tonic and phasic REM sleep. Two periods of REM sleep (A and B) in a cat EMGdia, integrated diaphragmatic activity; Unit rate, activity of REM specific neuron in the medullary reticular formation; PGO waves rate, frequency of PGO waves; Ttot, breath duration; ΔTtot=Ttot,max–Ttot,min, difference between the shortest and longest breaths in a sliding 10 s period.",

      "title": "Severe Sleep Deprivation Causes Hallucinations and a Gradual Progression Toward Psychosis With Increasing Time Awake",
      "abstract": "Background: Going without sleep for long periods of time can produce a range of experiences, including perceptual distortions and hallucinations. Many questions, however, remain unanswered regarding the types of symptoms which are most reliably elicited, the time of symptom onset, and whether symptoms worsen over time towards psychotic decompensation. Since sleep deprivation exceeding 48 h is considered unethical today, an examination of historical studies with extreme sleep-loss duration is needed to obtain information about what happens during prolonged sleep loss. Methods: A systematic-review approach was used to identify experimental and observational studies of sleep deprivation in healthy people which describe the effects of prolonged sleep loss on psychopathological symptoms, without any date restriction. Results: A total of 476 articles were identified. Of these, 21 were eligible for inclusion. Duration of sleep loss ranged between 24 h and 11 nights (total 760 participants; average 72-92 h without sleep). All studies except one reported perceptual changes, including visual distortions (i.e., metamorphopsias), illusions, somatosensory changes and, in some cases, frank hallucinations. The visual modality was the most consistently affected (in 90% of the studies), followed by the somatosensory (52%) and auditory (33%) modalities. Symptoms rapidly developed after one night without sleep, progressing in an almost fixed time-dependent way. Perceptual distortions, anxiety, irritability, depersonalisation, and temporal disorientation started within 24-48 h of sleep loss, followed by complex hallucinations and disordered thinking after 48-90 h, and delusions after 72 h, after which time the clinical picture resembled that of acute psychosis or toxic delirium. By the third day without sleep, hallucinations in all three sensory modalities were reported. A period of normal sleep served to resolve psychotic symptoms in many - although not all - cases. Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms develop with increasing time awake, from simple visual/somatosensory misperceptions to hallucinations and delusions, ending in a condition resembling acute psychosis. These experiences are likely to resolve after a period of sleep, although more information is required to identify factors which can contribute to the prevention of persistent symptoms.",

Brain systems involved in the regualtion of sleep may also play a role in the initiation of vascular headache. Some of the physiological alterations in sleep, particularly REM sleep, are similar to those described in vascular headache. Clinical studies have documented an association between vascular headache and sleep, and headache is a common symptom of sleep disorders. Sleep and headache are known to be interrelated in several ways. It can be summarized as follows: 1) sleep-related headaches, 2) sleep phase-related headaches, 3) length of sleep(excess, lack, and disruption) and headaches, 4) headache related to sleep associated behavior, 5) sleep disorders and headaches, 6) effects of headaches on sleep, and 7) dreams and headaches. Several mechanisms can be proposed to explain the relationship between sleep and headaches.",

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition Abstract The syndrome of continuous spike and waves discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS) is a rare form of age-related epilepsy. Onset occurs between ages 3 and 7 years, and rarely before 2 years. In the absence of brain lesions, CSWSS syndrome occurs in normally developing children. Partial or generalized seizures are rare and occur while the child is falling asleep. Cognitive functions are subsequently altered and behavioural disorders are often seen. The initial neuropsychological deficits affecting a specific cognitive function such as language, gesture or constructive abilities, attention span or behaviour control are often wrongly attributed to psychological problems. The best known cognitive deficit is aphasia. Acquired epileptic aphasia, the Landau and Kleffner syndrome, has been named after the authors who described it in 1957. EEG anomalies are always present. During wakefulness, EEG recordings show focal paroxysmal spike and wave discharges. During slow sleep, spikes and waves become generalized and continuous, occupying over 85% of sleep. There are no concomitant motor seizures, but cognitive impairments progress. With antiepileptic drugs, the EEG becomes normal and neuropsychological status improves with antiepileptic drugs. Epileptic seizures always disappear with adolescence but neuropsychological sequelae may persist. There is no specific treatment with durable effects on the seizures and neuropsychological disorders. Management of CSWSS syndrome requires teams specialized in pediatric epilepsy and neuropsychology.",

The present review aims to discuss body rhythms, body rhythms disorders, and their energetics. Diurnal rhythms occur during the day and in resting, or inactivity at night, circadian rhythms complete one cycle in 24 hours and known as midday activity, ultradian are recurrent or repeated cycle in 24 hours, infradian rhythms complete one cycle more than one day, and circannual rhythms complete their cycle in 24 hours or one year. Body rhythms are following disorders like delayed sleep phase syndrome, altered Sleep, phase Shift Work Dysfunction, and circadian rhythm nap defects. Body rhythm control stress, lighten body load, exercise, avoid smoking, restrict sleeping, avoid napping during the day, provide energy for eating, and limit alcohol consumption. Body rhythms play an important role to regulate the body, while disturbance in body rhythms leads to several disorders.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

It is unlikely that the therapeutic mechanisms of amphetamines in MBDS are exerted on or reflected in physiological sleep patterns. Neither MBDS children nor normal young adults showed withdrawal elevations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep after administration of amphetamines in constant dosage. Young adults showed REM rebounds only when the dosage was increased prior to withdrawal. In contrast to sedative-hypnotics, stimulant drugs do not reduce eye movement activity during REM sleep. This difference is emphasized for the specificity hypothesis-that different classes of psychoactive drugs differentially alter physiological sleep patterns—would be untenable if sedatives and stimulants produced the same effects on sleep.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than the general population. Moreover, the profile of depressive disorder is often atypical in patients with epilepsy. Data from human and animal studies have tended to point towards a bidirectional link in the pathophysiological basis of both epilepsy and depressive syndrome. Depressive symptoms in epilepsy can be divided into those occurring in the peri-ictal period (pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal), and those occurring in the inter-ictal period. Peri-ictal depressive disorders are particularly associated with temporal lobe epilepsies. These include: (i) peri-ictal dysphoria, (symptoms occur in the 24 hour period preceding a seizure); (ii) ictal depression, (symptoms develop during the seizure); (iii) post-ictal depression, (symptoms occur in the 72 hours following the seizure). The inter-ictal depressive disorders are not temporally related to seizures. The best characterized of these is ‘‘inter-ictal dysphoric disorder’’. This includes labile depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anergia, pain, insomnia), labile affective symptoms (panic-like symptoms and anxiety), and supposedly ‘‘specific’’ symptoms (paroxysmal irritability and instable-euphoric moods). Standard psychiatric classification may be inadequate to describe some of the atypical profiles seen in this patient population. Depression in patients with epilepsy is therefore under-diagnosed, and yet contributes to poorer quality of life, epilepsy outcome and risk of suicide. It is recommended that an appropriate screening tool be used to detect signs of major depression, the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Clinicians should recognize the characteristics of peri-ictal and inter-ictal depressive syndromes. 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is approximately 3% in children. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common cause of OSAS in children, and obesity, hypotonic neuromuscular diseases, and craniofacial anomalies are other major risk factors. Snoring is the most common presenting complaint in children with OSAS, but the clinical presentation varies according to age. Agitated sleep with frequent postural changes, excessive sweating, or abnormal sleep positions such as hyperextension of neck or abnormal prone position may suggest a sleep-disordered breathing. Night terror, sleepwalking, and enuresis are frequently associated, during slow-wave sleep, with sleep-disordered breathing. Excessive daytime sleepiness becomes apparent in older children, whereas hyperactivity or inattention is usually predominant in younger children. Morning headache and poor appetite may also be present. As the cortical arousal threshold is higher in children, arousals are not easily developed and their sleep architectures are usually more conserved than those of adults. Untreated OSAS in children may result in various problems such as cognitive deficits, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, poor academic achievement, and emotional instability. Mild pulmonary hypertension is not uncommon. Rarely, cardiovascular complications such as cor pulmonale, heart failure, and systemic hypertension may develop in untreated cases. Failure to thrive and delayed development are serious problems in younger children with OSAS. Diagnosis of pediatric OSAS should be based on snoring, relevant history of sleep disruption, findings of any narrow or collapsible portions of upper airway, and confirmed by polysomnography. Early diagnosis of pediatric OSAS is critical to prevent complications with appropriate interventions. Key words: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Child, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Sequelae",

      "title": "Micturition reflex epilepsy with tonic seizures – A rare semiology with insights from magnetoencephalography",
      "abstract": "Reflex epilepsy is a condition, wherein epileptic seizures are triggered by specific stimuli such as flashing lights, music, reading etc. Stimuli may be exogenous (sensory) or endogenous (e.g.: praxis induced, solving calculations). Very rarely, the act of urination can set off seizures and this may often be confused with micturition syncope, when loss of consciousness occurs early. Our patient is a 5-year-old boy who was born to non-consanguineous parents by normal delivery. He had a smooth perinatal transit and an unremarkable first year of life. He had delay in acquisition of language milestones and began to speak bi-syllables by 2.5 years of life. Development in other domains was relatively normal. At the age of 4 years, he was noticed to have brief episodes of posturing of his upper limbs with up-rolling of eyes during sleep. These events lasted for a few seconds and occurred 5–6 times during the night. The child was treated with sodium valproate (SVA) and levetiracetam (LEV) at weight appropriate doses elsewhere. Despite good compliance, he continued to suffer from daily nocturnal brief tonic seizures. About 4 months into the illness, he developed another symptom. When the child commences to urinate, he loses consciousness and slumps to the floor. His mother reported that his limbs appeared to be tightly held in extension and his eyes looked to the right. This phenomenon occurred when child urinated in both sitting and standing position. The possibilities considered were micturition induced reflex seizures vs. micturition syncope. In view of pre-existing developmental delay and co-existing nocturnal seizures, the former differential diagnosis appeared to be more likely. His scalp EEG showed a posterior dominant rhythm of 4−5 Hz. He had frequent spikes in the right temporal (F8, T4) and frontocentral (FC) regions (F4,C4) and rare spikes in the left FC leads (F3,C3). To precisely characterize the nature of his symptoms, he underwent video-EEG telemetry. A total of 6 stereotyped events were recorded, all during micturition. Within a few seconds of starting to urinate, the child had slow neck flexion, looked to the right side with eye version to the right and had posturing of his upper limbs (right in extension and left in flexion). Its counterpart ictal EEG showed low amplitude fast activity in the midline centroparietal leads which increased in amplitude and culminated into bilateral centroparietal slowing towards the end of the attack. He regained consciousness 10 s after the cessation of ictal activity (Fig. 2). EKG recording during the ictus did not show any alteration in rhythm. It is likely that these seizures were originating from near the midline, possibly from the left hemisphere. Given that the micturition centers are also in the mesial frontal regions, this finding is not surprising. MRI done with a 3 T scanner was normal and PET-MRI did not show any areas of focal hypometabolism (Fig. 1a, ). Interictal MEG showed equivalent current dipoles clustered in the left midline posterior parietal region just above the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Though this is an interictal finding, it appears to be concordant with the hypothesis generated from VEEG. LEV was tapered and was prescribed lamotrigine (3 mg/kg) along with SVA (25 mg/kg). There was complete cessation of both reflex and non-reflex nocturnal seizures for the past 9 months.Fig. 2Clinical semiology and ictal EEG.Show full captiona. Clinical semiology b.

Micturition is a complex physiological process which is controlled by the spinal cord, brainstem and the cortex. The higher centers for micturition lie in the pons, periaqueductal grey, mesial frontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Though the exact mechanism of reflex seizures during urination has not been elucidated, one might intuitively assume that mesial frontal activation could set off seizures in susceptible individuals. An ictal EEG and ictal PET study from Japan [[1]Okumura A. Kondo Y. Tsuji T. Ikuta T. Negoro T. Kato K. et al.Micturition induced seizures: ictal EEG and subtraction ictal SPECT findings.Epilepsy Res. 2007; 73: 119-121https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] observed changes in the mesial frontal region in the ictal PET scan. Clinical semiology was also suggestive of ictal onset from the left supplementary motor area. Only a handful of cases have been reported in literature, whose clinical features have been reviewed [[2]Jang H.-J. Kwon M.J. Cho K.-O. Central Regulation of Micturition and Its Association With Epilepsy.Int Neurourol J. 2018; 22: 2-8https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.1836040.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Interestingly most patients have co-existing neuro-developmental issues. Seizure onset though commonly is seen in the midline in EEGs, case reports have mentioned other areas of EEG changes namely frontotemporal and occipital regions. Semiology and ictal EEG similar to our patient has been reported from another center in southern India [[3]Rathore C. Teaching Video NeuroImage: Electroclinical characteristics of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Neurology. 2008; 70: 20https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000312283.88683.0dCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. In another study, urodynamic testing during the ictus identified detrusor over activity [[4]Seth J.H. McLaughlin C. Eriksson S. Fowler C.J. Walker M.C. Panicker J.N. Blackouts in the toilet: a case of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Pract Neurol. 2014; 14: 261-263https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2013-000733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. To the best of our knowledge, no MEG data in this type of reflex epilepsy is currently available in literature. The MEG cluster has localized to the midline left parietal region, which is posterior to the 'known micturition center' in the frontal region. The interictal MEG corresponds fairly to the region ictal EEG onset. It may only be hypothesized that this region is closely networked with the frontal micturition center. This case highlights an unusual semiology of asymmetric tonic seizures during micturition in a child with mild developmental delay and normal imaging. Overall, VEEG and MEG has suggested the role of midline structures possibly in the left parietal region. The importance of video-telemetry is emphasized, as it can help differentiate between epileptic seizures vs non-epileptic conditions. Lamotrigine and valproate combination resulted in sustained seizure freedom for 9 months. Further studies are required to elucidate treatment algorithms for these patients, but may be cumbersome as this condition is exceedingly rare.",

Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of apneic spells during different sleep states, active sleep, quiet sleep, and undifferentiated sleep was determined in eight preterm infants of 30 to 35 weeks' conceptional age, by means of a polygraphic recording technique. They were free of perinatal and postnatal complications other than apnea. During their active or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep they showed significantly more apneic episodes which were also longer lasting and they were accompanied by bradycardia of a greater severity. The organization of the immature nervous system with a preponderance of inhibitory synaptic connections and the additional inhibition of spinal motoneurons during REM sleep are likely to be the cause of apneic spells in otherwise \"normal\" preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

The major complications are localised cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage (22%) and parenchymal ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes (7%) which may leave permanent sequelae. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of the “string of beads” appearance of cerebral arteries on angiography, with complete or almost complete resolution on repeat angiography 12 weeks after onset.

      "title": "Dreaming during REM sleep: autobiographically meaningful or a simple reflection of a Hebb'ian-based memory consolidation process?",
      "abstract": "REM sleep is a state of desynchronized electrophysiological activity of the brain. It is usually accompanied by mental activity characterized by a succession of complex visual experiences commonly referred to as dreaming. Although REM sleep and dreaming are not implicitly conjoined, when they co-occur, they have a very distinct phenomenology, as, typically, the dream plot is bizarre and incohesive which is mirrored in heightened brain activation coupled with strongly attenuated coherence levels. At the same time, owing to increased limbic system activity, REM sleep dreams are highly emotional. Moreover, concrete emotions are often unrelated to dream events. Nevertheless, REM sleep dreams are often subjectively perceived as story-like and autobiographically meaningful. Indeed, elements of salient life events, attachment figures, and personally relevant emotions, especially trauma, seem to have a higher probability of re-appearing in dreams, albeit the dream plot itself remains highly distorted. This has prompted several theories on the interpretability of dreams, some authors leaning towards dreams reflecting waking mentation, others suggesting complete dissociation between waking and dreaming, both sides not fully accounting for empirical findings. In this review, we provide an overview of recent findings on the factors mediating REM sleep neurophysiology and dream content. As a first step towards integration of conflicting research results, we introduce a testable model (Trace-Spur-model) based on Hebb'ian theory of neural networks, proposing that dream bizarreness is a function of state-related modulations in synaptic strength allowing for hyper-associative mental activity, possibly enabling either a restructuring and integrative consolidation or extinction of learning experiences acquired in waking. In this model, dreams are viewed as phenomenological expressions of this neurophysiologic activity where dream recall allows a fragmentary witnessing of such processes, similar to peeking into an enduring and complex networking system. However, the content of the recollected dream is probably strongly deterred by autobiographical memory bias, favoring those images we can form some sort of association with.",

OSAS involves the existence of at least 5 breathing breaks of at least 10 seconds in a sleeping hour. OSAS etiologic factors are numerous, the most important being the increased body weight of patients (a high percentage of 50% of patients with OSAS with different degrees of obesity), age (OSAS is diagnosed in middle-aged people), craniofacial deformities, multiple pathologies leading to narrowing of the upper airways, gender (is more common in men), genetic causes (more common in black and Hispanic people), alcohol, tobacco, hypnotic and sedative medications. Symptoms of OSAS are characterized by daytime and night-time symptoms. Of the daytime symptoms, patients frequently report headache and morning fatigue, daytime somnolence, memory impairment and concentration. Of the nocturnal symptoms, the most common symptoms experienced by patients are snoring and repeated episodes of apnea. Patients also report nocturia, polakiuria, decreased libido, symptoms that are often attributed to other pathologies. Due to concentration disturbances and low cognitive performance among patients with OSAS, they will experience a decrease in work capacity, which is reflected by the loss of work, reflected by the decrease in the number of working days. OSAS treatment is complex, different depending on the severity of the disease and the existing comorbidities of the patient.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is multifactorial, associated with inadequate cardiac, breathing, autonomic and/or arousal control. Although cases are usually found collapsed in the early hours of the morning, collapse can occur in daytime. If resuscitation is successful, these infants may die later (delayed SIDS). In these circumstances, hypoxic ischaemic injury to vital organs, including the central nervous system will likely develop: haemorrhages (subdural (SDH), intradural, subgaleal, subarachnoid and/or brain), oedema, spinal and/or retinal haemorrhages (RH). The SDH and encephalopathy are well described in young infants dying of natural causes, especially following successful advanced resuscitation. Infants who develop the triad of SDH, RH, and encephalopathy share many epidemiological features with infants dying of SIDS: age, male sex, prematurity, small for gestational age, young mothers, multiple births, high parity, low socioeconomic status, smoking during pregnancy, minor respiratory infections. Hence, it seems reasonable to hypothesise that there is an overlap between some features in SIDS and SBS, and that the latter may correspond to a resuscitated SIDS.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved. Mrs. Neylan (Brandon General Hospital School of Nursing, Manitoba, Canada; B.N., McGill University) is senior lecturer at the University of British Columbia School of Nursing in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.",

      "title": "The Diagnostic Value of the Sleep EEG With and Without Sleep Deprivation in Patients With Atypical Absences",
      "abstract": "Summary: Hitherto it has not been known whether or not the sleep EEG after sleep deprivation is more effective than the simple or drug‐induced sleep EEG. To investigate this, we recorded for 32 patients both sleep EEGs without sleep deprivation and, on the following day, sleep EEGs after 24 h of sleep deprivation. All the patients had atypical absences which were almost exclusively combined with generalized seizures or some other seizure types. All patients were receiving antiepileptic therapy. Sleep without sleep deprivation was induced by oral administration of 2 mg/kg body weight Protactyl® (promazine hydrochloride). In patients showing no epileptic activity in the routine EEG, epileptic discharges could be provoked in 78% without sleep deprivation and in 72% after sleep deprivation. Epileptic activity was already seen in 28.1% of the cases in the awake EEG without sleep deprivation, recorded immediately before the sleep EEG, and in 50% of the cases in the awake EEG after sleep deprivation. It is unlikely that promazine hydrochloride in the dose used here has an additional inherent provocative effect. Generalized spike‐and‐wave complexes or sharp slow wave complexes which were combined twice with foci and runs of rapid spikes were recorded. In the sleep EEG without sleep deprivation, epileptic discharges were seen in the somewhat shallower stages (C → A→ B → D) and, in the sleep EEG after sleep deprivation, in the somewhat deeper stages (D → C → B → A). Fewer epileptic discharges were elicited in patients who were older at the time of their first seizure. The illness was mild in patients whose sleep EEGs showed no epileptic activity. It is concluded that, as a rule, it is not necessary to record an EEG after sleep deprivation in patients with atypical absences whose routine EEGs show no epileptic activity; the drug‐induced sleep EEG shows the same provocative effect.",

      "abstract": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in the hours or days after the cessation of alcohol drinking in an alcohol dependent patient. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

There are few or no objective findings that might explain the \"disease\" or the complaints go beyond what is regarded as \"reasonable\" by the physician. Muscle pain and other types of subjective health complaints are among the most frequent reason for encounters with general practitioners, and one of the major causes for sickness absence. The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required. The difficult thing is that this threshold is individual and subjective. The psychiatric definitions of these complaints, therefore, refer only to the tip of an iceberg.",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

More severe sleep difficulties have been found to be clearly related to psychiatric illness such as depression and phobias, as well as to addiction. Somnipathies can objectively be identified by means of polygraphy. Overall, polysomnographic measures in patients with affective disorders differ most frequently and significantly from those in normal control subjects. Persistent sleep disturbances are associated with significant risk of both relapse and recurrence in mood disorders and an increased risk of suicide. In addition to changes in sleep architecture, patients with major depression show profoundly altered patterns of nocturnal hormone secretion, possibly through mechanisms that link regulation of sleep with neuroendocrine activity. Basic and clinical approaches of sleep research established neurobiological models into the underlying pathophysiology associated with psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Background and purpose: Sleep disorders are increasingly implicated as risk factors for stroke, as well as a determinant of stroke outcome. They can also occur secondary to the stroke itself. In this review, we describe the variety of different sleep disorders associated with stroke and analyze their effect on stroke risk and outcome. Methods: A search term-based literature review (“sleep,” “insomnia,” “narcolepsy,” “restless legs syndrome,” “periodic limb movements during sleep,” “excessive daytime sleepiness” AND “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” in PubMed; “stroke” and “sleep” in ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed. English articles from 1990 to March 2023 were considered. Results: Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke. In addition, sleep disturbance has been reported in half of all stroke sufferers; specifically, an increase is not only sleep-related breathing disorders but also periodic limb movements during sleep, narcolepsy, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, sleep duration, and circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Poststroke sleep disturbance has been associated with worse outcome. Conclusion: Sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke and associated with worse stroke outcome. They are also a common consequence of stroke. Recent guidelines suggest screening for sleep disorders after stroke. It is possible that treatment of sleep disorders could both reduce stroke risk and improve stroke outcome, although further data from clinical trials are required.",

Sodium oxybate was administered and titrated twice nightly, which helped further decrease her cataplexy to once or twice daily. Cataplexy may take the form of prolonged waxing and waning, with partial or complete muscle atonia, called status cataplecticus. Schizophreniamay be co-morbid or an intrinsicmanifestation of narcolepsy. Obesity is frequently observed in association with narcolepsy, contributing to sleepiness.",

If a drug treatment is considered appropriate, however, it is important to recognise the precise nature of a patient's insomnia with respect to sleep onset or sleep maintenance as this will influence the choice of drug. Most non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are considered as 'disorders of arousal' in which a behavioural event occurs when a subject arouses abnormally and partially from the first cycle of deep slow wave sleep. Administration of exogenous melatonin has been investigated for insomnia because it assists sleep in circadian rhythm disorders when phase is altered such as during jet lag. Gabapentin and pregabalin are more commonly used as neuropathic pain agents but have the relatively rare pharmacological property of enhancing slow wave non-REM sleep.",

Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

      "abstract": "Although humans spend as much as a third of their life sleeping, many schools of medicine around the world do not provide sufficient knowledge about the physiology and pathology of sleep to their students, as if diseases fall asleep at night. People suffering from impaired sleep are often unaware of the problem. Along with poor knowledge of sleep pathologies on the part of medical staff, this leads to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of sleep disorders. One of the symptoms indicating sleep abnormality is complaint of fatigue, which can represent: physical weakness, mental fatigue, or sleepiness. The latter type is associated with several sleep disorders, among which are: obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement in sleep, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. To provide accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, medical education programs should offer the students a deeper knowledge of sleep medicine.",

The condition gradually fades away within a few hours or during a night's sleep, and what remains is lack or loss of memory for the episodic period or sometimes retrograde amnesia. Relapses were not observed in the majority of patients. The disease usually develops in people in their sixth to eighth decades of life. The cause of the disease is not yet fully understood.

Sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations were most frequent in narcolepsy-cataplexy, but their frequency did not differ between narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Mean durations of nocturnal sleep, daytime naps, and morning grogginess were not increased in idiopathic hypersomnia compared with other groups. Among subjects without cataplexy, symptoms of sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations were equally common in subjects with and without frequent sleep-onset REM periods. These findings suggest that the occurrence of these symptoms in subjects without classical narcolepsy-cataplexy is a function of factors other than a propensity for early onset of REM sleep and indicate a need to reevaluate diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.",

      "title": "1195 Sleep-related Hallucinations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related hallucinations, encompassing visual and auditory experiences pose a complex clinical challenge. Here, we illustrate 2 cases with diverse underlying etiologies. Report of case(s) Case 1: 76-year-old male with 3 months of nocturnal visual hallucinations, occurring 3-5 nights per week. These ranged from familiar and unfamiliar faces and characters reminiscent of movies. Symptoms occurred when waking up in the middle of the night, with difficulty returning to sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) unveiled moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without findings indicative of parasomnias and no symptoms on the night of PSG. Brain MRI revealed chronic infarcts involving right basal ganglia and bilateral optic radiations. Lesions of structures that commonly cause visual hallucinations (optic lens, retina, thalamus, midbrain) were absent. The frequency of episodes decreased to 1-2 per month after initiating CPAP therapy. Potential mechanism of improvement could be PAP mediated optimization of perfusion to the ischemic penumbra. Case 2: 93-year-old male with an eight-year history of insomnia due to musical hallucinations (MH). Auditory experiences included church and semi-classical music, with 80% being familiar tunes. The patient, a former church choir member, has a history of progressive hearing loss and tinnitus. Brain MRI/MRA revealed chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes. Extended EEG showed no evidence of seizures. Audiometry confirmed moderate-severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. No response was seen to Levetiracetam, Gabapentin, Donepezil and behavioral therapy. Home sleep study revealed severe OSA. CPAP therapy did not result in improvement of MH. MH improved significantly with Lorazepam. Hypoacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication are common etiologies for MH. The etiology in this case is very likely due to hypoacusis. The hypothesis is deafferentation resulting in release phenomenon or spontaneous activity in the auditory pathway, manifesting as MH. Conclusion Sleep-related and nocturnal hallucinations warrant a comprehensive evaluation. Differential diagnoses include neurological causes, including stroke, seizure, Multiple Sclerosis, tumor, vascular lesions, and neurodegenerative disorders. Other etiologies include psychiatric disorders, medications, alcohol, otologic and ophthalmic pathologies. It is also reasonable to evaluate for comorbid OSA as appropriate treatment may decrease the frequency of episodes and improve overall sleep in some patients. Support (if any)",

The patient’s sleep history was positive for the full narcoleptic tetrad (sleep attacks, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations) while extensive neuropsychiatric work up was negative for any neurologic or psychiatric illness. Repeat polysomnograms (including a polysomnogram with a full seizure montage) were positive for pathologic sleepiness, but there was no evidence of a seizure disorder. The course of the patient’s symptomatology and the favourable response of his symptoms to stimulants and imipramine support the theory that his intermittent loss of sphincter control is part of his narcolepsy-cataplexy.",

No references for antiepileptic drugs and especially for lamotrigine are known regarding pharmacologically induced RBD. Case Report: We report a case of a 68-year-old man already suffering from RBD, who developed very brief episodes of epigastric discomfort followed by impaired consciousness and was given a diagnosis of epilepsy. Lamotrigine was started at 25 mg/d, reached a maximum of 100 mg/d after 2 months and was retained at this dose for 1 more month. During this period there was a slight decrease in the episodes of impaired consciousness and no appreciable changes in the frequency and intensity of RBD symptomatology. Immediately following the abrupt discontinuation of lamotrigine, RBD symptomatology was severely aggravated, with dreams becoming more vivid and frightening and occurring almost every night. RBD symptomatology gradually subsided over 2 months, reaching levels comparable to those before lamotrigine. The impaired consciousness episodes remained unaffected and were considered to be nonepileptic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine may worsen symptoms of comorbid idiopathic RBD.",

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

When this situation causes a significant impairment, it's called circadian rhythm sleep The underlying pathophysiology involves either a dysfunction of the endogenous clock (located in the Suprachiasmathic nucleus of the hypothalamus) or a failure of the mechanisms of environmental synchronization (involving the retina and retino-hypothalamic tract). The principal clinical syndromes are: delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS), irregular sleep-wake rhythm, free-running disorder, jet lag disorder and shift work disorder. The treatment requires resynchronization of the endogenous clock with environmental clues. Some useful alternatives include timed exposure to bright light, melatonin and physical activity, associated to correct sleep hygiene. In some cases, the intermittent use of stimulants (caffeine, modafinil) and hypnotics may be useful for symptom relief, but only for short periods.",

      "abstract": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.",

RBD typically manifests as complex dream-enacting behaviors that are often vivid, unpleasant, or violent. The episodes typically occur approximately 90 minutes after sleep onset, coinciding with the timing of the first REM cycle, and may recur with subsequent REM sleep cycles. The diagnosis of RBD is based on a clinical history of injurious or potentially injurious dream-enacting behavior that disrupts REM sleep. Diagnosis requires a polysomnography (PSG). PSG shows REM sleep without atonia, excessive tonic and phasic electromyogram (EMG) activity recorded from the chin, excessive phasic EMG activity in the limbs, and abnormal REM sleep behaviors. Differential diagnoses encompass other causes of abnormal behavior in sleep, such as NREM parasomnias, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which may mimic RBD. Clonazepam is very effective in treating RBD and is considered first-line treatment.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life-threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured-individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

      "abstract": "Seizure is the most common neurologic disorder in the pediatric age. Obtaining thorough\nhistory and performing complete examination as well as electroencephalography (EEG) are very\nimportant in confirming the diagnosis and finding the cause. Epileptiform activity may be enhanced by activating procedures including sleep deprivation. In this study we performed short duration (up to 8 hours) sleep deprivation in 139 children with history of seizure but with normal or non specific awake EEG. We obtained 70% abnormality, 54% of which was of classic pattern of absence (3 Hz spike and slow wave). Most abnormal EEGs belonged to children in the age range of 5-10 yrs. It seems that short duration sleep deprivation is as useful as long duration sleep deprivation.",

      "abstract": "The sense of personal identity is an element of the Jasperian definition of self-conscience. Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

Se debe a la disfunción directa o indirecta de las estructuras del tronco cerebral que regulan el sueño REM, especialmente el núcleo subceruleus. El TCSR puede ser idiopático o asociado a enfermedades neurológicas como la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP), la demencia con cuerpos de Lewy (DCL), la atrofia multisistémica (AMS) y la narcolepsia. Los pacientes con la forma idiopática, especialmente los que tienen alterados el SPECT del transportador de la dopamina, la sonografía de la sustancia negra, los test de olfato y de la visión de colores, tienen un elevado riesgo de desarrollar la E P, DCL y AMS. El TCSR no debe considerarse como un simple trastorno del sueño, sino como una manifestación de una enfermedad neurológica. El clonazepam (0.25-4 mg) y la melatonina (3-12 mg) a la hora de acostarse mejoran los síntomas del TCSR pero no evitan, en la forma idiopática, la conversión a una enfermedad neurodegenerativa. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dreamenacting behaviors, nightmares and lack of atonia during REM sleep. It is caused by indirect or direct impairment of those structures that regulate REM sleep atonia, particularly the locus subceruleus. RBD may be idiopathic or linked to Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and narcolepsy. Idiopathic RBD patients, especially those with abnormal dopamine transporter uptake imaging, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, hyposmia and color vision damage are those with high risk to develop PD, DLB and MSA. RBD may not be considered as a parasomnia but rather as an integral part of a neurodegenerative disease. Clonazepam (0.5-4 mg) and melatonin (3-12 mg) at bed time improve the symptoms of RBD but does not prevent the conversion to a neurodegenerative disease.",

MDD is one of the most common medical disorders, with a lifetime US prevalence of at least 17% and a 1-year prevalence of at least 7% [2]. Depression is the leading cause of years lost due to disability worldwide and the third overall contributor to worldwide burden of disease; however, depression is currently the primary contributor to burden of disease in high- and middle-income countries [3]. MDD is associated with an increased risk for suicide, but may also increase all-cause mortality [4].",

After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes.

No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

      "title": "1204 Importance of Arm Electromyography for REM Without Atonia Detection",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Dream enactment raises concern for rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RBD is a parasomnia during which the patient has loss of normal atonia during REM sleep. RBD is highly associated with α-synucleinopathies (i.e., Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy) and can precede additional neurodegenerative signs and symptoms. REM sleep without atonia (RWA) is demonstrated through electromyography (EMG) during polysomnography. RWA requires the presence of tonic/sustained activity with ≥50% of the epoch containing excessive chin activity or phasic/transient muscle activity in ≥5 mini-epochs of 3-second duration in a 30-second epoch. We present a case that highlights the necessity of ordering polysomnography with arm EMG when evaluating for RBD. Report of case(s) A 73-year-old man presented to the clinic for concern of obstructive sleep apnea. He was also evaluated by neurology and given a diagnosis of essential tremor. During the initial visit, he also reported frequent “night terrors,” which he later described as dream enactment. His medications included metoprolol but no antidepressants; however, the dream enactment started prior to beta-blocker use. His physical exam was notable for right cogwheel rigidity, mild decrease in right serial finger tapping and rapid alternating movements, and mild dysphonia. A polysomnogram with arm EMG was ordered. On polysomnography, RWA was present in multiple epochs that was seen predominantly with arm (flexor digitorum superficialis) EMG. The RWA index (% of REM sleep meeting criteria for RWA) using the leg (anterior tibialis) and chin EMG was only 5%; however, the RWA index with the addition of arm EMG increased the RWA index to 64%. Conclusion The presence of RWA on PSG with dream enactment behavior gives this patient the diagnosis of RBD. While leg EMG is a part of routine PSG, arm EMG is not and needs to be specifically requested. Although research supports the use of arm EMG leads, we commonly find the addition of arm EMG leads is not ordered by providers when assessing for RBD. Arm EMG increases the chance of observing RWA and can be of strong importance to solidify an RBD diagnosis. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: Cefaleia representa um problema de saúde pública, podendo ser primárias, quando são por si só a patologia ou secundárias quando são apenas um sintoma de uma outra patologia de base. Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "title": "Narcolepsies and Other Central Hypersomnolence Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Central hypersomnolence disorders correspond to numerous etiologies of patients with a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, excessive quantity of sleep (i.e., hypersomnia), or sleep inertia (i.e., alteration in vigilance following waking up). Hypersomnolence significantly interferes with several aspects of life, including negative social and professional impacts. Several steps of evaluation of these patients are required to explore sleep, sleepiness, and hypersomnia; to quantify the severity of the condition; and to achieve a diagnosis of central hypersomnolence disorder. Hence, clinical interviews, questionnaires, sleep diaries, polysomnography, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, continuous 24-hour polysomnography recording, and additional tests in particular circumstances (measurement of hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid, HLA DQB1*06:02 genotyping, and brain magnetic resonance imaging) allow the definitive diagnosis of central hypersomnolence disorders. This chapter details the clinical signs, laboratory investigations, pathophysiology, management, and some perspectives on most etiologies of central hypersomnolence disorder as reported in the revised International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition: narcolepsy Type I and Type II; idiopathic hypersomnia; Kleine-Levin syndrome; insufficient sleep syndrome; and hypersomnia due to a medical disorder, due to a medication or substance, or associated with a psychiatric disorder.",

      "abstract": "Die Epilepsie und epileptische Anfälle haben einen signifikanten und nachhaltigen Effekt auf den Schlaf von Epilepsiepatienten. Nächtliche generalisierte tonisch-klonische Anfälle, aber auch multiple fokal-komplexe Anfälle führen zu einer Störung der Schlafarchitektur sowie zu einer vermehrten Tagesmüdigkeit. Zudem ist kein REM-Rebound in den nachfolgenden Nächten zu beobachten. Unabhängig von den Anfällen führt der chronische epileptische Zustand – insbesondere bei Patienten mit fokalen Epilepsien – zu Störungen der Schlafarchitektur. Epilepsiepatienten leiden im Vergleich zur Allgemeinbevölkerung an einer 2- bis 3-fach erhöhten Prävalenz von subjektiv empfundenen Schlafstörungen. Schlafstörungen sind zudem mit einer signifikanten Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität assoziiert. Auch Kinder mit Epilepsie leiden häufiger an Schlafstörungen als gesunde Kinder, wobei eine schlechte Schlafqualität wiederum zu Verhaltensproblemen und einer schlechteren Lebensqualität führt. Eine vermehrte Tagesmüdigkeit stellt mit einer Prävalenz von 30–50% die häufigste schlafbezogene Störung bei Epilepsiepatienten dar und konnte auch mit objektiven Tests nachgewiesen werden. Obstruktive Schlaf-Apnoen (OSA) treten bei Epilepsiepatienten mit einer Prävalenz von 10–33% signifikant häufiger auf als in der Allgemeinbevölkerung. Als mögliche Mechanismen sind die Effekte von zentral dämpfenden Antiepileptika, eine durch Antiepileptika verursachte Gewichtszunahme und das gehäufte Vorliegen eines polyzystischen Ovar-Syndroms bei Frauen mit Epilepsie anzuführen. Eine OSA kann mit einer Exazerbation von Anfällen einhergehen. Umgekehrt kann die erfolgreiche Behandlung einer OSA zu einer Verbesserung der Anfallskontrolle führen.",

      "title": "Practical Approach for the Diagnosis and Management of Insomnia During Menopausal Transition",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

Przez długie miesiące był leczony w oddziale intensywnej terapii i rehabilitacyjnym. Zaprzeczał tendencjom samobójczym, nie był w stanie wyjaśnić przyczyny tego skoku. Z powodu objawów depresyjnych był leczony przeciwdepresyjnie, rozpoznano epizod depresji umiarkowany. Następnie wystąpiły u niego objawy psychotyczne, z powodu których był hospitalizowany w oddziałach psychiatrycznych, gdzie podejrzewano schizofrenię. Był leczony przeciwpsychotycznie. Wypisany został z rozpoznaniem ostrych wielopostaciowych zaburzeń z objawami schizofrenii.

Eugeniusza Brzezickiego w latach pięćdziesiątych ubiegłego wieku. Jednocześnie przypadek ten przypomina o tym, że zupełnie bezzasadne, niewytłumaczone żadnymi okolicznościami nagłe zdarzenie związane z uczynieniem sobie bardzo poważnych szkód zdrowotnych może być sygnałem rozpoczynających się zaburzeń psychotycznych, ale niekoniecznie prowadzi do stwierdzenia schizofrenii, jak to sugerował autor pojęcia „paragnomen”.",

      "title": "Tolerability, pharmacokinetics and night‐time effects on postural sway and critical flicker fusion of gaboxadol and zolpidem in elderly subjects",
      "abstract": "WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT • Body sway increases in older adults and may lead to an increase in the risk of falling. • The problem of impaired stability in the elderly may be compounded by the use of hypnotics, which have been associated with an increased risk of next‐day falls as well as drowsiness. • The potential adverse effects of hypnotic drugs on steadiness may be exacerbated during the night, in the event that an individual needs to get out of bed. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS • This study examines the effects of gaboxadol (an investigational treatment for insomnia), zolpidem (a current hypnotic included as an active control) and placebo on body sway and attention/information processing ability following bedtime dosing in elderly subjects who were woken during the night for assessments. • Zolpidem and gaboxadol increased body sway at various time points during the night relative to placebo; at 1.5 h post dose, the time of peak concentrations of both drugs, gaboxadol produced less impairment than zolpidem. • Compared with placebo, neither gaboxadol nor zolpidem impaired attention/information‐processing ability as assessed by critical flicker fusion. AIMS To evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and night‐time effects on body sway and critical flicker fusion (CFF) of gaboxadol following bedtime dosing in healthy elderly subjects. METHODS Subjects (17 women, seven men) aged 65–75 years received gaboxadol 10 mg, zolpidem 5 mg (active control) or placebo at 22.00 h in a three‐period, randomized, double‐blind crossover study. They were awakened during the night for evaluation of body sway and CFF. Pharmacokinetics of gaboxadol were assessed during a fourth single‐blind treatment period. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS The number of subjects with adverse events was 14 for gaboxadol 10 mg, seven for zolpidem and nine for placebo; most were mild or moderate in intensity. Two women discontinued the study following gaboxadol; one vomited and one experienced a severe vasovagal syncope after venepuncture. Mean gaboxadol t max was 2 h, t ½ was 1.7 h, AUC 0–∞ was 430 ng·h ml −1 and C max was 139 ng ml −1 . At 1.5 h and 4 h post dose, zolpidem increased body sway relative to placebo ( P &lt; 0.01). Gaboxadol increased body sway at 4 h ( P &lt; 0.001) and 8 h ( P &lt; 0.05) relative to placebo. At 1.5 h, the time point closest to peak drug concentrations, zolpidem increased body sway compared with gaboxadol ( P &lt; 0.01). Gaboxadol and zolpidem had no effects on CFF vs. placebo. CONCLUSIONS A bedtime dose of gaboxadol 10 mg was generally well tolerated. Changes in body sway at 1.5 h after bedtime dosing were smaller with gaboxadol 10 mg than with zolpidem 5 mg, whereas changes were similar at 4 h for both treatments and returned to near baseline at 8 h.",

      "title": "PHOX2B mutations in three Chinese patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome",
      "abstract": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS, OMIM #209880) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) characterized by an abnormal autonomic ventilatory response to progressive hypercarbia and sustained hypoxemia. Patients typically present in the newborn period with hypoventilation or apnea asleep, awake, or both, without any associated cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular or brainstem lesions. Rarely, some patients may present at a later age and are diagnosed to have late onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LOCHS).1 Other features of ANS dysfunction such as feeding difficulty due to oesophageal dysmotility, severe constipation in the absence of Hirschsprung disease, poor regulation of basal body temperature, episodes of profuse sweating, pupillary and ocular abnormalities, decreased beat-to-beat variability of heart rate, attenuated response of heart rate to exercise, abnormal fluctuation of blood pressure, decreased perception to pain, and decreased perception to anxiety may be variably present but not essential for diagnosis.1 Furthermore, this central hypoventilation can occur as an isolated feature or in association with a number of neurocristopathies, notably Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome, OMIM #209880) and tumours of the sympathetic nervous system particularly neuroblastoma, ganglioneuro- blastoma, and ganglioneuroma, which were found in 20% and 5%—10% of CCHS patients, respectively.2 Studies of genes pertinent to the early embryologic development of the neural crest cells, specifically the endothelin and the RET-GDNF signaling pathways, have recently led to the identification of PHOX2B as the major disease causing gene for CCHS.2-6PHOX2B was mapped to chromosome 4p12 and consists of 3 exons. It encodes a highly conserved paired-like homeobox transcription factor of 314 amino acids linked to the RET-GDNF signaling pathway. The DNA binding homeodomain is encoded by exon 2, whereas exon 3 encodes two short and stable polyalanine tracts of 9 and 20 residues, respectively. Expression studies performed in mice and human have shown that this is a master regulatory gene crucial for the proper development of the peripheral and central ANS.3,7,8 In this work, we detected PHOX2B mutations in three local Chinese patients diagnosed with CCHS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CCHS in Chinese. METHODS Patients Three male patients with CCHS were ascertained because of persistent hypoventilation in the absence of primary pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, brainstem and metabolic causes. Their clinical features were summarized in Table.Table: Clinical features of the three patients with CCHSMutational screening of thePHOX2Bgene Peripheral blood samples were taken after the families had consented for PHOX2B testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The three exons and their intron-exon boundaries of the PHOX2B gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Ava II enzyme digestion and direct sequencing as described by Matera et al.6 The reference sequence is the human PHOX2B mRNA sequence (GeneBank accession number NM_003924). RESULTS Patient 1 A heterozygous c.586_c.590insG mutation was detected in exon 3 (Fig. 1). This is a frameshift mutation predicted to result in termination of translation at codon 359 (359X). Such mutation was not detected in his parents.Fig. 1.: Sequence chromatogram from exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. A heterozygous c.586_c.590insG was detected in Patient 1.Patient 2 A heterozygous in-frame duplication of 18 nucleotides was detected in exon 3, leading to an insertion of 6 alanines to the 20-alanines tract (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Parents’ PHOX2B genes were analyzed and found to be normal.Fig. 2.: Ava II enzymatic digestion of the PCR products of the exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. Extra band with size larger than 270 bp was observed in Patients 2 and 3, indicating expansion of the polyalanine tract. Lanes M1 and M2 are DNA size markers; Lanes N1 and N2 are normal controls; B is blank.Fig. 3.: Sequence chromatogram from exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. A heterozygous c.758_c.759ins18 was detected in Patient 2 and a heterozygous c.776_c.777ins21 was detected in Patient 3. The former insertion was occurred within the 13th alanine codon of the polyalanine tract, while the latter was occurred within the 19th alanine codon. A heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change was also detected in patient 3, which is a silent mutation.Patient 3 A heterozygous in-frame duplication of 21 nucleotides was detected in exon 3, leading to an insertion of 7 alanines to the 20-alanines tract (Figs. 2, 3). A heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change was also detected in patient 3, which is a silent mutation. Analyses of the parents’ PHOX2B genes were normal except that the father also had the heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change. As the c.762A>C nucleotide change was not a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we analyzed the DNA samples from 40 normal controls. We found that 5/40 (allele frequency 6.25%) controls also had a heterozygous c.762A>C change, indicating that it is a common SNP. DISCUSSION Several studies have shown that heterozygous mutation in PHOX2B is sufficient to cause CCHS and confirmed its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern,2-6,9-11 with incomplete penetrance.6 Taken together, there are 314 CCHS patients studied worldwide, with 14 cases being LOCHS. PHOX2B mutations were identified in 293 patients (93%). A mutational hotspot exists in the 20-alanines tract encoded by exon 3 as 91% of the mutations identified consisted of polyalanine expansion within this tract with size ranging from +5 to +13 (266/293). Small alanine repeats contraction has been identified in a few normal individuals, with size varied from -1 to -7.2-6 Rare frameshift and missense mutations account for the rest (27/293). Interestingly, most of these mutations did not disrupt the homeodomain. The molecular pathogenesis was thought to be protein misfolding that in turn led to decreased DNA binding, cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregation and nuclear exclusion, and or a partial dominant negative effect.12,13 Haploinsufficiency alone appeared insufficient to cause the full spectrum of CCHS, because a patient reported by Benailly with deletion of the PHOX2B gene had neither hypoventilation nor ANS dysfunction, but only Hirschsprung disease.8 Attempts of genotype-phenotype correlation have shown that the size of the polyalanine repeat expansion correlates with the severity of the respiratory phenotype and ANS symptoms.5,6 Such observation has been supported by two independent functional studies of the PHOX2B mutations, both of which found a progressive decrease in the transactivation of PHOX2B mediated target genes with lengthening of the expanded alanine tract.12,13 While frameshift and missense mutations appeared to result in CCHS phenotype at the severe end of the spectrum.6,11 with a predisposition to tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. 2 Bachetti et al12 proposed that the observed oncogenic role for frameshift mutations in the PHOX2B gene, among others, could be related to its ability to enhance the activity of the PHOX2A promoter, a transcription factor that acts with PHOX2B in the RET-GDNF signaling pathway. Here we report three Chinese patients with CCHS, our results generally support the overseas’ findings. All three cases presented in the newborn period with apnea and respiratory insufficiency that required ventilatory support. Patient 1, with a frameshift mutation (c.586_c.590insG), had the most severe phenotype. He was born preterm at 34 weeks with polyhydramnios, IUGR and poor respiratory effort requiring ventilatory support starting from birth. The apnea phenotype could overlap with apnea of prematurity and required a high index of suspicion. He developed constipation and abdominal distension on day 2 of life. Biopsy confirmed Hirschsprung disease with total colonic aganglionosis extending to distal small bowel. Patient 2, with an expansion of 6 alanines in the 20-alanines tract, had isolated central hypoventilation without the Hirschsprung association. Patient 3, with an expansion of 7 alanines, had both central hypoventilation and Hirschsprung disease, presenting with abdominal distension on day 2 and failure to pass meconium since birth. The extent of aganglionosis was uncertain, however, as his clinical course was complicated by necrotizing enterocolitis with transmural necrosis from part of ileum to whole colon, bowel resection and short gut syndrome. All three of them needed ventilatory support both awake and asleep. It is noteworthy that, with growth and maturation, they all subsequently became ventilator dependent only during asleep. Ocular abnormalities are common in CCHS patients as exemplified by patients 2 and 3, both of whom have strabismus. The smallest polyalanine expansion size known to date that led to the CCHS/HSCR is 6. However, not all CCHS patients harboring +6 to +13 polyalanine expansion developed Hirschsprung disease as shown by patient 2, suggesting that other modifying genes likely exist to modulate the penetrance for Hirschsprung disease. None of the three patients described here has shown any evidence of tumors of neural crest derivatives yet. However, predicted from his genotype, patient 1 will be at higher risk of developing tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. The great majority of the mutations were de novo, and the common polyalanine tract expansion was postulated to be the result of unequal crossover between the homologues during meiosis.3-6 Nevertheless, somatic mosaicism has been proposed in 4.5%2 and 10%5 of parents. Possibility of germline mosaicism cannot be excluded either. Finally, of the 14 cases with LOCHS studied, 9 (64%) were found to have mutations in the PHOX2B gene with an expansion of 5 alanines in the polyalanine tract,2,6,14,15 suggesting that idiopathic LOCHS and CCHS are indeed allelic disorders.",

      "title": "An Elderly Man With Chaotic Sleep Behaviors and Rapidly Progressive Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are increasingly recognized as common features of autoimmune encephalitis (AE), manifesting in various presentations, including insomnia, hypersomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias, and sleep breathing disorders. These features may be overlooked because of the difficulty of detecting them and a lack of awareness of their significance. Here, we provide an interesting case, with video-polysomnography (v-PSG) documentation, of an unusual sleep manifestation associated with rapidly progressive ataxia of an elderly man with AE. An 87-year-old man, who was a retired soldier with previously able activity of daily living is activity of daily living, presented with progressive hypersomnolence and abnormal behaviors during sleep over the last 3 months. His wife observed that he occasionally had abnormal motor behaviors during sleep, resembling fighting in the air during the night. In the last 2 months, he also had visual hallucinations and his cognition had declined. One week before admission, he developed an unsteady gait with repeated falls and the abnormal motor behaviors during sleep occurred more frequently. His past medical history included well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications were linagliptin (5 mg/day) and repaglinide (150 mg/day). He had no history of illicit drug or alcohol use. On admission, general examinations were unremarkable. However, although he was alert and co-operative, he intermittently lapsed into sleep, but was easily roused. During those sleep episodes, he developed abnormal behaviors resembling daytime work tasks and vocalizations (mumbling sound), which immediately presented from the onset of sleep (Video 1). These abnormal sleep episodes occurred most of the day and night time. Eye movement examination revealed broken pursuit and hypermetric saccades, whereas other cerebellar signs were impaired, consisting of truncal ataxia, wide-based gait, impaired tandem gait, and impaired bilateral finger-to-nose test (Video 2). Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 14/30 with the prominent impairment of attention and recall memory. Other examinations were normal. After a few days after admission, his symptoms rapidly progressed. His consciousness declined to stupor with frequent inspiratory stridor, requiring intubation and ventilator support. We did not observe any episode of faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) during admission. This video was performed on the second night of admission. He developed abnormal behaviors resembling doing daytime work tasks and vocalization (mumbling sound), which immediately presented from sleep onset. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13537 Eye movement examination revealed broken pursuit and hypermetric saccades, whereas other cerebellar signs were impaired, consisting of truncal ataxia, wide-based gait, impaired tandem gait, and impaired bilateral finger-to-nose test. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13537 Blood chemistry revealed marked hypokalemia (2.2 mmol/L) without hyponatraemia (Na 138 mmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles revealed white blood cell (WBC) 3 cell/mm3, no red blood cell (RBC), protein 27 mg/dL, glucose 75 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan showed no abnormal hypersignal intensity or contrast enhancement, whereas electroencephalography demonstrated diffuse background slowing without epileptiform discharge. Interestingly, the 24 hours wearable v-PSG test exhibited at almost every time period a mixture of α rhythm, REM, and slow-wave sleep, which was compatible with status dissociatus (SD) (Fig. 1). The serum autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibodies were positive for leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody, whereas the rest (NMDAR, CASPR2, GABAb, DPPX6, AMPA, Ma2, IgLON5) were all negative, but anti-LGI1 and other antibodies were negative in CSF studies. Comprehensive radiological investigations, consisting of computed tomography (CT) chest and whole abdomen did not identify any underlying malignancy. A complete course of intravenous immunoglobulin and pulse methylprednisolone was given, followed by oral prednisolone, which gradually improved cognition and reduced abnormal sleep episodes. He could walk without support 3 months later and abnormal sleep episodes were gone. The presentations of our patient, consisting of rapidly progressive cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and subacute sleep–wake disorders including progressive hypersomnolence and abnormal behaviors during sleep, raised the possibility of an autoimmune process, prion disease, or an atypical presentation of a neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. The presence of SD was a unique characteristic in this case. SD is an extreme form of parasomnia with overlapping features of non-REM, REM sleep, and wakefulness and is presented in fatal familial insomnia1 or severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome.2 In addition, the combination of sleep disturbances, inspiratory stridor, and gait instability could lead to the possibility of encephalopathy associated with IgLON5 antibodies.3 However, our case had other atypical presentations, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, lack of FBDS, and lack of hyponatraemia. The typical presentation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis, which is frequently manifested in elderly men,4-6 is characterized by a triad of memory changes, seizures, and abnormal movements. FBDS has been reported in 26% to 71% of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis.4 Finally, although sleep disorders in AE are less recognized in clinical practice, these features have been reported in 20% to 65% of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis, encompassing insomnia, hypersomnia, RBD, periodic limb movements in sleep, and obstructive sleep apnea.7-9 In addition, we reviewed relevant literature on sleep disorders and AE, as shown in Table 1. Considering cerebellar ataxia in anti-LGI1 encephalitis, only two case reports were identified of a child and a young adult with LGI1 antibody-associated AE presented with progressive and episodic ataxia.10, 11 In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the importance of sleep disorders in AE. Sleep disorders can be the first clinical presentation in AE, a treatable disorder, and v-PSG can assist in differentiating sleep disturbances to aid diagnosis. Early awareness and prompt effective management of uncommon sleep manifestations are vital and potentially associated with improved treatment outcomes (Video 3).

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

      "title": "Sleep, Depression and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle?",
      "abstract": "Sleep, depression and insomnia have manifold associations. Psychiatric sleep research in affective disorders has demonstrated that sleep in depression is characterized by an impairment of sleep continuity, deficits in slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep (including shortened REM latency and increased REM density). Traditionally, insomnia, i.e. prolonged latency to fall asleep and increased frequency of nocturnal wake periods, was considered as an unspecific symptom of affective disorders. In the meantime, a shift in clinical and scientific focus has taken place viewing insomnia in addition as an independent diagnostic entity and as a clinical predictor of depression. Unfortunately, the neurobiological processes underlying the relationships between sleep, insomnia and depression have not been fully identified yet. It is clear that both insomnia and depression are characterized by alterations in the arousal system in the CNS presenting as hyperarousal. Moreover, insomniac patients display reduced and fragmented REM sleep periods, which might interfere negatively with basal processes of emotion regulation. The alterations in the arousal system and the interaction of it with the affect-regulatory system over the course of time might influence cognitive systems and hence lead to the clinical picture of depression. Given the suggestion of insomnia symptoms as possibly involved in the causation and the maintenance of psychopathology in general, this type of sequence might also be found in relation to other mental disorders.

The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

The initiation of breathing after apnea was often accompanied with generalized muscles contraction like a startle response. In the waking state the apnea induced generalized muscular hypotonicity and the decline of wakefulness. Arterial CO2 and O2 saturation was within normal limits.

Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

      "title": "ENURESIS IN CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "Recent demographic studies report a prevalence of nocturnal enuresis in at least 5 - 10% of six to seven year old children, most often boys, and in 0.5% of the adult population. Bedwetting is the most common chronic problem in childhood next to allergic disorders. Nocturnal enuresis is still perceived as a shameful condition and kept as a secret. But there is nothing shameful about bedwetting. It is caused by a delay in maturation of the somatic mechanisms responsible for sleeping dry all night. This delay is most often hereditary in nature. With few exceptions, nocturnal enuresis is not caused by psychosocial factors; but it generates psychological problems for the child, especially evident as a deterioration of self-esteem. Nocturnal enuresis results from nocturnal polyuria and/or reduced bladder capacity and, in addition, the child’s inability to wake up as a response to an over-full bladder. With this background, the treatment for nocturnal enuresis is based on enuresis alarm, which is meant to induce arousal, and/or desmopressin (Minirin®, DDAVP) which reduces the amount of urine produced. The alarm may be the first choice but needs a strong support from both the prescribing physician and the parents. Desmopressin is used when the alarm fails or is not accepted by the family and it is increasingly becoming the first choice. Desmopressin in long-term treatment may, like the alarm, give lasting cure of nocturnal enuresis, in particular if medication is preceded with some weeks with bladder training (urotherapy). Thus, the advice to the medical profession is to identify nocturnal enuresis and prescribe treatment when the patient wants to sleep dry.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Sleep is a vital neurochemical process involving sleep-promoting and arousal centers in the brain. Insomnia is a pervasive disorder characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining or non-refreshing (poor quality) sleep and clinically significant daytime distress. Insomnia is more prevalent in women and old age and puts sufferers at significant physical and mental health risks. This review summarizes published data on the current and emerging insomnia drug classes, rationale for development and associated risks/benefits. (Summary of Product Characteristics and Medline search on \"hypnotic\" or specific drug names and \"Insomnia\"). Areas covered: GABAA receptor modulators facilitate sleep onset and some improve maintenance but increase risk of dependence, memory, cognitive and psychomotor impairments, falls, accidents and mortality. Melatonin receptor agonists improve quality of sleep and/or sleep onset but response may develop over several days. They have more benign safety profiles and are indicated for milder insomnia, longer usage and (prolonged release melatonin) older patients. Histamine H-1 receptor antagonists improve sleep maintenance but their effects on cognition, memory and falls remain to be demonstrated. Late-stage pipeline orexin OX1/OX2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptor antagonists may hold the potential to address several unmet needs in insomnia pharmacotherapy but safety issues cast some doubts over their future. Expert opinion: Current and new insomnia drugs in the pipeline target different sleep regulating mechanisms and symptoms and have different tolerability profiles. Drug selection would ideally be based on improvement in the quality of patients' sleep, overall quality of life and functional status weighed against risk to the individual and public health.",

Although sub-clinical sleep disturbances (insufficient sleep duration or inadequate sleep quality) may be difficult to assess with conceptual and/or methodological clarity, this review attempts to summarize and synthesize these findings. First, the concept of sleep disturbance in a public health context is introduced, to provide context and rationale. Second, operational definitions of 'cardiometabolic disease' and 'sleep disturbance' are offered, to address many unclear operationalizations. Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions. Finally, a research agenda of future directions is proposed.",

Indeed, in many respiratory clinics OSAHS is now the most common diagnosis. Neurologists need to be familiar with the OSAHS because it may present rather like some primarily neurological conditions, and because patients with neurological and neuromuscular disorders can develop the OSAHS. Indeed, in the February 2002 issue of <i>Practical Neurology</i>, Sam Berkovic and Philip King urged neurologists to wake up to sleep medicine (Berkovic &amp; King 2002). The best definition of the OSAHS is at least five, some would say 15, breathing pauses (apnoeas) or hypopnoeas (near apnoeas), each lasting 10 s or more, per hour of sleep in association with sleepiness or at least two other major symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, unrefreshing nocturnal sleep or nocturia (Table 1).

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

The epidemiological evidence is reviewed, the diagnostic criteria most frequently used in clinical practice are examined, and a series of therapeutic recommendations for the correct treatment of this pathology is presented. Sleep disorders are very prevalent in the general population (one-third experiences difficulty with sleep initiation/maintenance at least once a week, and about 6-15% meet the criteria for insomnia disorders), but remain relatively poorly understood and frequently overlooked by healthcare professionals. Prevalence estimates of insomnia disorder vary between 5% and 20%. Sleep disorders co-exist with psychiatric and medical conditions with an interactive and bidirectional relationship. About 70-80% of psychiatric patients show some sleep disturbance and there is a correlation between the severity of the sleep disturbance and the severity of the psychopathology. Untreated sleep disorders increase the risk of cardiovascular events, cognitive impairment, motor vehicle accidents, obesity, diabetes, and efficiency and safety at work, leading to increased all-cause healthcare utilization and being a strong predictor of sick leave or disability pension and poor quality of life. Sleep disorders can cause drowsiness or excessive daytime sleepiness, which can lead to functional impairment in 15% of the general adult population. Sleep quality should be a routine target in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric and non-psychiatric diseases to ensure sleep health based on early diagnosis and adequate therapeutic approaches.",

People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

      "title": "Exploration of sleep disorders in the elderly: which particularities?",
      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

      "title": "Resolution of Sleep Paralysis by Weak Electromagnetic Fields in a Patient with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis refers to episodes of inability to move during the onset of sleep or more commonly upon awakening. Patients often describe the sensation of struggling to move and may experience simultaneous frightening vivid hallucinations and dreams. Sleep paralysis and other manifestations of dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep, which reflect deficient monoaminergic regulation of neural modulators of REM sleep, have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A 40 year old woman with remitting-progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) experienced episodes of sleep paralysis since the age of 16, four years prior to the onset of her neurological symptoms. Episodes of sleep paralysis, which manifested at a frequency of about once a week, occurred only upon awakening in the morning and were considered by the patient as a most terrifying experience. Periods of mental stress, sleep deprivation, physical fatigue and exacerbation of MS symptoms appeared to enhance the occurrence of sleep paralysis. In July of 1992 the patient began experimental treatment with AC pulsed applications of picotesla intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 5Hz frequency which were applied extracerebrally 1-2 times per week. During the course of treatment with EMFs the patient made a dramatic recovery of symptoms with improvement in vision, mobility, balance, bladder control, fatigue and short term memory. In addition, her baseline pattern reversal visual evoked potential studies, which showed abnormally prolonged latencies in both eyes, normalized 3 weeks after the initiation of magnetic therapy and remained normal more than 2.5 years later. Since the introduction of magnetic therapy episodes of sleep paralysis gradually diminished and abated completely over the past 3 years. This report suggests that MS may be associated with deficient REM sleep inhibitory neural mechanisms leading to sleep paralysis secondary to the intrusion of REM sleep atonia and dream imagery into the waking state. Pineal melatonin and monoaminergic neurons have been implicated in the induction and maintenance of REM sleep and the pathogenesis of sleep paralysis and it is suggested that resolution of sleep paralysis in this patient by AC pulsed applications of EMFs was related to enhancement of melatonin circadian rhythms and cerebral serotoninergic neurotransmission.",

Sleepiness has an important impact on general health and functional status, influencing how individuals perceive their energy and fatigue levels (3). Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in general have been associated with poor job performance, anxiety, difficulties in personal relations, and an increased risk for fatal and nonfatal automobile accidents, daytime sleepiness resulting from chronic partial or total sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to result in neurocognitive deficits and alterations in mood, and more recently to cause alterations in physiological and endocrine functions (4–26). Sleep deprivation has also been directly or indirectly linked to several recent catastrophes including the Exxon Valdez oil spill, space shuttle Challenger explosion, and the Three Mile Island near-meltdown.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer.

Pada intinya, jet lag merupakan akibat dari ketidaksesuaian yang terjadi setelah melewati daerah dengan waktu yang terlalu cepat. Jet lag memiliki ciri ketidaksesuaian yang sementara antara endogen sirkardian tidur/bangun dan lingkungan fisik eksternal yang mengarah pada perubahan waktu.

It discusses the prevention of sleep loss through the use of sleep-promoting medications. However, much insomnia secondary to medical illness and primary sleep disorders appear to have physiological and behavioral effects similar to those of sleep deprivation. Sleepiness is an inevitable result of sleep deprivation, and when the magnitude of sleepiness is high, the risk of inattention, poor performance, negative mood, and accidents is great. Jet lag was discussed under transient insomnia as sleep disruptive. However, it is the circadian-mediated sleepiness during desired or required waking hours that is often the most problematic component of the jet lag syndrome. Evidence that treatment of transient insomnia reduces or eliminates the sequelae of acute sleep deprivation outside of a laboratory environment is lacking. The frequent predictability of transient insomnia provides opportunity for prevention.",

Many classifications can be used, such as classifications related to the location of the lesion or classifications related to the clinical presentations. The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

      "title": "Paediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem, affecting approximately one-third of the children in the general population. Despite its high prevalence, paediatric insomnia is often unrecognized and untreated in clinical practice. It is commonly associated with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If left untreated, paediatric insomnia may be linked to a constellation of negative impacts in the affected child, including an increased risk of health-related problems (e.g., obesity/overweight, pain, fatigue), psychological issues (e.g., anxiety, depression), interpersonal problems (e.g., poor family relationships, peer problems) and impaired daytime functioning (e.g., poor alertness, impaired school performance), as well as elevated levels of family stress and impaired parental mental health and quality of life. Several factors may contribute to paediatric insomnia, including genetic influence, hyperarousal and hypersensitivity, circadian issues, poor sleep hygiene, comorbid medical conditions, and psychosocial and behavioural factors. A thorough assessment is essential to inform the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. Actigraphy can provide a continuous and objective estimation of sleep-wake patterns, and is a useful tool in the assessment of paediatric insomnia. Behavioural interventions are usually recommended as the first-line treatment and there has been limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of medications for treating paediatric insomnia. The current chapter provides an overview of paediatric insomnia, including the classification and diagnostic criteria, prevalence, consequences, and factors associated with childhood insomnia, as well as its assessment and management.",

      "abstract": "Two cases of non–rapid-eye-movement (NREM) arousal parasomnias in adults are discussed in this chapter. NREM arousal parasomnias occur in 2% of adults and are often triggered by sleep deprivation, emotional stress, circadian rhythm disorders, and sleep fragmentation. Disorders of arousal include confusional arousal, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Research into the pathogenesis of arousal disorders in adults suggests that they reflect aberrant slow-wave sleep regulation, impaired arousal specifically from NREM 3 sleep, and/or sleep/wake state dissociations. Treatment of DoA includes avoidance of sleep deprivation/restriction, irregular sleep/wake schedules, and predisposing/precipitating factors. Pharmacotherapy can be considered when events pose a danger and/or sleep disturbance to the patient and/or others; involve potentially violent, dangerous, or sexual behavior; are frequent, chronic, and refractory to initial therapies; and/or have secondary consequences such as excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life, excessive weight gain, and injuries.",

Majority of these problems are transitory and self-limiting and usually are not recognized by first care physicians and need education.Analysis of sleep structure at the developmental age and of sleep disorders associated with different sleep phases on the basis of video/polysomnography results.Literature review and illustration of fundamental problems associated with sleep physiology and pathology, with special attention to paroxysmal disorders. Additionally 4 cases from our own experience were presented with neurophysiological and clinical aspects.Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases. Our 4 cases document these diagnostic difficulties, requiring video/polysomnography examination 2 of them illustrate frontal lobe epilepsy and single ones myoclonic epilepsy graphy in children is a difficult technique and requires special device, local and trained personnel. It is crucial in gathering objective data about sleep disorders.Correct diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders during sleep in children is possible thanks to video/polysomnography, and enables proper management and pharmacotherpy. It enables improvement or cure disorders during the sleep and moreover enables the obtainment of positive changes in child's every day life.",

      "title": "Sleep-related Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract As in many areas of sleep medicine, it is often a challenge deciding whether or not movements during sleep reflect truly abnormal nocturnal phenomenona or are simply physiological variants. Indeed, when asleep, subconscious shifts of body position occurring every 15 minutes or so are considered entirely normal, as are minor jerks of the extremities and face, particularly during periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, if nocturnal movements are observed to be excessive, violent, or arousing, either to the subject or bed partner, they will usually indicate a defined disorder, especially if the events are stereotypic through the night. Although the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) was revised in 2005 to include a new section dedicated to movement disorders occurring specifically during the state of sleep, diagnostic precision of such phenomena is often lacking and evidenced-based treatment protocols, when indicated, are poorly developed. Furthermore, if a sleep-related movement disorder is recognized, it can be very difficult to determine its true clinical significance for sleep quality and subsequent daytime wakefulness, especially in the elderly patient. This chapter addresses those movement disorders that are intimately or exclusively related to the state of sleep or the sleep–wake transition. By convention, parasomnias causing abnormal arousals from deep non-REM sleep, such as sleepwalking or night terrors, will not be covered, although restless legs syndrome is discussed, partly because of its close association with periodic limb movements during sleep.",

      "title": "Hearing Loss in Adults: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment.",
      "abstract": "More than 30 million U.S. adults have hearing loss. This condition is underrecognized, and hearing aids and other hearing enhancement technologies are underused. Hearing loss is categorized as conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Age-related sensorineural hearing loss (i.e., presbycusis) is the most common type in adults. Several approaches can be used to screen for hearing loss, but the benefits of screening are uncertain. Patients may present with self-recognized hearing loss, or family members may observe behaviors (e.g., difficulty understanding conversations, increasing television volume) that suggest hearing loss. Patients with suspected hearing loss should undergo in-office hearing tests such as the whispered voice test or audiometry. Patients should then undergo examination for cerumen impaction, exostoses, and other abnormalities of the external canal and tympanic membrane, in addition to a neurologic examination. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (loss of 30 dB or more within 72 hours) requires prompt otolaryngology referral. Laboratory evaluation is not indicated unless systemic illness is suspected. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is indicated in patients with asymmetrical hearing loss or sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and when ossicular chain damage is suspected. Treating cerumen impaction with irrigation or curettage is potentially curative. Other aspects of treatment include auditory rehabilitation, education, and eliminating or reducing use of ototoxic medications. Patients with sensorineural hearing loss should be referred to an audiologist for consideration of hearing aids. Patients with conductive hearing loss or sensorineural loss that does not improve with hearing aids should be referred to an otolaryngologist. Cochlear implants can be helpful for those with refractory or severe hearing loss.",

      "title": "Relationship Between Sleep Disorders and Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

Although some may be dramatic and worrying to parents, they do not usually mean that the child is psychologically disturbed or medically ill in any way. Very often, parasomnias stop of their own accord after a while, but safety measures may be necessary in the meantime in some of them. Occasionally, sleep disorders of this type are part of a medical or psychological disorder that needs treatment in its own right. Many parasomnias can be grouped according to when at night they occur.",

In a new study, 125 SD were examined on 93 depressed patients. The therapeutic benefit of SD on endogenous depression consists not only of the nightly clear up but also of provoking or improving a typical day wave the day after DS. A period of at least 36 h is necessary to survey the total effect of this method. The best results are achieved in patients with severe endogenous depression, especially in those with the typical day wave and distinct somatic symptoms. The effect of partial SD (for the second half of the night) is almost the same as that of total SD. The advantages of partial SD are: the patient can stand it easier, more often, and - in the company of a suited person - even at home.

Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncope» state (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn meaning «with, together» and koptein — «to cut off, tear off»), and is characterized by a short-term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which people come to their senses on their own. After fainting, feelings of general weakness, overexhaustion, and fatigue are possible; for elderly people, the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is typical. In the vast majority of cases, syncope is of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting is associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Notably, in some cases the cause of syncope cannot be established [4].",

(4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention.

Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

After successful treatment of neonatal hyperammonemic coma these infants can easily become hyperammonemic again despite appropriate treatment; they typically require liver transplant by age six months to improve quality of life. Males and heterozygous females with post-neonatal-onset (partial) OTC deficiency can present from infancy to later childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. No matter how mild the disease, a hyperammonemic crisis can be precipitated by stressors and become a life-threatening event at any age and in any situation in life. For all individuals with OTC deficiency, typical neuropsychological complications include developmental delay, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and executive function deficits. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OTC deficiency is established in a male proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and/or at least ONE of the following: A hemizygous pathogenic variant in OTC by molecular genetic testing A markedly abnormal increase of orotic acid excretion after an allopurinol challenge test Decreased OTC enzyme activity in liver The diagnosis of OTC deficiency is usually established in a female proband with the suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and/or with at least ONE of the following: A heterozygous pathogenic variant in OTC by molecular genetic testing A markedly abnormal increase of orotic acid excretion after an allopurinol challenge test Measurement of OTC enzyme activity in liver is not a reliable means of diagnosis in females. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is best provided by a clinical geneticist and a nutritionist experienced in the treatment of metabolic disease; treatment of hyperammonemic coma should be provided by a team coordinated by a metabolic specialist in a tertiary care center experienced in the management of OTC deficiency. The mainstays of treatment of the acute phase are rapid lowering of the plasma ammonia level to ≤200 μmol/L (if necessary, with renal replacement therapy); use of ammonia scavenger treatment to allow excretion of excess nitrogen via alternative pathways; reversal of catabolism; and reducing the risk of neurologic damage. The goals of long-term treatment are to promote growth and development and to prevent hyperammonemic episodes. In severe, neonatal-onset urea cycle disorders, liver transplantation is typically performed by age six months to prevent further hyperammonemic crises and neurodevelopmental deterioration. In females and males with partial OTC deficiency liver transplant is typically considered in those who have frequent hyperammonemic episodes. Complications of OTC deficiency, including ADHD and learning disability/intellectual disability, are treated according to the standard of care for these conditions while monitoring for signs of liver disease. Prevention of primary manifestations: If neonatal-onset OTC deficiency is diagnosed prenatally, intravenous (IV) treatment with ammonia scavengers within a few hours of birth (before the ammonia level rises) can prevent a hyperammonemic crisis and coma. For preventive measures after the neonatal period see Treatment of manifestations. Prevention of secondary complications: Avoid overrestriction of protein/amino acids; use gastrostomy tube feedings as needed to help avoid malnutrition; practice careful hand hygiene among all who have contact with the affected individual to minimize risk of infection; give immunizations on the usual schedule, including annual flu vaccine; provide multivitamin and vitamin D supplementation; and use antipyretics appropriately (e.g., ibuprofen is preferred over acetaminophen because of the potential for liver toxicity). Surveillance: At the start of therapy, routine measurement of plasma ammonia and plasma amino acids. Assess liver function (depending on symptoms) every three to six months or more often when previously abnormal. Perform neuropsychological testing at the time of expected significant developmental milestones. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproate, haloperidol, systemic corticosteroids, fasting, and physical and psychological stress. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the family is known and if prenatal testing has not been performed, it is appropriate to perform biochemical and molecular genetic testing on at-risk newborns (males and females) as soon after birth as possible so that the appropriate treatment or surveillance (for those with the family-specific pathogenic variant) can be promptly established. If the pathogenic variant in the family is NOT known, biochemical analysis (plasma amino acid analysis, ammonia level), an allopurinol challenge test (in older individuals), and/or OTC enzyme activity measurement in liver (males only) can be performed. Preventive measures at birth should be instituted until such a time as the diagnosis can be ruled out. Pregnancy management: Heterozygous females are at risk of becoming catabolic during pregnancy and especially in the postpartum period. Those who are symptomatic need to be treated throughout pregnancy as necessary; those who are asymptomatic need to avoid catabolism in the peripartum and postpartum periods and should be treated as needed. Genetic counseling OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked manner. If an affected male reproduces, none of his sons will be affected and all of his daughters will inherit the pathogenic variant and may or may not develop clinical symptoms related to the disorder. Heterozygous females have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant with each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant may or may not develop clinical findings related to the disorder. Carrier testing for females at risk of being heterozygous and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the OTC pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.",

      "title": "Current Problems in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA QUENTIN R. REGESTEIN* and PETER REICHf Recently, interest has grown in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Over 2 decades of laboratory research have yielded information that may further rationalize treatment ofdisordered sleep. Reviews have appeared discussing newer understanding and treatments for sleep problems [1, 2], and attempts are being made to forge standardized classifications for sleep disorders. Special clinics for the management of these problems are now being organized upon the notion that greater specificity in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders is at hand. Insomnia is perhaps the most common sleep disorder faced by physicians . Insomnia must be distinguished from lack of sleep. Only a tinyfraction of insomniacs is ever objectively examined for the amount of sleep actually obtained, and such examinations when done last but 1 or 2 nights. The results of the examination, when done, are not always consistent with the patient's estimation of sleep loss, yet the patient may continue to complain of insomnia in the absence of objective substantiation ofsleep loss and persist in his demands for relief. For these reasons, we define insomnia as the complaint of sleep loss. Despite the years of clinical experience in treating insomnia and the added understanding of sleep more recently accrued from research, there remain several problems that prevent agreement on how to classify insomnia. Specificity in diagnosing and treating insomnia is therefore hindered. This paper is meant to articulate these problems in order to reconcile for the practitioner the broad, prolonged clinical experience accumulated with insomnia and the relative lack of specificity for its treatment. We will attempt to describe some of the difficulties surround- *Sleep Clinic, Division of Psychiatry, Department of Medicine, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 721 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; associate in medicine and assistant professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School. tPhysician, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; and associate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.© 1978 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/78/2102-0006S01.00 232 I Quentin R. Regestein and Peter Reich ¦ Chronic Insomnia ing both the diagnosis and the treatment of insomnia, in order, we hope, to guide further attempts to understand and relieve insomnia patients. Diagnosis Five percent of adult patients from a general medical practice presented complained of insomnia [3], 20 percent in a similar group admitted some sort of sleep disturbance [3], and 45 percent of adults in an epidemiological survey reported difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep [4]. This remarkable prevalence may contribute to the lack of systematic classification for insomnia. Chronic insomnia is so common that some may consider it a normal experience rather than a pathological problem [5]. Although chronic insomnia may signify severe mental or physical derangement and correlate with augmented death rates [6], much insomnia is mild and temporary. A complaint that subsides rather than persists excites little interest. Nevertheless, much insomnia remains chronic, poses great difficulty for patient and practitioner, and still remains unclassified. The frequency of psychopathology among insomniac patients provides a second reason why insomnia has not been classified. Insomnia can stem from mental problems of all kinds, and many of these are not rapidly treatable. Chronic insomniacs are said to be complaining, oversensitive people [7]. In two series ofinsomnia patients, over 85% ofthose 274 subjects tested showed pathological scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an elevation in the depression scale being most common [8, 9]. Even poor sleepers, discovered through research questionnaires rather than through clinical practice, prove to be anxious, depressed, obsessively worried types [10]. Furthermore, many insomniac patients depend on drugs [H]. Chronic insomnia, therefore, associated with chronic psychological troubles and complicated by drug abuse, may be considered an unattractive problem by many physicians. In these respects it resembles alcoholism by inviting disproportionately small clinical interest. Perhaps, for this reason, characterizing insomnia has recently been left to the psychiatrists, even though prescribing for insomnia is done mostly by other physicians [12]. Certain difficulties arise whenever conditions involving much psychopathology are categorized. The rich diversity of personalities and psychological disorders are not neatly categorized. They are, furthermore , enmeshed in the unique complexity of behavioral traits that characterize every person. Psychiatric nosology, therefore...",

      "abstract": "Perhaps as many as 5% of adults are excessively sleepy to a clinically relevant extent.1 The comparable figure for children is not known, but sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, although a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychological and social disadvantage.2Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not the rarity once supposed, and poses special problems of recognition and management, especially in young people. The purpose of this article is mainly to review the clinical picture of narcolepsy in children and adolescents, emphasising the need for paediatricians, child psychiatrists, and others to take a wide view of the ways in which the condition can show itself. The clinical picture is often very different from that of the fully developed narcolepsy syndrome in adults. It is, therefore, at particular risk of either being overlooked or misconstrued.\n\nNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder, the main classic feature of which is excessive sleepiness during the day, with recurrent episodes of irresistible sleep (sleep attacks). In its fully developed form the “narcolepsy syndrome” also includes sudden loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (cataplexy), vivid dream-like experiences before falling asleep (hypnagogic hallucinations) or on waking (hypnopompic hallucinations), and episodes of inability to move after waking in the morning (sleep paralysis). Estimates for the occurrence of the non-sleepiness (“ancillary”) components of the syndrome are: cataplexy (all cases where cataplexy is required for the diagnosis of narcolepsy; however, others accept that in about 20% of cases cataplexy is not present), hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations (50–60%), and sleep paralysis (40%). These symptoms occur in various combinations and less than half of those with narcolepsy develop all four of them. In narcolepsy, overnight sleep is generally disrupted, causing some degree …",

A brief history of the SCT construct is provided, followed by a review of the current research supporting SCT as distinct from ADHD and other psychopathologies. SCT is positively associated with ADHD inattentive symptoms, depression, anxiety, and daytime sleepiness, but is unassociated or negatively associated with externalizing behaviours such as hyperactivity-impulsivity, oppositionality, and aggression. A growing body of research also demonstrates that SCT is uniquely associated with poorer functioning in various domains of major life activities, including academic difficulties (including poor organization, homework problems, and lower grade point average), social problems (especially peer withdrawal and isolation), and emotion dysregulation. SCT is less clearly associated with most neuropsychological performance outcomes with the possible exceptions of sustained attention, processing speed, and motor speed.",

      "abstract": "We report a girl 3 years and 6 months old with onset of aphasia at age 3 years and 3 months. There was no evidence of brain damage and there were no seizures. The neuropsychological evaluation showed that the girl tended to be right-handed, that aphasia was global and that other higher cortical functions seemed to be preserved. Isolated spikes and spikes-and-wave were recorded during wake over the right temporal region with rare independent contralateral abnormalities. During polysomnography (PSG), the physiological patterns of sleep were preserved and right temporal epileptiform discharges were significantly increased in all sleep stages. Maximal activation was obtained at sleep onset and during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep periods, when focal abnormalities became continuous and spread contralaterally. Repeat PSGs showed that the activation profile retained this particular trait, although subclinical discharges tended to increase during slow wave sleep (SWS). This pattern of subclinical temporal status epilepticus during REM sleep differs from the characteristic activation profile found in the syndrome of continuous spikes-and-waves during SWS. However, this profile was transient and all epileptiform changes disappeared during clinical recovery at 18 months of follow-up.",

Injury at or above the sixth thoracic spinal cord segment frequently leads to dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, which results in a syndrome called autonomic hyperreflexia or dysreflexia. It is a hypertensive crisis triggered by visceral or somatic stimuli below the level of the injury and caused by sympathetic spinal reflexes not modulated by regulatory centers in the brain. Patients with spinal cord injuries frequently undergo surgery for multiple reasons. Because of the potentially lethal complications of autonomic hyperreflexia, physicians, and in particular anaesthesiologists, must be aware of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and adequate perioperative management.Les lésions de la moelle épinière peuvent avoir de nombreuses conséquences autres que la perturbation des fonctions sensitives et motrices. Une lésion d’un niveau médullaire supérieur ou égal au sixième segment thoracique (T6) entraîne, fréquemment, une dysrégulation du système nerveux autonome et le développement d’un syndrome appelé hyperréflexie ou dysréflexie autonome. Il s’agit d’une crise hypertensive déclenchée par des stimuli viscéraux ou somatiques sous le niveau de la lésion et causée par des réflexes sympathiques médullaires non modulés par les centres régulateurs encéphaliques. Les patients porteurs de lésions médullaires bénéficient, régulièrement, d’interventions chirurgicales pour des raisons multiples.

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms.

Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

      "title": "Serotonin syndrome with a combination of aripiprazole and fluoxetine: a case report",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

Postural hypotension may be a presenting feature in certain autonomic disorders (such as pure autonomic failure), it may be a pointer towards an alternative diagnosis (as in multiple system atrophy presenting with parkinsonian features), and it may complicate drug therapy (as with levodopa). Postural hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and also mortality, especially in elderly people, in whom falls result in injuries. Advances have resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes, and in the treatment of postural hypotension.\n\nPostural hypotension usually is considered when there are characteristic features resulting from cerebral ischaemia such as loss of consciousness (fainting, syncope). Other symptoms may occur (table1).2 Measuring blood pressure while lying and after 2 minutes of standing often confirms a postural fall. However, the lack of a fall, in the presence of suggestive symptoms, should warrant further investigation. There are various disorders, including the chronic fatigue syndrome and the postural tachycardia syndrome, in which postural intolerance may not be accompanied by hypotension. Additional factors may be needed to unmask postural hypotension (table2), especially in mild to moderate autonomic failure.\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 1 \nSome of the symptoms resulting from postural hypotension, and impaired perfusion of various organs\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 2 \nFactors that may influence postural hypotension\n\n\n\nFurther evaluation is best undertaken in an autonomic laboratory.

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia typically associated with synucleinopathy and evolving to neurodegenerative disorders. RBD is caused by impairment of brainstem nuclei controlling REM sleep muscle atonia. Rarely, focal lesions of the brainstem can cause secondary RBD. We present the case of a 74-year-old patient, previously evaluated at age 70 years for insomnia and periodic limb movements during sleep, who then rapidly developed unpleasant dreams with minor motor behavior, affecting his sleep quality. Polysomnography recorded REM sleep without atonia and motor behaviors in REM sleep. Ischemic lesions in the pons were detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, biological, and instrumental biomarkers of neurodegeneration were repeatedly negative at 2 years' follow-up. Although rare, a lesional cause of RBD must be considered in cases of atypical presentation and without evidence of neurodegeneration. The complaint of unpleasant dreams suggests a possible role of brainstem nuclei controlling REM sleep atonia in affecting oneiric content.Biscarini F, Montini A, Antelmi E, Vandi S, Pizza F, Plazzi G.

Only a few reports exist on the practical aspects of sleep deprivation. The present article informs about the \"stay awake\"-therapy on 101 depressive patients (in the mean 25 patient-nights per month), carried out at the Psychiatric Hospital Sanatorium Kilchberg/Zurich. The patients (age between 19 and 76, mean 47 years) participated on average in 4.4 partial sleep deprivations. 72% participated at least for a set of three nights. One staff person takes care of a group of at most five patients. Indication, organisation, night programme, care and possible strains are reported. A stay awake night (three times a week) consists of breakfast, games, conversations, taking two walks, and discussions about depression and about treatment (psychoeducation), with the aim to avoid naps and to provide a pleasant social event.

Although more problems arise while performing attention tasks than memory tasks, the neuropsychological test inquiry doesn't indicate one particular neuropsychological function as consistently impaired.

Neurophysiological research indicates that the sometimes occurring cognitive dysfunction is associated with a waxing and waning between wakefulness and sleep.

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "abstract": "Primary hyperparathyroidism is a not uncommon disease in the elderly. A prevalence of 3% for women and 1% for men is reported in subjects aged 65 years and over. Routine serum calcium determination and parathyroid hormone radioimmuno-assay allow to make an early diagnosis in still asymptomatic subjects. In the elderly the clinical features of the disease are often aspecific presenting with psychiatric and/or neuromuscular and/or cardiovascular disorders. This report refers to a 75 year-old woman admitted to our Department with a suspicion of senile dementia. She was affected by loss of memory, hallucinations, nausea, loss of appetite, mild polydipsia and polyuria. The patient was dependent in one activity of daily living (Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, ADL) and partially dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, IADL). The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) showed mild mental impairment and mild depression. Routine biochemical screening revealed a significant hypercalcemia. Parathormon assay and parathyroid scintigram were performed to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. After treatment of dehydratation and hypercalcemia, parathyroidectomy was performed: a single parathyroid adenoma was found and removed. On discharge the patient was lucid and able to carry out all ADLs and IADLs.",

      "title": "NARCOLEPTIC SYNDROME AND PARADOXICAL SLEEP",
      "abstract": "S ummary In order to elucidate the mechanism of the narcoleptic syndrome, the course of all‐night sleep was investigated by means of poly graphic methods or by using inducing stimuli. Further study on each symptom was performed in relation to the sleep mechanism using similar methods. Thirty‐three cases of typical narcolepsy were examined. The results from these studies are summarized as follows. 1. The paradoxical phase of sleep occurs immediately after sleep onset in the natural nocturnal sleep of narcoleptics. The proportion of sleep time spent in the paradoxical phase (30%) in narcoleptics is higher than in normals, whereas that of the deep sleep stage is lower. 2. In narcolepsy, hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis appear mostly during the paradoxical phase. During these episodes the level of cerebral vigilance ascends temporarily but slight differences are found between these two episodes. The responses to the stimuli (auditory evoked response, the H reflex and the knee jerk) are similar to those in normals in each stage of sleep. 3. Chlorpromazine, being effective against hypnagogic hallucination and sleep disturbance, stabilizes a night's sleep and prolongs the duration of deep sleep and the paradoxical phase. Imipramine with a suppressing action on cataplectic attack, inhibits the occurrence of the paradoxical phase at sleep onset and diminishes the following paradoxical phases, accompanied by a decrease of hypnagogic hallucination. 4. The level of wakefulness tends to descend easily in narcoleptics. In sleep attacks, the subjects fall rapidly into the paradoxical phase from alert or drowsy state. Both sleep attacks and a tendency to fall asleep are apt to occur periodically in the daytime with lucid intervals. 5. A cataplectic attack closely relates to the paradoxical phase. During the episode, a great discrepancy is found between hypofunction of the arousal system and function of the motor and autonomic systems. Cataplectic occur frequently concomitant with the sleeping‐waking rhythm. 6. Fundamental disorders of narcolepsy are considered as follows: the abnormal occurrence of the paradoxical phase of sleep, the tendency to fall asleep easily, the sleep cycle through night and day and the remarkable dissociation of the arousal system from the motor or autonomic systems. Accordingly, disorders in the sleep‐wakefulness regulating mechanisms are found. Dysfunction of the brain stem reticular formation, especially in the pons, and disturbances of the interrelationship among them are discussed.",

The list of possibilities spans virtually every major area of medicine, neurology and psychiatry. A clear, detailed history is invaluable in negotiating these numerous diagnostic considerations; however, the symptom may be expressed in terms that do not directly denote somnolence (e.g. `tiredness' or `fatigue'). Accurate diagnosis is important, not only because of the negative impacts of sleepiness and its root causes on health and social function, but because excessive sleepiness is generally remediable with appropriate treatment.

He did not have enough concentration and energy for his daily work and developed depression and anxiety because of his excessive daytime sleepiness. During his insomniac state, a drug treatment provided partial relief, but the effects were not long-lasting. Consequently, the drug dosage increased, and major side effects gradually manifested. We decided to use a completely new therapeutic strategy for this patient to improve his sleep quality and mental symptoms. In time, the patient could stop oral medications and that is multimodal sleep. After the end of multimodal sleep, the patient typically experiences improvement in sleep quality and architecture.

      "title": "Rhythmicity in heart rate and its surges usher a special period of sleep, a likely home for PGO waves",
      "abstract": "High amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG) events, like unitary K-complex (KC), are used to partition sleep into stages and hence define the hypnogram, a key instrument of sleep medicine. Throughout sleep the heart rate (HR) changes, often as a steady HR increase leading to a peak, what is known as a heart rate surge (HRS). The hypnogram is often unavailable when most needed, when sleep is disturbed and the graphoelements lose their identity. The hypnogram is also difficult to define during normal sleep, particularly at the start of sleep and the periods that precede and follow rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here, we use objective quantitative criteria that group together periods that cannot be assigned to a conventional sleep stage into what we call REM0 periods, with the presence of a HRS one of their defining properties. Extended REM0 periods are characterized by highly regular sequences of HRS that generate an infra-low oscillation around 0.05 Hz. During these regular sequence of HRS, and just before each HRS event, we find avalanches of high amplitude events for each one of the mass electrophysiological signals, i.e. related to eye movement, the motor system and the general neural activity. The most prominent features of long REM0 periods are sequences of three to five KCs which we label multiple K-complexes (KCm). Regarding HRS, a clear dissociation is demonstrated between the presence or absence of high gamma band spectral power (55–95 Hz) of the two types of KCm events: KCm events with strong high frequencies (KCmWSHF) cluster just before the peak of HRS, while KCm between HRS show no increase in high gamma band (KCmNOHF). Tomographic estimates of activity from magnetoencephalography (MEG) in pre-KC periods (single and multiple) showed common increases in the cholinergic Nucleus Basalis of Meynert in the alpha band. The direct contrast of KCmWSHF with KCmNOHF showed increases in all subjects in the high sigma band in the base of the pons and in three subjects in both the delta and high gamma bands in the medial Pontine Reticular Formation (mPRF), the putative Long Lead Initial pulse (LLIP) for Ponto-Geniculo-Occipital (PGO) waves.",

      "title": "Fatigue and brain arousal in patients with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is considered a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet the term lacks specificity. It can denote a state of increased sleepiness and lack of drive (i.e., downregulated arousal) as well as a state of high inner tension and inhibition of drive with long sleep onset latencies (i.e., upregulated arousal), the latter typically found in depression. It has been proposed to differentiate fatigue along the dimension of brain arousal. We investigated whether such stratification within a group of MDD patients would reveal a subgroup with distinct clinical features. Using an automatic classification of EEG vigilance stages, an arousal stability score was calculated for 15-min resting EEGs of 102 MDD patients with fatigue. 23.5% of the patients showed signs of hypoarousal with EEG patterns indicating drowsiness or sleep; this hypoaroused subgroup was compared with remaining patients (non-hypoaroused subgroup) concerning self-rated measures of depressive symptoms, sleepiness, and sleep. The hypoaroused subgroup scored higher on the Beck Depression Inventory items “loss of energy” ( Z = − 2.13, p = 0.033; ɳ 2 = 0.044, 90% CI 0.003–0.128) and “concentration difficulty” ( Z = − 2.40, p = 0.017; ɳ 2 = 0.056, 90% CI 0.009–0.139), and reported higher trait and state sleepiness ( p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the non-hypoaroused group. The non-hypoaroused subgroup, in contrast, reported more frequently the presence of suicidal ideation (Chi 2 = 3.81, p = 0.051; ɳ 2 = 0.037, 90% CI 0.0008–0.126). In this study, we found some evidence that stratifying fatigued MDD patients by arousal may lead to subgroups that are pathophysiologically and clinically more homogeneous. Brain arousal may be a worth while target in clinical research for better understanding the mechanisms underlying suicidal tendencies and to improve treatment response.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years.

It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

It is a rare, moderately severe headache that occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients and affects both sexes. It appears exclusively during sleep and often with alarm clock regularity. The attack lasts from two to 6 hours, it may be unilateral or diffuse, pulsating or boring, without autonomic system features. Case 1. A 49 year old man reported the history of two week nocturnal headache that awakened him every night from sleep. The headache lasted two hours. There were no autonomic system features. Case 2. A 52 year old man suffered from nocturnal headaches for 6 weeks. The pain occurred between 2 and 5 almost every night and woke the patient. He suffered from diabetes mellitus too. Both patients were treated with flunarizine with good results.",

The morphology of epileptiform discharges may also be affected by sleep, with a change or breakdown of the generalized pattern in generalized epilepsy, but a better definition of sharp waves in partial epilepsy, during nonREM sleep. One notes a predilection for certain types of epilepsy to occur in sleep, such as benign focal epilepsy of childhood, or to occur shortly after awakening (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Epilepsy may disrupt the sleep architecture with an increase in light sleep and a decrease in deep sleep, and an increase in awake time after sleep onset. Sleep is an important activator of IEA and is of value both in the routine EEG evaluation of epilepsy as well as in more prolonged studies used in epilepsy monitoring units.",

The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD. Sleep problems tended to be associated with more severe motor symptoms, longer disease duration, depression, and longer duration of levodopa treatment. Half of patients with MSA with sleep disorders complained of daytime somnolence compared with 30% of patients with PD. Daytime somnolence was significantly associated with disease severity in MSA. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study shows that sleep disorders are more common in patients with MSA than in those with PD after the same duration of the disease, reflecting the more diffuse underlying pathological process in MSA.",

      "abstract": "The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been used for many years to describe disturbances of mood or physical symptoms occurring regularly 7–10 days before menses and remitting during menses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) included PMS among the ‘proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study’ under the name of Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), and established among its diagnostic criteria the need for daily prospective symptoms self-ratings during at least two cycles, for confirmation [1]. The more recent fourth edition of DSM maintained PMS among the categories needing further study, adding the new category of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. PMDD is distinguished from PMS in several respects: It requires at least one mood symptom; the symptoms must be severe enough to cause functional impairment, and they must not be a mere exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. Since no other diagnostic criteria have been proposed, many studies have compared the scores from the premenstrual and follicular phases: a 30–50% increase found in prospectively administered diaries is now normally accepted as an indicator of the diagnosis of PMS [3], no attention being paid to the quality of symptoms. On the other hand, no specific hormone changes or other biological markers are able to distinguish between PMS sufferers and normal women [4]. Therefore, the absence of both a universally accepted definition and an objective biological or clinical marker makes it impossible to study the etiology of PMS. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach is presently indefinite. Steinberg [5] correctly stated that the time-honored medical adage maintaining that ‘in the absence of cure, treatments multiply’ seems to be appropriate to PMS. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the severe form of PMS, i.e. the one characterized by psychosocial impairment and thus requiring medical treatment, is present in 5–8% of women during their 40s. This implies that we should multiply our efforts toward the understanding of the disorder.",

During wakefulness and NREM sleep, the hypothalamus plays a central role in thermoregulation. REM sleep has a very distinct thermoregulatory response that is characterized by an inhibition of hypothalamic control over body temperature, with resulting poikilothermia. The role of the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep is currently unknown. Drawing conclusions from other parasomnias one can assume that a disorder could exist in which the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep are impaired. The existence of this condition may have eluded current research because most of the research on thermoregulation has been completed using animal models or healthy volunteers. If this disorder were to exist, it could be associated with metabolic disorders, or with neurodegenerative conditions, and perhaps it could be an early biomarker for alpha-synucleinopathies in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. New and evolving wearable technologies offer the promise of facilitating the monitoring of core body temperature and the testing of this hypothesized thermoregulatory autonomic disorder and its clinical correlates.",

      "title": "Case Study : Prognosis of Recurrent Depressive Disorder with Somatic Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is a common disease worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. Especially if it lasts a long time and is of moderate or severe intensity, depression can be a serious health condition. Depression can cause affected people to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school, and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. In general, the good prognosis of depressive episodes can be achieved as well as good response to treatment and early interventions, but with the absence of any other complication such as psychotic symptoms and somatic complaints. This paper discusses the prognosis of recurrent depressive disorders with somatic complaints through a case study. Case: Male 23 years old complained of headaches that did not improve with pain medication and often recurred for two weeks, feels tingling and heavy in the back, worsening at night, interfere with the patient's daily activities and sleep in the night. These depressive symptoms have recurred since the patient was 19 years old. The patient experienced repeated stress due to arguments between his parents who were often involved in verbal abuse. The patient's prognosis is analyzed using several aspects according to Maramis prognosis analysis, including age, premorbid personality, type of disorder, course of treatment, hereditary factors, and the presence/absence of precipitating factors. Discussion: According to the course of the disease, the patient experienced recurrent depression since the age of less than 20 years, with somatic symptoms currently accompanying his depressive disorder. The patient experienced repeated recurrences even though he was stated to have improved by the treating doctor, which indicates that the patient's stress management was inadequate. The patient is currently experiencing a skin disorder that worsens his pessimistic feelings and is receiving SSRI antidepressants to improve his depressive symptoms. Based on the analysis of the course of the disease, the prognosis for depressive disorders in patients is poor, or dubia ad bonam. Conclusions: Recurrent depressive disorders involving younger ages, complications such as somatic symptoms, suboptimal social support, inadequate coping mechanisms, will worsen the prognosis of depression even after receiving adequate treatment",

      "title": "Report from the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Psychiatry and Sleep‐Wakefulness Disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, which is considered a psychiatric disorder itself, is the most common sleep-related complaint in the general population. Furthermore, complaints about sleep and wakefulness are among the most common and impairing symptoms in psychiatric patients. Disturbed sleep frequently precedes the onset of several mental disorders, exacerbates as mental disorders progress, and frequently presents as a residual and treatment-resistant symptom. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in sleep research and the treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders in psychiatry, although many questions remain to be answered1. We still do not know exactly the causative link(s) between the various psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints, although it would be important to know, for instance, whether early treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent the development of depressive disorders. Moreover, the relationship between subjective complaints of insomnia patients and objective polysomnographic results remains elusive, and we do not know whether the health consequences of insomnia, for example on metabolic systems, are related to subjective or objective measures of sleep, or both. Besides objective methods for assessing sleep and wakefulness – such as polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, multiple sleep latency test, and maintenance of wakefulness test – there is now considerable literature on various biomarkers for sleep disorders. For insomnia, the measures with the highest performance include PSG-derived cyclic alternating patterns, actigraphy, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These are followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and specific neuroimaging patterns, mainly reflecting the activity of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia2. For central disorders of hypersomnolence, novel measures derived from quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), high-density EEG, cognitive testing, structural and functional neuroimaging, and pupillometry have been proposed3. Significant progress has also been made in the assessment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In addition to established laboratory protocols, circadian rhythms can now be assessed through long-term ambulatory monitoring of activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and light exposure4. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of insomnia, emphasizing not only the role of appropriate pharmacotherapy but, above all, non-pharmacological treatment options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently recommended as the evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic insomnia, also in patients with comorbidities5. This treatment includes techniques such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep education and hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. These techniques help strengthen the basic sleep-regulating mechanisms, including the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, and reduce sleep-related anxiety and arousal6. The treatment of insomnia in psychiatry should be based on an integration of pharmacotherapy (including novel medications, such as orexin antagonists) and non-pharmacological interventions, to address psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to the development or persistence of insomnia. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, getting up at the same time every day, even after a night of poor sleep, and to exercise regularly. Additionally, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting naps and rest periods during the day are essential. To prevent insomnia, it is also important to limit screen time during the day and avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least one hour before bed. Several new wakefulness-promoting agents have been introduced for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence7. Moreover, it is now well recognized that effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with mental disorders is critical for improving their response to treatment, quality of life, and overall health7. As the prevalence of sleep and wakefulness disorders has further increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in deterioration of mental health and increased alcohol and hypnotic use8, it is evident that mental health professionals require effective training in diagnosing and treating disrupted sleep. People with mental disorders can greatly benefit from mental health services that incorporate routine assessment and treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders within standard care pathways. Consequently, the main aim of the WPA Section on Psychiatry and Sleep-Wakefulness Disorders is to educate psychiatrists in recognizing and giving appropriate attention to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia and hypersomnolence) and in being able to provide guidance to their patients on the importance of basic sleep hygiene rules. The education of psychiatrists should also include awareness on obstructive sleep apnea, which can manifest with psychiatric symptoms, including increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue or loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, mood swings, emotional instability, and cognitive dysfunction such as impaired memory, attention and executive functions. These psychiatric manifestations highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea promptly, as managing the sleep disorder can improve overall well-being and quality of life. Moreover, since 30-40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfill diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea, screening for this condition should be performed before initiating any hypnotic medication. This is crucial, because medications such as benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Such screening can be performed with short questionnaires such as the STOP-BANG. This questionnaire consists of eight yes-or-no questions, focusing on snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, pressure (high blood pressure), body mass index, age, neck circumference, and gender (male). Each \"yes\" answer scores one point. A higher total score indicates a greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea9. Our WPA Section has been active for many years. Its activities have been focused on providing information about sleep and sleep-related disorders to clinical health professionals, as well as optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances in patients with mental disorders. Since sleep is an interdisciplinary field, one of our main goals is to connect sleep specialists from around the world. We believe that our Section can mediate between basic researchers, clinicians, educational institutions, scientific professional societies, health care institutions, and governmental authorities, in order to improve the recognition and treatment of sleep disorders. Our Section's action plan for 2023-2026 includes several goals. A primary one is advancing research and knowledge about disturbances of sleep and wakefulness in patients with mental disorders, by fostering collaboration between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and health care providers. Additionally, we will keep focusing on education and training on diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, by organizing workshops, webinars and scientific conferences with WPA involvement. Furthermore, we will be active in promoting clinical practice guidelines, to improve the quality and interdisciplinary nature of care in people with mental disorders suffering from disturbed sleep. A major goal also pertains to engaging in policy and advocacy, by calling for pertinent actions in support of research and public health initiatives to improve access of patients with mental disorders to sleep medicine services. We will also be supporting the building up of networking and collaboration, by fostering relationships with scientific societies to promote interdisciplinary research and clinical care. To this end, our Section has already organized a highly successful symposium, \"State of the Art in the Management of Insomnia\", during the World Congress of Psychiatry in 2023. Finally, we intend to develop public sleep health campaigns to educate the public on sleep hygiene, health consequences of poor sleep, and prevention of sleep disorders. By implementing this action plan, our Section can play a pivotal role in advancing the field, improving patient care, and promoting the importance of sleep health in the broader mental health context.",

Recently, restless sleep disorder (RSD) has been identified as a new pediatric sleep disorder with core features of restless sleep and frequent large muscle movements during sleep, which are not explained by other conditions. Based on the medical literature and expert clinical experience, the task force developed a consensus diagnostic criteria for RSD and scoring large muscle group movements in children aged 6–18 years. Eight essential criteria of RSD include a complaint of restless sleep, observed large body movements during sleep, video-polysomnographic documentation of ≥5 large body movements/hour, occurrence at least thrice weekly for at least 3 months, clinically significant impairment, and differentiation from other conditions that may secondarily cause restless sleep. There is evidence to support a pathophysiology based on iron deficiency, sleep instability, and increased sympathetic activation, and treatment options include oral or intravenous iron supplementation. This review describes the key features of RSD, potential pathophysiology, and current treatment options to help diagnose patients with RSD, which has been overlooked.",

      "abstract": "• The development, clinical course, and electrophysiologic characteristics of narcolepsy were evaluated in 50 adults who had a current complaint of sleep attacks and cataplexy. In most of the patients, the first symptoms, usually excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks, developed during childhood or adolescence. The condition was invariably chronic. Patients frequently had family histories of some disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness. In nocturnal sleep or daytime nap recordings, all but three of the patients demonstrated a rapid-eyemovement (REM) period at sleep onset. Sleep apnea was found in only one patient. Our findings indicate that sleep laboratory recordings to detect a sleep-onset REM period are of little diagnostic value when the narcoleptic patient has cataplexy. Furthermore, narcoleptic patients require sleep laboratory evaluation for sleep apnea only when the presence of apnea is suggested by the sleep history.",

      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

Its primary symptoms are \"severe, recurrent temper outbursts\" (manifested verbally and/or physically) superimposed on and associated with chronic irritability. DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder. Keywords: bipolar disorder, circadian rhythms, sleep–wake homeostasis",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent sleep-related breathing disorder in children with a prevalence of approximately 3% between the ages of 3 and 8. Its origin is multifactorial (hypertrophy of pharyngeal soft tissues, narrowing of the bone airways, damage to the neuromuscular tone). The symptoms and clinical signs to look for during the day and at night are directly related to upper airway (UA) obstruction or poor sleep quality. After a complete anamnestic and clinical evaluation, including nasofibroscopy, the ENT specialist will refer to an adeno-amygdalectomy or night recording by polysomnography or polygraph to confirm the diagnosis in the child. Among adolescents, the prevalence of OSAS is reported to be between 0.5 and 6%. The main risk factors are obesity, male sex and a history of tonsillectomy. In addition to the classic symptoms of childhood OSAS, this syndrome may, in adolescents, manifest itself as a misleading semiology of dyssomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and/or mood disorders. Differential diagnoses with risk behaviours, phase delay or narcolepsy should be systematically discussed. It is essential to record breathing during sleep. Even if the obstructive apnea/hypopnea index is low, it must be considered. In both children and adolescents, multidisciplinary management (ENT, orthodontist, maxillofacial physiotherapist, pulmonologist) should be early in order to avoid neurocognitive, behavioural, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Maxillofacial surgery can be discussed from the age of 15. It is important not to forget to pay attention to the rules of healthy living and sleep as well as the management of obesity.",

They were free of perinatal and postnatal complications other than apnea. During their active or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep they showed significantly more apneic episodes which were also longer lasting and they were accompanied by bradycardia of a greater severity. The organization of the immature nervous system with a preponderance of inhibitory synaptic connections and the additional inhibition of spinal motoneurons during REM sleep are likely to be the cause of apneic spells in otherwise \"normal\" preterm infants.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of ramelteon for residual sleep disturbances (hypersomnia) in a patient with premenstrual dysphoric disorder",
      "abstract": "One of the characteristic symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is sleep disturbance before menstruation, mainly involving hypersomnia, and insomnia can occur in some cases. In most PMDD patients, the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) leads to rapid resolution of symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, and affective lability. However, premenstrual sleep disturbances, such as hypersomnia and insomnia, may persist. I encountered a case in which ramelteon was effective for the treatment of residual sleep disturbances (hypersomnia) that persisted in a patient with PMDD even after SSRI therapy. Herein, I present my experience with this patient. The patient was a 29-year-old woman with a 4-year history of PMDD and no physical complications. Her menstrual cycle was 28 days in length. For 10 days before menstruation, she experienced symptoms such as marked affective lability, marked irritability and anger, marked depressed mood, marked anxiety and tension, decreased interest in usual activities, lethargy, marked lack of energy, cravings for sweet foods, excessive daytime sleepiness, and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Although most of her premenstrual symptoms showed resolution with an intermittent dosing regimen of escitalopram at 20 mg/day, the excessive daytime sleepiness and frequent nocturnal awakenings persisted from days 7 to 1 before menstruation began, disrupting her daily activities during this period. She expressed a strong desire for improvement in these premenstrual sleep problems. With the aim of ameliorating the frequent nocturnal awakenings, ramelteon was additionally administered at a dose of 8 mg/day at bedtime during the luteal phase only, which resulted in complete resolution of not only the frequent nocturnal awakenings, but also the excessive daytime sleepiness during her subsequent menstrual cycle. She gave informed consent for the publication of this description, and her anonymity has been preserved. I experienced a case of PMDD that responded favorably to additional administration of ramelteon. Many patients with PMDD experience premenstrual hypersomnia and insomnia, and they often do not respond adequately to SSRI. Ramelteon is a selective melatonin MT1/MT2 receptor agonist. Some studies have shown that melatonin function is lower during the luteal phase in patients with PMDD than during the follicular phase in patients with PMDD or during the luteal phase in healthy women.1, 2 As a melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon compensated for the decrease in melatonin function during the luteal phase in the present patient with PMDD, ameliorating both her frequent nocturnal awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness. Although the symptoms of PMDD are thought to be associated with abnormal functioning of the serotonergic system, my experience suggests that melatonin may also play a role in sleep-related symptoms such as hypersomnia and insomnia.

      "abstract": "Primary insomnia is a mental health problem that is often reported due to the combination of either difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep.It is known that people with primary insomnia experience an increased arousal of physiological, cognitive or emotional process, combined with negative conditioning that is associated with sleep.Progressive relaxation is one of the methods known to be effective in minimizing primary insomnia due to the person's need to release their tension.Frequently, the problem that causes primary insomnia derives from anxiety and muscle tension.Further work on the field is needed to show more the effectiveness of progressive relaxation in primary insomnia, especially in Indonesia, due to the lack of papers showing an intervention effect toward mental health problems.This paper presents a single case study of a graduate student who was diagnosed with primary insomnia.Graduate students are more likely to experience sleep deprivation, due to academic pressures and poor sleeping habits.Primary insomnia was diagnosed in this participant because they met the criteria of primary insomnia, such as frequent complaints of inability to fall asleep, and maintaining sleep for at least one month and an impairment in social and occupational functioning.It was shown during counseling that the participant was experiencing distress mainly caused by family problems.The participant felt burdened about the future due to their family's expectations on several subjects such as career, relationships and academic performance.The participant felt the need to fulfill all of the family's requirements.Another intervention, such as the ABC model from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), was needed due to the participant's negative core belief that made them unable to see their own positive traits.The participant also learned a mantra to cancel out unnecessary negative thoughts that caused sleep disturbance.The intervention was conducted for five sessions over a period of three weeks.The participant reported that before she was introduced to progressive relaxation, she had difficulty maintaining her sleep, she woke up five or six times during her sleep, and she was able to sleep only after midnight.After being taught progressive relaxation, the participant reported that her primary insomnia symptoms had decreased.She was able to sleep without any disturbance and fall sleep at 10 p.m.The participant's anxiety toward her family's expectations also decreased markedly.She reported that she was able to focus on what matters in the present, able to distinguish between her own needs and her family's expectations.Mantras were constantly used by the participant even a year after the intervention.She reported that using a mantra was the most efficient way for her to cancel out negative thoughts.This single case study showed that a short-term intervention was capable of providing an effective outcome for an individual with primary insomnia.It was also shown that progressive relaxation was successful in treating primary insomnia.This single case study showed the need to reduce anxiety for people with poor quality of sleep.It is suggested for further study to replicate progressive relaxation for reducing primary insomnia symptoms due to the successful outcome of this single case study.",

The global prevalence of OSA varies from 0.3% to 5.1% in general population.[1] In India, OSA varied from 4.4% to 13.7% (4.4%–19.7% in males and 2.5%–7.4% in females) in different studies.[2] Prevalence of OSA increases with age particularly in adults >60 years. The increasing rate of obesity also contributes to rise in OSA. Other contributing factors include male sex, anatomical factors, genetic and metabolic disorders, smoking, and postmenopausal female etc.[3] Recent studies have shown that there is a link between bronchial asthma and OSA and there is a bidirectional relationship where each disorder adversely influences the other one.[4] Patients of asthma appear to have an increased risk for OSA than general population. The first study that examines asthma and OSA was a case report by Hudgel and Shucard in 1979.[5] Since then, several studies have shown an increased prevalence of sleep disturbances among asthmatic patients.[67] Epidemiological studies demonstrate that asthma patients more frequently report snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and apnea. A recent population-based prospective epidemiological study showed that asthma is associated with an increased risk of new-onset OSA.[8] In this landmark study, the incidence of OSA over 4 years in patients with self-reported asthma was 27%, compared with 16% without asthma. The relative risk adjusted for risk factors such as body mass index, age, and gender was 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 15%–19%). Despite this well-described association between asthma and OSA, the mechanisms that link the duo still remain hypothetical. Some of the putative pathways that link OSA with asthma include increased parasympathetic tone during apnea, hypoxemia-related reflex bronchoconstriction, irritation of upper airway neural receptors, altered nocturnal neurohormonal secretion, increased inflammatory mediators (both local and systemic), gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity.[9] Corticosteroids may be a potential contributory factor through effect on upper airway caliber (increased adiposity) or dilator muscle function (steroid myopathy) as identified in a study on dose-dependent relationship with inhaled corticosteroids and risk of OSA.[10] Further, it is to be noted that OSA and asthma are often complicated by shared comorbidities and potential for multidirectional casual pathways, i.e., obstruction, inflammation, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, and rhinitis. The coexistence and hypothetical link between cough/asthma, obesity/OSA, rhinosinusitis, and esophageal reflux has also been coined as \"CORE syndrome\" to be specially considered among asthma patients refractory to the therapy.[11] On the other hand, OSA may adversely affect asthma-related outcomes. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that OSA is associated with the poor asthma control, more nocturnal symptoms, and frequent exacerbations in asthma patients.[4] OSA has been found to be associated with specific changes in airway inflammation that is predominantly neutrophilic with high levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, interleukin-8, and low reticular basement membrane thickness in patients with severe asthma, suggesting changes in airway remodeling.[12] Interestingly, patients who are diagnosed with OSA and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) seem to have better asthma control in terms of improved asthma symptoms as well as better morning peak expiratory flow rates and quality of life. It seems that CPAP has beneficial effects on mechanical and neuromechanical properties of lower airways apart from ameliorating gastroesophageal reflux and local as well as systemic inflammation. CPAP also restores sleep and further helps to control asthma.[13] It is, therefore, important to identify this dual, rather complex, association between asthma and OSA. There are more than enough evidences that OSA is not uncommon among asthma patients; however, it is poorly investigated. OSA is largely overlooked in patients having uncontrolled asthma. Patients with poor asthma control despite optimal recommended management need to be screened for possible OSA so as to reduce treatment cost, morbidity, and improved quality of life in such patients. Future research on this \"alternate overlap syndrome\" will further improve our understanding on this topic with some more useful insights for better management strategies.",

      "title": "Gangguan Insomnia pada Mahasiswa Yang Menyusun Skripsi (Studi Kasus pada Mahasiswa Jurusan Psikologi Universitas Negeri Semarang",
      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

      "title": "0653 WORSENING PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE AFTER BRIEF NAPS IN HYPERSOMNOLENT PATIENTS: MSLT NAP CORRELATES",
      "abstract": "Physiologic sleep inertia is operationalized as cognitive impairments upon awakening. Markedly pronounced sleep inertia, or sleep drunkenness, is common in idiopathic hypersomnia and may exist on a continuum with physiologic sleep inertia or may represent a distinct entity. Previous work has demonstrated significant worsening of vigilance on Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses (reaction times >500ms) and reciprocal of reaction time (RRT) following brief naps among hypersomnolent patients, but the MSLT correlates of these changes in vigilance are unknown. Patients undergoing PSG/MSLT (N=118; Age=37.38 ± 14.39; 62.71% women), with diagnoses of Idiopathic hypersomnia (n=37), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (n=29), Narcolepsy Type 1 (n=8) and Type 2 (n=6), and subjective sleepiness with normal MSLT (n=30), were administered PVT before and after MSLT naps 2 and 4. PVT performance was analyzed with paired t-tests, mixed-effects, and general linear models. For nap 2, lapses and RRT demonstrated significant worsening post-nap relative to pre-nap, (10.31 ± 18.56 [pre] vs 13.42 ± 20.65 [post]; t= -2.98, p=0.0035 and 3.24 ± 0.87[pre] vs 3.05 ± 0.91[post]; t=5.06, p= <.0001), respectively. Similar results were seen for nap 4 for lapses (t=-3.35, p=0.0011) and RRT (t=3.24, p=0.0016). Sleep duration on nap 2 was significantly associated with increased lapses (B=.80, S.E.=0.22, p=0.001) and worsened RRT (B=.03, S.E.=0.01, p=0.001) post-nap, but not on nap 4. Sleep efficiency on nap 2 was significantly associated with increased lapses (B=-8.57, S.E.=3.96, p=0.032) and worsened RRT (B=.38, S.E.=.14, p=0.006), but not on nap 4. Nocturnal PSG variables (sleep time, sleep efficiency, %N3 sleep, %REM sleep) and PSG/MSLT-based diagnoses were unrelated to PVT change in performance. Despite the generally short amount of accrued sleep time, psychomotor vigilance worsens immediately upon awakening from a morning MSLT nap in hypersomnolent patients, and this worsening is strongly related to amount of sleep obtained/sleep efficiency. This finding has implications for napping recommendations among those with excessive daytime sleepiness.",

The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked. The nocturnal disturbances are usually of more concern to the bed partner who may incur injuries from violent dream enactment.",

      "title": "Age Related Changes in Sleep and Circadian Physiology: From Brain Mechanisms to Sleep Behavior",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep and circadian physiology change in healthy older adults independent of medical conditions or medications (1-3). In general, deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is reduced, there are more awakenings from sleep, and the time spent awake in bed trying to sleep is increased. Such sleep disruptions are exacerbated by age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (4), cancer (5,6), nocturia (7), pain (4,8), diabetes (8,9), and depression (10,11). It is estimated that 40% to 70% of older adults experience chronic sleep problems, and that about 50% of the cases are untreated by primary care physicians (12). Sleep problems are even more common in geriatric patients with dementia (13,14). Aging with and without associated medical problems is also associated with changes in the physiology of the internal circadian timekeeping system that regulates near-24-hour rhythms in human physiology and behavior; and age-related changes in circadian physiology are thought to contribute to sleep problems (14-17). This chapter will first review sleep-wakefulness and circadian neurophysiology. Knowledge of the brain regions involved in promoting sleep and wakefulness states can provide perspective on how medications commonly used in the geriatric patient can affect daytime and nighttime function. This discussion will be followed by a review of how sleep and circadian brain regulatory systems change with aging. Knowledge of age-related changes in sleep and circadian systems may promote a better understanding of potential mechanisms underlying sleep problems in the geriatric patient and may help to inform the development of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment strategies.",

However, it remains unknown whether sleep terrors occur only from NREM sleep. We evaluated 3 cases of a sleep terrors-like parasomnia that occurred exclusively during arousals from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These parasomnia events occurred at REM sleep-wake transitions, manifesting with screaming or crying, similar to sleep terrors, without alertness or clear orientation. The patients were all young-adult females without notable medical conditions. REM sleep behavior disorder and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy were not detected based on their video-polysomnographic findings. These 3 cases should be provisionally diagnosed as \"Parasomnia, Unspecified\" according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition; however, the phenomenological diagnosis is proposed to be \"Disorders of Arousal from REM Sleep.\" Our reported cases indicate that sleep terrors may also arise from REM sleep.Futenma K, Inoue Y, Saso A, Takaesu Y, Yamashiro Y, Matsuura M.

      "abstract": "Abstract Tremors in post‐traumatic stress disorders have not been previously well characterized. A 67‐year‐old man has a 46‐year history of a noiseinduced exaggerated startle reflex followed by a large amplitude rest, postural and kinetic tremor that may persist for up to 3 days. This tremor is superimposed on a continuous mild organic postural/kinetic tremor whose electrophysiological characteristics are different from those of the overlying tremor. We attribute the exaggerated startle reflex and the noise‐induced tremor to Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and postulate a psychogenic origin for the noise‐induced tremor. The patient alos believes the noise‐induced tremor to be psychologically based and to be produced by the fear and anxiety he experiences when he hears loud, unexpected noises. The sudden onset of the noise‐induced tremor, its intermittent character, its temporary disappearance on distraction despite the patient's inability to suppress it, inconsistencies in handwriting and figure drawing, and the fact that the noise‐induced tremor is stimulus specific and persists long after the offending stimulus (noise) is no longer present all suggest a tremor of psychogenic origin.",

We report on their detailed clinical courses and extensive follow-up examinations.Incidence is estimated at four cases per million population per year. Nonspecific prodromal symptoms (headache, dizziness) frequently (80%) precede livedo racemosa for 3.5 and (multi)focal neurological symptoms of fully developed disease for 9 years followed by progressive cognitive impairment (60%) 10 years later. Involvement of fundi, peripheral nerves, heart, and kidneys is frequent (50% to 70%) yet usually asymptomatic. Some symptoms prove irreversible (livedo racemosa, multifocal cerebral lesions on imaging, or creatinine clearance), whereas other symptoms tend to resolve after days to years (many focal neurological symptoms, some electrocardiographic changes, or hypertension). Mortality is calculated at 9.5% within an average observation time of 6.2 years. Laboratory findings, including antiphospholipid antibodies, are normal except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates and complement consumption at times of disease progression and increased cholesterol levels parallel to disease extent. Skin biopsy specimens reveal inflammatory findings (\"endothelitis\") of small- to medium-sized arteries followed by subendothelial proliferation and fibrosis. Hypertension is the only risk factor significantly associated with a more severe course of the disease; no medication proved effective.Sneddon's syndrome is an often unrecognized, slowly progressive, systemic disease with evidence of vasculitic origin.",

      "title": "IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP BLOOD PRESSURE",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Blood pressure varies throughout the day and night and is maintained at different times by different control systems. During the awake interval, the sympathetic nervous system is preeminent but during sleep the renin angiotensin system is the controller. Sleep blood pressure is a more powerful predictor of non‐haemorrhagic cerebro‐ and cardiovascular events in animals and humans, despite the sleep value being lower than the day value. Drugs that act independently of the hormonal or neural systems, such as diuretics and calcium channel blockers, have similar effects during sleep and awake intervals. Beta‐blockers have little effect during sleep when the activity of the sympathetic is low while drugs that interfere with the action of the renin angiotensin system have a greater blood pressure lowering effect during sleep. One aim of therapy should be to ensure that blood pressure is low during sleep and drugs should be used in doses that lower blood pressure throughout the 24 h period.",

      "title": "Sleep-disordered breathing: in depression and schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are becoming more prevalent. There is an overlap of symptoms related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and many psychiatric conditions. Complaints of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, and depressive symptoms can be related to both disease states. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by repetitive disruption of sleep by cessation of breathing and was first described in the 19th century by bedside observation during sleep. Physicians observed this cessation of breathing while the patient slept and postulated that these episodes were responsible for subsequent complaints of sleepiness. OSAS can coexist with major depressive disorder, exacerbate depressive symptoms, or be responsible for a large part of the symptom complex of depression. Additionally, in schizophrenia, sleep apnea may develop as a result of chronic neuroleptic treatment and its effect on gains in body weight, a major risk factor for the development of OSAS.It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Recognition of the existence of sleep apnea, prompt referral to a sleep specialist, and ultimately treatment of an underlying sleep disorder, such as OSAS, can ameliorate symptoms of psychiatric disease.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology and treatment of enuresis: Focus on sleep",
      "abstract": "Currently, nocturnal polyuria as a result of desmopressin deficiency, nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal threshold is considered to be central to the pathogenesis of enuresis.1 The sleep of enuretic children might be deep, but possibly disturbed (by obstructed airways or by a distended or contracting bladder). Because both detrusor contractions and bladder distension are recognized as strong arousal stimuli,2 many investigators have speculated that there must be something amiss with the enuretic children's arousal mechanisms.1 A striking report came from Yeung et al., who demonstrated, using polysomnography and continuous cystometry, that the signals from an overactive bladder cause increased arousal during sleep, and that the sleep of enuretic children might in fact be disturbed by frequent, inefficient arousal reactions (an interaction between bladder overactivity and cortical arousability: a “bladder–brain dialogue”).3 They suggested that the transition from light sleep to awakening was suppressed by long-term overstimulation by signals from the bladder to the brain. Further studies had not been reported until Dhondt et al. found, using video-polysomnography, concomitant increased sleep fragmentation and abnormally increased “periodic limb movements” during sleep in treatment-resistant enuresis.4 In this issue of the Journal, Tsuji et al. report lower sleep efficiency assessed using a novel contactless biomotion sensor in enuretic children, and that this remained unchanged after successful treatment with enuresis alarm,5 although we might take into consideration the possibility that the Tsuji et al. patients were not polyuric at night-time (because those patients were treated with alarm, not by desmopressin). Recently, the Japanese Society on Enuresis issued clinical guidelines in which they proposed first-line therapy for monosymptomatic enuresis consisting of desmopressin and enuresis alarm,6 in accordance with the recommendation from the International Children's Continence Society.7 Desmopressin diminishes nocturnal polyuria, and the alarm can be presumed to act on sleep and arousal, but whether this occurs through some form of conditioning or resetting of the arousal thresholds is unclear.1 Nearly 15–20% of patients do not respond to the first-line therapy, and additional treatment involving anticholinergics or antidepressants is proposed for them. Anticholinergics can decrease detrusor overactivity, whereas antidepressants presumably have multiple noradrenergic and serotoninergic effects, acting on the central nervous system and/or the bladder.1 Still some enuretic patients are refractory to this second- or third-line treatment. Several preliminary anti-enuretic results have been reported recently for the following medications, which modulate the sleep condition of enuretic patients: melatonin,8-10 clonidine,11 and yokukansan.12 To clarify the mechanisms by which these drugs have a beneficial effect on enuresis, additional studies on patient sleep states using up-to-date methods, including the one reported by Tsuji et al.,5 are necessary. The author declares no conflict of interest. Y.O. designed and wrote the editorial.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia remitting after maxillomandibular advancement for mild obstructive sleep apnea: a case series",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are both common sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia is thought to result from stress-related physiologic hyperarousal (somatic arousal) that makes it difficult for an individual to fall or stay asleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is thought to result from obstructive respiratory events causing arousals, sleep fragmentation, and recurrent oxygen desaturation. Although the two disorders seem different, they predispose to the same long-term, stress-related illnesses, and when they occur in the same individual, each affects the other's response to treatment; they interact. This report of three cases describes patients with both chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea in whom the chronic insomnia remitted with no specific treatment following treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with maxillomandibular advancement.Our three Caucasians patients each presented with severe, chronic insomnia associated with somatic arousal and fatigue occurring either alone, in association with bipolar disorder, or with temporomandibular joint syndrome. Polysomnography revealed that each patient also had mild obstructive sleep apnea, despite only one snoring audibly. One patient experienced a modest improvement in her somatic arousal, insomnia severity, and fatigue with autotitrating nasal continuous positive airway pressure, but the other two did not tolerate nasal continuous positive airway pressure. None of the patients received treatment for insomnia. All three patients subsequently underwent maxillomandibular advancement to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea and experienced prolonged, complete resolution of somatic arousal, chronic insomnia, and fatigue. The patient with bipolar disorder also experienced complete remission of his symptoms of depression during the 1 year he was followed postoperatively.These three cases lend support to the hypothesis that chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea share a pathophysiology of chronic stress. Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the stress response is directed at inspiratory airflow limitation during sleep (hypopnea, snoring, and inaudible fluttering of the throat). Therefore, when chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea occur in one individual, aggressive treatment of obstructive sleep apnea may lead to a reduction in chronic stress that causes the patient's chronic insomnia to remit.",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "The impact of stress on sleep: Pathogenic sleep reactivity as a vulnerability to insomnia and circadian disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep reactivity is the trait-like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.",

      "title": "The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin.

Sleep efficiency and the amount of time spent in deep sleep appear to be reduced in many Sjögren’s patients. The causes of sleep problems in Sjögren’s are unknown, but autonomic nervous system involvement is suspected of playing a role. Major factors associated with Sjögren’s and sleep disturbances were dry eye, sleep apnea, and nocturnal pain. While few studies have been done, medications under investigation for use in Sjögren’s and other autoimmune disorders or already on the market for sleep problems might prove useful.",

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

Attacks can be precipitated or made worse by cold, rest after exercise, anesthesia, potassium loading, hunger, emotional stress, pregnancy and glucocorticoids (2). Sleep has not been well described as one of the triggers for paralysis. HPP can be confused with sleep paralysis and in some cases with cataplexy. Many patients go undiagnosed for decades. Neurology and sleep literature is lacking in sleep associated periodic paralysis.\n DESIGN/METHODS: Case report\n RESULTS: \nRS is a 61 year old woman with life long sleep onset associated paralysis which has resulted in chronic insomnia and fear of falling asleep. Her paralysis can also be precipitated by eating salted peanuts. She comes from a large family where many members suffer from the same condition (maternal grandmother, mother, sister, two brothers, and daughter) and only one of her brothers has been formally diagnosed. She was referred to sleep medicine clinic to evaluate for “narcolepsy variant” and was diagnosed there with HPP. Genetic testing is pending.\n CONCLUSIONS: \nHPP has varied presentations and should be considered in patients with sleep onset paralysis thus preventing prolonged time to appropriate diagnosis and treatment which can last for decades.\n Study Supported by: Disclosure: Dr. Gorfinkel Pyatkevich has nothing to disclose.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Patients presented to the author after an episode of confusion, amnesia, or somnambulism. Legal defendants were being prosecuted for driving under the influence, and the author reviewed the cases as expert witness for the defense. Potential predisposing factors including comorbidities, social situation, physician instruction, concomitant medications, and patterns of medication management were considered.Patients and defendants exhibited abnormal behavior characterized by poor motor control and confusion. Although remaining apparently interactive with the environment, all reported amnesia for 3 to 5 hours. In some cases, the episodes began during daytime wakefulness because of accidental or purposeful ingestion of the zolpidem and are considered automatisms. Other cases began after ingestion of zolpidem at the time of going to bed and are considered parasomnias. Risk factors for both wake and sleep-related automatic complex behaviors include the concomitant ingestion of other sedating drugs, a higher dose of zolpidem, a history of parasomnia, ingestion at times other than bedtime or when sleep is unlikely, poor management of pill bottles, and living alone. In addition, similar size and shape of two medications contributed to accidental ingestion in at least one case.Sleep driving and other complex behaviors can occur after zolpidem ingestion. Physicians should assess patients for potential risk factors and inquire about parasomnias. Serious legal and medical complications can occur as a result of these forms of automatic complex behaviors.",

Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia may arise during the acute phase of illness and persists in many cases in chronic phase.The authors intend to review the main sleep disturbances observed in schizophrenia, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, their clinical impact, and the effects of antipsychotic medication on sleep architecture.This study was carried out a systematic search of published literature from January 1965 to May 2010, through PubMed, using the following key words: sleep, REM sleep, NREM sleep, schizophrenia, polysomnography, actigraphy and antipsychotics.Most changes found in objective studies using the polysomnography, in patients with schizophrenia are: reduction of total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, REM latency and sleep efficiency. Studies using actigraphy also reveal that these patients experience changes in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, specifically the irregular type and phase advance. Although some sleep disorders improve with antipsychotic treatment, in many cases, even during the remission of the disease, sleep continues fragmented , suggesting that there are physiopathologic mechanisms involved in sleep disturbance in these patients.Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on rehabilitation strategies, quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, and may contribute to worsening of cognitive deficits.",

Brainstem disorders of subacute onset (onset and progression with accumulation of disabling deficits in 6–12 weeks) are generally of autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative neoplastic cause. An autoimmune or infectious brainstem disorder may be referred to as brainstem encephalitis or rhombencephalitis. We describe a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune rhombencephalitis, in whom diagnostic clues included the following: diverse visual and sleep symptoms, trismus, and choking in the history; see-saw nystagmus, opsoclonus, dysarthria, jaw dystonia, and episodic laryngospasm on examination; subtle but longitudinal and nonenhancing T2 MRI abnormalities in the brainstem and upper cervical cord; and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. His movement disorder–specific neural IgG profile revealed ANNA-2 (anti-Ri) and KLHL-11-IgG. Both are biomarkers of paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis. KLCHL-11-IgG has been reported to accompany germ cell tumors, which was found in a solitary metastasis to the left inguinal lymph node in our patient, along with an atrophic left testis. Multidisciplinary treatment (autoimmune neurology, sleep medicine, ophthalmology, and physiatry) led to significant clinical improvements. This case provides a framework for the evaluation of patients with subacute-onset brainstem syndromes and the investigation and management of those with paraneoplastic and other autoimmune diseases.",

The symptoms and manifestations that characterize sleepwalking show great variations both within and across predisposed patients. Sleepwalking is more common in childhood than in adulthood, as most children will experience, at least temporarily, one or more of the NREM sleep parasomnias during childhood or early adolescence. Sleep laboratory investigations have yielded considerable information on the polysomnographic characteristics of sleepwalkers. There is a strong genetic component to somnambulism. About 80% of somnambulistic patients have at least one family member affected by this parasomnia, and the prevalence of somnambulism is higher in children of parents with a history of sleepwalking. In addition to the atypical sleep parameters and genetic component reviewed, other factors have been proposed, including psychopathology and deregulation of serotonergic systems. Hypnosis (including self-hypnosis) has been found to be effective in both children and adults presenting with chronic sleepwalking.",

It chronically affects 2% of the French population, is more frequent in women, peaks at middle age and has a remittent/ progressive evolution. Secondary causes include use of antidepressants, neuroleptics, low levels (< 50 ng/ml) of serum ferritin, polyneuritis and rhumatoid polyarthritis. The mechanisms of idiopathic RLS – probably genetic – may involve a deficit in brain iron storage, that leads to dopaminergic central dysfonction. RLS are exquisitely sensitive to low evening dose of dopamine agonists. Painful or resistant forms may benefit from association with anticonvulsivants, iron or opiates.",

This can occur in cases of hanging. Some degree of permanent cerebral damage is inevitable if hypoxic-ischaemia lasts beyond 3–5 minutes. Here we present a case report in which even though the patient was hanged for more than five minutes until the formation of a ligature mark and exhibited cyanosis, unconsciousness and seizures, the outcome was favourable with prompt and early intervention. Recovery was complete such that there were no residual signs and symptoms of reduced brain perfusion.",

One of the most important factors is neurotic depression. The most prominent symptom of neurotic depression is sleep disturbance, especially waking up many times at night. When you diagnose a vertigo patient as having neurotic depression, I recommend prescribing the antidepressant amitriptyline (10 mg at night). If this is not effective, you may use a dose of 20 mg to 75 mg. The case of symptoms such as vertigo or general fatigue, you may prescribe maprotiline (10 mg after breakfast); if this not effective, increase the dose to 30 mg every morning, afternoon, and night. If the case is especially severe, change maprotiline to dosulepin (75 mg). In the most severe cases try lofepramine (30 mg to 90 mg).If the patients are not in a depressive state, or take an overdose of the antidepressant, they often have nightmares or have resting tremors in their hands. When you observe such symptoms, stop the antidepressant therapy immediately.",

The adverse effects of poor sleep in this population can include reduced memory, impaired concentration, inhibited functional performance, decreased quality of life, chronic fatigue and increased risk of cognitive decline, malaise, accidents, falls and mortality. As such, the appropriate assessment and treatment of sleep disorders, particularly in older populations, are vital. Carefully considered sleep diaries and histories are essential diagnostic tools; comorbid problems such as pain or depression and current medications should be considered as possible causes. Non-pharmacological interventions such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioural treatments should be considered first. Short half-life medications such as zolpidem and zaleplon may be considered for short-term treatment.",

ETHIOLOGY It considered to be a result of static structural developing brain damage. CLINICAL PICTURE Variable seizures develop mostly within the first 10 days of life, but may occur during the first hour after delivery. The most frequently observed seizure type are epileptic spasms, which may be either generalized and symmetrical or lateralized. The tonic spasms may occur in clusters or singly, while awake and during sleep alike. The duration of spasms is up to 10 seconds, and the interval between spasms within cluster ranges from 9 to 15 seconds. In one third of cases, other seizure types include partial motor seizures or hemiconvulsions The disorder takes a progressively deteriorating course with increasing frequency of seizures and severe retardation of psychomotor development. DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP In the initial stage of Ohtahara syndrome, interictal EEG shows a pattern of suppression-burst with high-voltage paroxysmal discharges separated by prolonged periods of nearly flat tracing that last for up to 18 seconds. PROGNOSIS AND THREATMENT Half of the reported children having Ohtahara syndrome die in infancy. Anticonvulsant helps little in controlling the seizures and halting the deterioration of psychomotor development. Severe psychomotor retardation is the rule. With time, the disorder may evolve into West syndrome or partial epilepsy. Psychomotor development may be slightly better if the infants do not develop West and later Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.",

We report 10 patients with persistent neurologic deficits or death after well-documented NCSE in the form of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients). NCSE in the form of CPSE is not a benign entity. Serious morbidity and mortality may occur due to the adverse effects of prolonged seizures and as a result of acute brain disorders that precipitate the seizures.",

Here we addressed this issue in a proof-of-principle study of 67 patients representing major syndromes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), in relation to 25 healthy older individuals. We collected reports on clinically-relevant sleep characteristics - time spent overnight in bed, sleep quality, excessive daytime somnolence and disruptive sleep events. Difficulty falling or staying asleep at night and excessive daytime somnolence were significantly more frequently reported for patients with both FTD and AD than healthy controls. On average, patients with FTD and AD retired earlier and patients with AD spent significantly longer in bed overnight than did healthy controls. Excessive daytime somnolence was significantly more frequent in the FTD group than the AD group; AD syndromic subgroups showed similar sleep symptom profiles while FTD subgroups showed more variable profiles. Sleep disturbance is a significant clinical issue in major FTD and AD variant syndromes and may be even more salient in FTD than AD. These preliminary findings warrant further systematic investigation with electrophysiological and neuroanatomical correlation in major proteinopathies.",

Although the mechanism is unknown, some cases are secondary to hot flushes during the menopausal period, medical, mental and sleep disorders, and medication, while dysregulation of thermoregulation during sleep is suspected in primary cases. We present the case of a woman with severe primary sleep hyperhidrosis, occurring nightly for 23 years, which definitively resolved after brief treatment with oxybutynin (a muscarinic receptor-blocking anticholinergic). An ammoniacal odor in the sweat and a sensation of coldness on awakening during sweating episodes suggest that the mechanism of her night sweating was not an exacerbation of thermoregulation during the night but shares the mechanical properties of emotional/psychological sweating. This extreme case of sleep hyperhidrosis was treated with excellent efficacy and minimal side effects using oxybutynin, which could benefit other patients with nighttime discomfort.",

Physical activity and sleep exhibit positive synergy, whereby each optimizes quality of and capability for the other. Our sedentary, sleep-restricted lifestyle conflicts with our genotype to generate pathophysiologic phenotypes, especially obesity. Insufficient sleep is pandemic, and other sleep disorders are increasingly common. Sleep dysfunction promotes obesity due to inactivity from sleepiness and to metabolic changes. Obesity is the primary risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, which commonly disrupts sleep. This represents one of many pathophysiologic vicious cycles involving inactivity, sleep disorders, and obesity. Solutions include better education of the medical community, which remains surprisingly ignorant about these disease processes and therapeutic advantages of exercise and sleep repletion. Doctors commonly prescribe medications with sleep disruption or weight-gain side effects instead of lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle improvements often provide superior treatment to medications and impose no side effects.",

A technique of nitrous oxide administration beyond the state of intoxication and avoiding the Stage of deep hypoxemia has been described. 3. Physiological changes with this form of anæsthesia are slight and the method may be considered safe. 4. After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cognitive dysfunction - mainly of secondary memory, executive, and constructional abilities - is a marker of disease severity with important clinical and prognostic implications. It correlates with poor compliance with pharmacological therapy, and poor compliance, in turn, increases the cost/effectiveness ratio of home care programs. Executive dysfunction is associated with difficulty with inhaler devices and should be systematically evaluated before prescribing. Drawing impairment has been associated with mortality, although the underlying neurologic abnormalities (right insular damage with autonomic dysfunction or subcortical damage) remain to be defined. Depression is also negatively correlated with survival, besides being a risk factor for quitting respiratory rehabilitation. Cognitive dysfunction should always be considered among the systemic effects of COPD and be the object of systematic screening in COPD patients. Identifying cognitive impairment would prompt either interventions promoting the adherence to the therapy or further investigations to exclude respiratory (nocturnal or effort hypoxemia, coexistent obstructive sleep apnoea) or non respiratory (decompensated diabetes, hypoglycaemic crises, poorly controlled hypertension etc.) causes of cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive enhancing strategies deserve consideration in the framework of a comprehensive approach aimed at improving the health status of people with COPD.

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

      "abstract": "There are two kinds of flashbacks: the self-programed or intra-individual variety and pre-programed or inter-individual flashbacks re-presenting mythical and narrative event structures which contribute to the survival of the species. Both types of experiences are arousal-state bound and stage (set and setting) or culture bound. Flashbackers may be characterized by (1) their variability (large SD) on perceptual-behavioural tasks pointing to their extensive cognitive or interpretive repertoire, (2) they are minimizers (or reducers) of sensory input (particularly at the peak of a hallucinogenic drug experience), (3) as a group they display high resting heart rates, (4) are hypnotizable and experience), (3) as group they display high resting heart rates, (4) are hypnotizable and hence (5) prefer righ cerebral hemispheric cognition, (6) displaying EEG-alpha dominance in the resting, waking state. Flashback and hypnotic recall differ only in the ways and means by which they are induced. Hypnotic induction, however, is not to be confused with the induced state that may be any ordinary or non-ordinary state of consciousness on the perception-hallucination-meditation continuum which the subject has a least once experienced before. If mind is an open system comprising the individual's mind and the minds of his total environment, i.e. his past and present sets and settings, then for many of us thoughts and actions are hypnotically induced, and memories are flashbacks of those experiences.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical problem that can have serious health consequences and complicate the course of mental disorders. It is estimated that the prevalence of sleep apnea in patients with bipolar disorder can be 21-47.5%. Some symptoms of OSA are the same as the symptoms of depression: daytime drowsiness, cognitive dysfunction, decreased drive, apathy, depressed mood, anhedonia.We present a case of a patient whose depressive symptoms persisted despite repeated changes of pharmacological treatment and were exacerbated by severe sleep disorder. OSA was also the cause of serious respiratory complications and prolonged disorders of consciousness that occurred during ECT treatment.Based on test results of WatchPAT200 and polysomnography, the diagnosis of severe sleep apnea was established and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment was introduced. Severe OSA led in this patient to almost total absence of REM sleep, a significant reduction of deep sleep as well as the reduction of total sleep time.The presence of daytime sleepiness, unremitting despite the modification of treatment, indicates the need for diagnostic screening for OSA, which can mimic some of the symptoms of depression, increase the risk of complications during anesthesia, and can be one of the causes of drug resistance. In addition to the negative impact of obstructive sleep apnea on the course of bipolar disorder, OSA also causes significant cognitive impairment in terms of attention and vigilance, long-term semantic and visual memory as well as visual-spatial and executive functions.",

      "abstract": "Die postpartalen psychischen Störungen lassen sich im Wesentlichen drei Gruppen zuordnen: Dem so genannten \"Baby Blues\", der Wochenbettdepression und der Wochenbettpsychose. Der etwa 3 - 5 Tage nach Entbindung auftretende Baby Blues kommt nach 50 - 70 % aller Geburten vor und klingt nach etwa einer Woche ohne weitere Therapie meist folgenlos ab. Allerdings entwickeln 20 - 30 % dieser Frauen im weiteren Wochenbettverlauf eine Depression, weshalb bei über 2 Wochen post partum persistierenden Bluessymptomen eine genauere Exploration hinsichtlich einer Depression zu empfehlen ist. Wochenbettdepressionen betreffen 10 - 15 % aller Entbundenen; sie treten meist mehrere Wochen bis Monate nach Entbindung in Form einer depressiven Verstimmung mit Schlafstörungen, Ängstlichkeit, Antriebsmangel, Interessenverlust und Schuldgefühlen bis hin zu Selbstmordgedanken auf. Um sie nicht als Babyblues fehlzudeuten, sind gezielte Fragen nach der Stimmungslage der jungen Mutter bei der Untersuchung 6 Wochen post partum, ggfs. unter Anwendung der Edinburgh-Skala zu empfehlen. Patientinnen mit bekannten Risikofaktoren für die Entwicklung einer Wochenbettdepression (Z.n. Wochenbettdepression oder Wochenbettpsychose, depressive Erkrankung, Angsterkrankung, bipolare Erkrankung) bedürfen einer engmaschigen Überwachung und ggfs. einer prophylaktischen Behandlung in Kooperation mit dem Psychiater. Leichtere Formen der Wochenbettdepression sind ambulant mit psychotherapeutischen und soziotherapeutischen Maßnahmen meist gut zu behandeln. Bei schwereren Verläufen sind Antidepressiva (selektive Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) oder bestimmte Trizyklika) indiziert. Postpartale Angst- und Zwangsstörungen sprechen gut auf Psychotherapie an; bei Angsterkrankungen werden außerdem Benzodiazepine, bei Zwangserkrankungen SSRI empfohlen. Wochenbettpsychosen (ca. 0,1 - 0,2 %) treten vermehrt bei bekannter bipolarer oder schizoaffektiver Störung bzw. bei Z.n. Wochenbettpsychose auf. Sie müssen vor allem wegen der Gefahr des erweiterten Suizids stationär behandelt werden; idealerweise erfolgt dies in interdisziplinären Mutter-Kind-Einheiten.",

Tal es el caso de la aparicion de periodos de somnolencia durante las jornadas laborales, lo cual se ha convertido en una causa importante de accidentes automovilisticos, industriales y medicos. La somnolencia es causada por el ritmo circadiano y la privacion del sueno, es un estado fisiologico donde el tiempo de respuesta es mas lento que los niveles normales, los principales sintomas de somnolencia son la falta de capacidad de concentracion, atencion, vigilancia y dificultades para mantenerse despierto (Abbood, et al., 2014). En esta tesis se presenta el desarrollo de un sistema de asistencia no intrusivo para la deteccion de somnolencia en tiempo real, que alerta al usuario si es necesario, con el objetivo de reducir el numero de accidentes causados por somnolencia. El dispositivo desarrollado esta basado en el monitoreo de ritmo cardiaco debido a que el sistema nervioso autonomo afecta el latido del corazon de una persona con somnolencia (Bader, 2002). En este proyecto se realizaron estudios aplicando la metodologia seis sigma para el desarrollo de productos, basandose en una muestra de 20 usuarios, monitoreando su ritmo cardiaco a lo largo de sus actividades diarias para determinar sus rangos de vigilia y sueno, posteriormente se realizaron pruebas con un simulador de manejo activando un sistema de asistencia cuando su estado de alerta disminuia drasticamente. Como sistema de asistencia se incorporo una alarma sonora para recuperar el estado de alerta del usuario, debido a los efectos del sonido en las primeras etapas del sueno. Se identificaron variaciones importantes en el ritmo cardiaco que pueden ser utilizadas para la estandarizacion del monitoreo de somnolencia, manteniendo la medicion del estado de alerta, sin importar los rangos de ritmo cardiaco de cada persona.",

      "title": "0670 REDUCED CENTROPARIETAL SLOW WAVE ACTIVITY DURING NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN HYPERSOMNOLENCE DISORDER: A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC HIGH-DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Hypersomnolence disorder is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep duration of idiopathic origin. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is frequently associated with hypersomnolence, but it is unclear whether hypersomnolence disorder and hypersomnolence associated with mood disorders are distinct entities, or if they share a common neurobiology. Thus, this study utilized ad libitum high-density (hd) EEG polysomnographic recordings to examine differences in sleep duration and continuity, as well as topographic alterations in SWA, which has been associated with the restorative aspects of sleep, in patients with and without hypersomnolence disorder, as well as with and without MDD, to clarify whether hypersomnolence is associated with transdiagnostic alterations in neurophysiological function. Eighty-three persons underwent 256-channel hdEEG polysomnography without prescribed wake time. Patients with MDD with (HYP+/MDD+) and without (HYP-/MDD+) comorbid hypersomnolence (n=22 each group), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; n=22) were recruited from a prospective study of hypersomnolence in mood disorders. Seventeen patients with hypersomnolence disorder without MDD (HYP+/MDD-) were drawn from a clinical sample. Clinical and sleep architecture variables were compared between groups. Topographic patterns of SWA relative to controls were also compared among disordered groups, and correlations between regional alterations in SWA and measures of sleepiness assessed. HYP+/MDD+ and HYP+/MDD- groups had similar sleep efficiency, stage distribution, and subjective sleepiness, and demonstrated similarly increased total sleep time relative to both HC and HYP-/MDD+ groups. HYP+/MDD+ and HYP+/MDD- also demonstrated reduced bilateral centroparietal SWA relative to HC, which was not observed for HYP-/MDD+ relative to HC. Slow wave activity in these regions also significantly negatively correlated with subjective measures of hypersomnolence. Reduced bilateral centroparietal SWA may be a transdiagnostic neurophysiologic finding in patients with unexplained hypersomnolence. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms through which these cortical changes are related to clinical complaints of daytime sleepiness. This research was supported by grants from the American Sleep Medicine Foundation, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, and NIMH (K23MH099234).",

La ansiedad es la segunda entidad con mayor frecuencia, quizás debido a la liberación de catecolaminas durante la noche. Existen otras sintomatologías asociadas a la apnea del sueño que deben ser revisadas y que mejorarían con un tratamiento adecuado, así como también mejoraría la calidad de vida de los pacientes, pues la atención, la concentración y la memoria incrementarían o disminuirían la irritabilidad y otros síntomas.",

Women have a higher incidence than men of insomnia and are more likely than men to complain of insomnia, headache, irritability, and fatigue than the ‘‘typical’’ symptoms of loud snoring and apneas during sleep. Reproductive hormones play an important role in sleep in women. In the premenopausal age these hormones have a protective effect on sleep apnea while on pregnancy there is a higher prevalence of sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. Cardiovascular mortality is high in women with obstructive sleep apnea and continuous positive airway pressure therapy improves outcomes in most cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and therapies for the three most common sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome), along with effects of menopause, pregnancy, and social factors on sleep in women, are key considerations for clinicians caring for female patients across the adult life span.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "title": "Therapeutics for the Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

However, the most common symptom of schizophrenia is disability in everyday functioning: impairments in social, living, and vocational outcomes. The striking clinical signs of schizophrenia are episodic in nature and can come and go even in the absence of treatment, as demonstrated by the fact that up to a third of people with schizophrenia demonstrated remission of these symptoms even prior to the development of antipsychotic medications. In contrast, disability in schizophrenia develops early in the illness and is persistent, even during periods when the symptoms just described are absent because of treatment or spontaneous remission.",

In some cases, dream-like mentation is found also in non-REM parasomnia.We report a case of complex and dramatic sleepwalking behavior in a 26-year-old adult male who tied his 4-month-old daughter to the clothesline in the attic of his house.The explanation of this seemingly senseless behavior, which was related to psychosocial stressors, was found in a detailed dream-like mentation that was reported by the patient. At the same time, an organic factor, namely, a worsening of the patient's asthma, was identified as the cause of an increased fragmentation of sleep.In some cases of non-REM parasomnia, detailed dream-like mentation may act as a bridge between psychosocial stressors and the specific parasomnic behavior.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

The incidence of the different causes of syncope changes with age. In older patients, reflex syncope, cardiac syncope, and carotid sinus syndrome become increasingly frequent. The usual image of a syncopal attack is of a subject feeling dizzy, going pale, falling with loss of awareness, and then recovering rapidly within about 30 seconds. Training in breath control and anxiety management by physiotherapists and/or clinical psychologists is indicated when the attacks are troublesome. Psychogenic non-epileptic attacks present for the first time most frequently in teenage or young adult females, but there is increasing recognition that they also present in elderly patients. Episodic events during sleep can be due to normal physiological phenomena and sleep disorders as well as partial or generalised epileptic seizures. Periodic movements become increasingly frequent with age and are very common in the elderly.",

      "title": "0863 A Unique case of sleep state misperception in an elderly patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Insomnia is a widespread condition, especially in the elderly population. While the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) third edition appropriately removed primary insomnia subtypes from the classification, our case illustrates the importance of these factors in considering a chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis. We present a case of severe subjective insomnia with no apparent objective findings, instead with evidence of excellent sleep efficiency on the contrary. Report of Cases: A 76-year-old male with a past medical history of anxiety and a recent diagnosis of early Parkinson's disease presented to the Sleep medicine clinic with two years of insomnia which started after his retirement. The patient felt difficulty with falling asleep every night. He underwent a sleep study and was found to have sleep-disordered breathing, which responded well to Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy. However, insomnia symptoms persisted and were resistant to multiple medications, including Mirtazapine, Melatonin, and Suvorexant. He was referred for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with minimal to no improvement in his symptoms. Conversely, a one-week Actigraphy recording on Bipap therapy surprisingly revealed an excellent sleep efficiency with near-continuous seven to eight hours of sleep every night. The etiology of chronic insomnia is poorly understood but is typically multifactorial, as described in the second edition of ICSD. In this case, paradoxical insomnia played a significant role in the patient's clinical presentation. Paradoxical insomnia is defined as thoughts or perceptions of time asleep as wakefulness, with objective measures documenting normative amounts of sleep. Previous work suggests that alterations in the sleep/arousal system may contribute to this apparent mismatch between conventional objective sleep measures and subjective reports. Conclusion This case demonstrates the challenge of effectively diagnosing and managing chronic insomnia. While the new classification guidelines from the ICSD appropriately remove insomnia subtypes from the diagnostic paradigm, familiarity with these previously described subtypes may aid clinical decisions. Crucial to this discussion is that previously described \"secondary\" or \"subtypes\" of primary insomnia may develop an independent clinical course that may require further attention.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) is used for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. It can alter breathing patterns leading to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Screening for SDB is recommended before and after initiation of VNS therapy. We present a case of VNS-induced SDB which responded to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Report of case(s) A 40-year-old Caucasian female underwent a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) due to symptoms of snoring, difficulty initiating sleep, teeth grinding, vivid dreams, nightmares, excessive daytime fatigue, and sleepiness. She denied parasomnia, symptoms of narcolepsy, and restless leg syndrome. Her habitual sleep duration was 9 hours with a sleep latency of 1 hour. She had 2-3 nighttime awakenings without nocturia. Pertinent medical history included refractory focal epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, insomnia, and attention deficit disorder. Medications were eslicarbazepine 800 mg daily, topiramate 200 mg twice daily, lamotrigine 100 mg daily, trazodone 300 mg nightly, and Adderall 60 mg daily. She had a VNS implanted 5 years ago. VNS settings were frequency of 20 Hz with on and off time of 30 and 60 seconds respectively. Her body mass index was 21 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 15. HSAT showed significant periodic breathing without Cheyne stokes respiration and a 4% apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 9.6/hour. Follow-up diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG) revealed periodic breathing with the respiratory events occurring during VNS on time and abnormal sleep architecture including prolonged sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) latency, increased slow wave sleep, and pseudo spindles. The respiratory events were not associated with significant sleep fragmentation or desaturation. The AHI was 6.4/hour. Respiratory events improved with CPAP 7 cmH20 during titration PSG. She will be followed up in the sleep clinic to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP therapy. Conclusion There is a complex relationship between epilepsy and SDB. Antiepileptics and VNS can cause new onset or worsening SDB. Management options for VNS-induced SDB include PAP therapy, changing VNS settings, or alternate therapies for refractory epilepsy. A multimodal approach requiring input from the patient, a sleep specialist, and an epileptologist is recommended for optimal results. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "We present a rare case of Non 24-Hour Sleep Wake Rhythm Disorder (N24SWD) in a sighted patient with normal functioning and intelligence. N24SWD is rare in non-blind patients. Sighted patients reported in the literature have had significant psychiatric, intellectual, developmental, or medical comorbidities. A 23-year-old male PhD student presented with a 5-year history of difficulty falling asleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. His sleep and wake times were variable, but he averaged 8 hours of sleep in 24 hours. Two years before presenting to our sleep center, he underwent polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. It was significant for mean sleep latency of 5.5 minutes and normal AHI. Morning armodafinil was started for possible diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnolence by his previous sleep specialist. For insomnia, temazepam, zolpidem, and diphenhydramine were prescribed with minimal success. His medical history was significant for mild depression and anxiety, diagnosed three years after the onset of his circadian symptoms. It is currently being managed nonpharmacologically with optimal symptom control. For workup, 20-weeks of sleep diary data was obtained. During this time, he was on leave from school and allowed himself to wake and sleep spontaneously. He also abstained from all pharmacotherapy. The data showed progressive delay in sleep and wake times between 1 to 3 hours, consistent with N24SWD. Two weeks of actigraphy were obtained, confirming these results. He responded well to nightly melatonin. Morning light therapy and armodafinil were also prescribed, which the patient has not yet started. His functioning at his graduate school has significantly improved. Unlike many previously reported cases of N24SWD in sighted patients, our patient does not have intellectual and developmental disabilities. His mild depression and anxiety are well-controlled and were perhaps secondary to N24SWD. In previously reported cases, limited or inappropriate exposure to light or other entraining cues was noted, which was not the case in this patient.",

Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night).

In contrast to other rhythmic bioparameters, the diurnal BP rhythm is largely dependent on activity and sleep rather than on clock time. This has been demonstrated by the BP characteristics after shifted sleeping and working phases, during transition from sleep to wakefulness, and by the influence of sleep and activities on the 24-h BP curve during normal daily routines. Whereas the circadian rhythm of BP is predominantly governed by external time triggers, endogenous rhythmicity can only be detected by time microscopic analysis or in conditions where effects of external time triggers are almost excluded.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is 1 to 5 cases per million population. Milder forms of KLS can mimic narcolepsy, circadian rhythm disorders, idiopathic hypersomnia, and mood disorders. A 15 year old white male with no significant past medical history, psychiatric history or family history of sleep disorders presented with episodic excessive daytime sleepiness. He reported a total of six episodes, lasting 2–3 days, with two per year in 2016, 2017, and 2018. During the events, he slept 15–18 hours per day with difficulty awakening, slowed cognitive function, a sensation of derealization and depersonalization, compulsive eating and hypersexuality. In between these episodes, he returned to his baseline, sleeping for 8 hours on weekdays and 13 hours on weekends with sleep latencies of less than 30 minutes. The patient denied symptoms of depression or anxiety. His school performance was below average. The physical exam was normal except for a BMI of 32. The MRI of brain and the EEG were normal. The polysomnogram showed mild snoring, decreased sleep efficiency (83.9%), a prolonged sleep latency (48 minutes), a normal REM sleep latency (117 minutes), and decreased total REM sleep (62 minutes, 15.4%). There was no significant sleep-related breathing, periodic limb movements, nocturnal hypoxemia, or parasomnia. No seizures were seen. The multiple sleep latency test was normal. Actigraphy showed more than 16 hours of sleep a day during the episodes and 7–8 hours of sleep per day at baseline. Bedtime was delayed to between 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM regardless of whether he was in an episode or at baseline. The patient’s presentation would support the diagnosis of mild KLS, however, the shorter duration of the episodes is atypical. Confounding factors such as poor sleep hygiene and severe circadian rhythm disorder make certainty of this diagnosis more challenging.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a state of 'suspended consciousness', a temporary interruption of sensorimotor interaction with the environment. Clinically, the distinguishing feature of sleep, in contrast to coma, is the ease with which the sleeping subject can be roused to awareness of the external world. Between alertness and coma are a variety of altered states of consciousness. Palliative sedation refers to the intentional clinical practice of suppressing consciousness to control refractory symptoms during the last days or hours of life, in a manner that is ethically acceptable to the patient, family and healthcare providers. The intractable symptoms, which have proven non-responsive to all other interventions, are contained by the induction and the continuance of deep sedation. Deep sedation may need to be maintained until death; the duration is usually in the range of 1–6 days. Trial releases of deep sedation can be orchestrated, if required, by withholding the dose or administering flumazenil. The dosage necessary to induce deep sedation is variable.",

We describe two young women with acute autonomic neuropathy who presented with gastrointestinal involvement heralding widespread dysautonomia and review 26 additional cases of acute autonomic neuropathy from the English language literature. Acute autonomic neuropathy can be primarily cholinergic without orthostatic hypotension (26%) or pandysautonomic (74%) involving sympathetic adrenergic functions. Onset has been temporally related to viral syndromes in 20% of cases, with autonomic deficits usually evolving over 1 to 3 weeks. Gastroparesis (69%) and syncope (12%) are frequent presenting complaints. Spinal fluid protein levels are often (75%) elevated in pandysautonomic subtypes. Prolonged and incomplete recovery is the rule (60%), with persistent gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. Other specific diseases that occasionally mimic acute autonomic neuropathy include botulism, porphyria, amyloidosis, and paracarcinomatous neuropathies. Acute autonomic neuropathy shares several clinical features with acute idiopathic polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barré syndrome), suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis.

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein.

It is reported that the prevalence of chronic sleep-related complaints in older adults is over 50%, which is higher than that in younger adults. The etiology of sleep disorders in older adults is considered to be multifactorial, consisting of normal age-related changes(e.g., sleep fragmentation, earlier awakening, and decreased slow wave sleep), medical or psychiatric diseases (e.g., lifestyle-related diseases, dementia, delirium, and depression), primary age-related sleep disorders(e.g., sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movement disorders), or a combination of these factors. Because sleep disorders in older adults may have implications for quality of life, it is crucial to distinguish normal age-related sleep changes from those originating from pathological processes. This mini-review discusses crucial points in the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is the most common autosomal recessive ataxia. This disorder is associated with progressive development of sensory and cerebellar ataxia, along with cardiomyopathy and scoliosis. In the pediatric population, FA can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypoventilation; REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is not well described in the pediatric literature. A 16 year old male with a history of FA, cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, and severe OSA treated with Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) therapy presented to the pediatric home ventilator clinic with symptoms of daytime fatigue and hypersomnolence with reported inability to tolerate bilevel PAP therapy with spontaneous –timed mode. By parent report, he consistently took off his mask at night after 2–3 hours of use, had vocalizations and excessive movements during sleep. Given concern for intolerance to NIPPV or suboptimal treatment of sleep-disordered breathing, the patient underwent a retitration polysomnogram (PSG) resulting in the initiation of Pressure Control / Average Volume Assured Pressure Support (PC/AVAPS) therapy. Notably, the patient was also seen on PSG to remove his mask several times during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep resulting in frequent awakenings and sleep fragmentation. The patient was sent to a neurologist specializing in movement disorders and was diagnosed with REM sleep behavior disorder. The patient was trialed on melatonin, both 5 and 10 mg, without benefit. He was then started on clonazepam with titration up to 1 mg at bedtime which effectively controlled his nocturnal movements. On clonazepam, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in compliance with NIPPV therapy and improvement in both daytime fatigue and hypersomnolence. Pediatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia have high risk for OSA and hypoventilation often requiring NIPPV. In this population, RBD, although rare, should be considered as a potential cause for the NIPPV non-adherence.",

Especially, SDB has been gathering much attention as sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) in clinical physicians last three decades. SAS is characterized with heavy snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity. Pathophysiology of SAS is repeated obstructions of upper airway (pharyngeal sites) during sleep, so that marked hypoxemia and arousals occur. When SAS is severe and hypoxemia continues for long time, cardiovascular systems are much affected. Recent studies demonstrate that SAS is directly associated with hypertension, stroke, cardiac failure, and cardiac death. Another important clinical problem in patients with SAS is excessive daytime sleepiness that occurs due to repeated arousals during sleep. It has been reported that patients with SAS have more traffic car accidents. SAS impairs not only physical conditions but also mental and social conditions. Sleep disturbances, such as sleep loss, insomnia, and hypersomnia are also major health problem. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrated that sleep disturbances are common in general population. To understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of sleep disturbances are clinically important and useful for general physicians.",

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time.

      "abstract": "T he epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign.In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness.T he epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures.Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity-from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development-can lead to seizures.Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors.Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy.Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy.A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy.",

These symptoms are parts of the discontinuation syndrome and are very different from relapse or recurrence. The discontinuation syndrome appears within 1 week and lasts about 3 weeks after discontinuation of the antidepressant. In the vast majority of cases, the symptomatology is self-limiting. Sometimes, in the presence of a severe syndrome, reintroduction of the antidepressant induces a rapid resolution of the symptoms. In fact, the discontinuation of the antidepressant should be progressive.",

Insomnia is characterized by difficulty with initiation and/or maintenance of sleep, driven primarily by cognitive behavioural processes. CRSWDs manifest because of alterations to the endogenous circadian clock (intrinsic) or as a consequence of environmental circumstances (extrinsic). This chapter reviews evidence-based treatments for the management of insomnia and intrinsic CRSWDs (delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder, non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder, irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder). The chapter covers cognitive behavioural therapies, sleep-promoting hypnotics, phototherapy, and exogenous melatonin administration. The chapter also highlight gaps in the existing clinical science and reflects on emergent therapeutic approaches.",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

From the day of deprivation – in the self-rating from the 4th day – up to 1 week later a therapeutic effect can be observed. The psychic part of the symptomatology was more reduced than the somatic one. Compared to total and partial SD during the 2nd half of the night, there is, on average, a smaller therapeutic effect which occurs later. The diurnal variation of the depressive symptomatology is less influenced. According to the period without sleep, the circadian course of the heart rate is less and differently modified by SD during the 1st half of the night. Only an existing diurnal variation (before SD) is a predictor of the prompt effect. Implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic SD were discussed. For clinical practice, SD during the 2nd half of the night is the method of choice.",

These typically consisted of elementary visual hallucinations of flashing lights obscuring his left visual field for a period of 2 days, associated with a severe frontal headache initially diagnosed as migraine. These episoaes of simple partial SE then evolved to a complex partial seizure (CPS) or secondarily eneralized seizure. There were unique EEG features, including: (a) the perception of a flash of light in the left visual field with a single sharpislow wave discharge over the right occipital lobe, (b) right occipital lobe epileptiform activity during the prolonged aura, and (c) an abnormal response to photic stimulation, with occipital lobe discharges during low rates of stimulation (3–5 Hz), time‐locked to the stimzlus. High‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with quantitative morphometry demonstrated that the right hemisphere and right caudate nucleus were smaller than those on the left. An abnormal gyral pattern was also noted over the right parietal region. Occasionally, distinguishing occipital lobe epilepsy from migraine may be difficult.",

      "title": "1250 Agrypnia Excitata in a Patient with Paraneoplastic Autoimmune Encephalitis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Agrypnia Excitata (AE) is a syndrome characterized by loss of sleep with permanent motor and autonomic hyper activation. This case describes this peculiar syndrome in a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis. Report of Case DG is a 35 yr old male with a history of anti-Ma2 limbic encephalitis secondary to cystic teratoma of the left testis diagnosed 6 months prior to presenting in Sleep Clinic. His parents described significant sleep disturbances including short sleep and wake periods throughout the day and night with no apparent pattern, acting out dreams, motor activity during sleep including pulling at his clothes or using his hands to manipulate invisible objects. Additionally they described low-grade fevers, and severe hyperphagia. Polysomnogram showed absence of slow-wave sleep and what appeared to be an admixture of stage 1 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) with rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Multiple sleep-latency testing (MSLT) demonstrated a mean sleep latency of 5.2 minutes and four sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed persistent inflammation of the mesial temporal lobes and hippocampal region. Cerebral spinal fluid testing showed persistent anti-Ma2 antibodies. Based on this clinical presentation we made a diagnosis of Agrypnia Excitata. Conclusion Agrypnia Excitata is a syndrome characterized by loss of the normal sleep-wake rhythm. Sleep consists of the disappearance of spindle-delta activities, and persistent stage 1 NREM sleep mixed with recurrent episodes of REM sleep. The second hallmark of AE is persistent motor and autonomic hyperactivity observed during wake and sleep. AE has been described in three distinct clinical syndromes: Morvan Syndrome (autoimmune encephalitis), Fatal Familial Insomnia, and Delirium tremens. The pathogenesis of AE consists of intra-limbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from cortico-limbic inhibitory control. In autoimmune encephalitis, antibodies that act on voltage-gated potassium channels within the limbic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, commonly known as insomnia, are a significant public health problem. Insomnia has a close health relationship with other psychological illnesses such as mental disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. This sleep disorder usually occurs when the body is unsatisfied with the duration or quality of sleep and has difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep patterns. Until now, this problem still occurs frequently, especially in teenagers who often do not have good sleep patterns. This can be caused by stress or mental disorders during the day or more often due to other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as depression. This research aims to determine the relationship between depression or anxiety disorders and sleep disorders (insomnia), as well as to find out whether there are other things related to depression that result in insomnia. The method used is a literature review. The criteria for articles used are those published in the last 10 years. Based on the research that has been collected, it has been found that there are factors that state that depression can affect sleep patterns. A study states that exercise can improve sleep quality and has many other health benefits as well. AbstrakGangguan tidur yang umum dikenal sebagai insomnia, merupakan salah satu masalah kesehatan masyarakat yang signifikan. Insomnia memiliki hubungan kesehatan yang erat dengan penyakit psikis lainnya seperti gangguan kejiwaan, gangguan kecemasan maupun depresi. Gangguan tidur ini biasanya terjadi saat tubuh tidak mendapatkan kepuasaan terhadap durasi atau kualitas tidur dan kesulitan dalam memulai ataupun mempertahankan pola tidur. Sampai saat ini masalah ini masih sering terjadi terutama terhadap anak remaja yang sering tidak memiliki pola tidur yang baik. Hal ini dapat disebabkan oleh tekanan atau gangguan pikiran pada siang hari atau yang lebih sering karena adanya gangguan medis atau kejiwaan lainnya, seperti gangguan depresi. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui gambaran hubungan gangguan depresi atau kecemasan dan gangguan tidur (insomnia), serta untuk mengetahui adanya hal lain yang berhubungan dengan depresi yang mengakibatkan insomnia. Metode yang digunakan ialah literature review. Adapun kriteria artikel yang digunakan adalah yang diterbitkan pada 10 tahun terakhir. Berdasarkan dari penelitian yang telah dikumpulkan telah didapatkan adanya faktor yang menyatakan bahwa depresi dapat mempengaruhi pola tidur. Sebuah penelitian menyatakan bahwa olahraga dapat meningkatkan kualitas tidur dan memiliki banyak manfaat juga pada kesehatan lainnya.",

This syndrome is characterized by nocturnal respiratory disturbances, blood oxygen desaturations, sleep fragmentation, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Opinions arc divided concerning the exact relationship between the observed cognitive deficits, nocturnal hypoxia, sleep disruption, and impaired daytime alertness. In the present study, morning neuropsychological function of 26 moderate to severe middle-aged sleep apneics is compared to that of 22 primary insomniacs. There were no performance differences on a range of neuropsychological tests among the two patient groups. In addition, the data suggest that morning alertness impairment, which is closely associated with a lack of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is of major importance in inducing poorer cognitive performance in patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea.

The frequency of headache has been substantially increased over the last 30 years due to changes in lifestyle. Controlling the trigger factors and lifestyle changes (e.g. regular sleep, meal time, exercise, etc.) are the first step management strategies in headaches. Sleep and headache have bidirectional effects on each other. While diminished and poor quality of sleep can be a trigger factor for headache (e.g. migraine and tension-type headache (TTH)), some types of headache like hypnic headache and cluster-type headache mainly occur during sleep. Patients with headache may have poor sleep quality, reduced total sleep time, more awakenings, and alterations in architecture of sleep recorded by polysomnography. Progression to chronic forms of headache may also be associated with the duration and quality of sleep. Even though pathophysiology of headache and sleep disorders shares the same brain structures and pathways, sleep disturbances are commonly underestimated and underdiagnosed in headache patients. Clinicians should consider and behold the treatment of accompanying sleep complaints for an effective management of headache.",

      "abstract": "Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is common. It occurs in up to 20% of 5 year olds and 10% of 10 year olds, with a spontaneous remission rate of 14% per year. Weekly daytime wetting occurs in 5% of children, most of whom (80%) also wet the bed. Bedwetting can have a considerable impact on children and families, affecting a child's self-esteem and interpersonal relationships, and his or her performance at school. Primary nocturnal enuresis (never consistently dry at night) should be distinguished from secondary nocturnal enuresis (previously dry for at least 6 months). Important risk factors for primary nocturnal enuresis include family history, nocturnal polyuria, impaired sleep arousal and bladder dysfunction. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is more likely to be caused by factors such as urinary tract infections, diabetes mellitus and emotional stress. The treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting with no daytime symptoms) is an alarm device, with desmopressin as second-line therapy. Treatment for non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting with daytime symptoms--urgency and frequency, with or without incontinence) should initially focus on the daytime symptoms.Bedwetting without daytime symptoms, the most common toileting problem, can be effectively treated with an alarm device.",

      "abstract": "The integrity of time consciousness is the condition of possibility of the identity through time of an object of perception as well as of the person who perceives it. I will present our findings about abnormal time experience (ATE) in people with schizophrenia. These data may support the following hypothesis: if the continuity of temporal experience disintegrates (of which ATE are experiential manifestations), overarching meaningful units are no longer available, thereby creating temporal gaps, e.g., in one's stream of consciousness. In some cases, thoughts that are no longer experienced as embedded in one's stream of thoughts are experienced as, e.g., thought interferences, blockages, insertion or withdrawal. These symptoms cannot be explained as a mere disturbance of attention or comprehension at the level of semantic combinations. Rather, the disturbance could be searched for at a more basic level where the temporal coherence of conscious awareness is constituted. A failure of the constitutive temporal synthesis may create micro-gaps of conscious experience. In the most severe cases, thoughts or other mental phenomena that are no longer embedded in the continuity of basic self-experience may appear in consciousness as “erratic blocks” and experienced as being inserted, or, if further externalized, as auditory hallucinations (“voices”). This coheres with the hypothesis that a breakdown of temporality may be bound up with the breakdown of prereflexive self-awareness.

      "abstract": "We reviewed sleep and dream-related clinical symptoms in a set of four neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s Disease, REM Behavior Disorder, Narcolepsy and Depression) characterized by severe reductions in dopaminergic function. Sleep findings included excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased rapid eye movement sleep times (REM%), increased REM density or bursts of REMs, reduced REM latency periods, and sleep onset REM (SOREM). Clinical symptoms included perseverative or rigid thinking and personality styles, frontal lobe impairment, increased complaints of, or vulnerability to negative affect, and increased vivid and unpleasant dreams. The increased vulnerability to unpleasant dreams was particularly interesting as descriptions of dream content were strikingly similar across all 4 disorders. Dreams of feeling threatened or being attacked by animals or dangerous creatures were very frequent. We hypothesize that the cluster of sleep, dream and cognitive changes associated with these four disorders can be explained by assuming that lowered dopaminergic tone leads to a disinhibition of REM physiology and amygdalar activity and that this disinhibition of REM and amygdalar function yields unpleasant dreams, negative affect, and frontal lobe impairment. Careful study of the cluster of co-occurring symptoms identified here may illuminate 1) the ways in which dopamine might function in regulation of sleep states, and 2) aspects of the neurology of dream content.

Efficacy has been reported with both continuous dosing (all cycle) and intermittent or luteal phase dosing (from ovulation to menses). Efficacy may be less with intermittent dosing, particularly for premenstrual physical symptoms. The efficacy of symptom-onset dosing (medication taken only on luteal days when symptoms occur) needs further systematic study. Women going through the menopausal transition may need to adjust their antidepressant dosing regimen due to the change in frequency of menstruation. Anxiolytics, calcium, chasteberry and cognitive-behaviour therapy may also have a role in the treatment of premenstrual symptoms.",

This is especially relevant when a patient presents with nonspecific symptoms (agitation, tachycardia, tremor, diarrhea, or a combination) that are often early and transient side effects of selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). An overenthusiastic diagnosis of the serotonin syndrome at this stage may actually deprive the patient of the benefits of SSRI treatment for depression. Second, SSRIs and other proserotonergic agents act, by definition, by raising serotonergic activity in the brain. How and when does one decide that this activity is excessive? As Boyer and Shannon rightly point out, “No laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis of the serotonin syndrome.” Hence, the term “serotonin syndrome” might be a misnomer, because we do not know whether it is an excess of serotonin that causes the syndrome, even in its fullblown form.

Vigilance impairment and neuropsychological deficits are among the main symptoms seen in this condition. One of the major questions in this field concerns the reciprocal interactions between nocturnal hypoxemia, sleep disruption, excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive deficits. Results of this study suggest that vigilance impairment is attributable mostly to nocturnal hypoxemia. However, in cognitive deficits, hypoxemia seems to play a major role in executive and psychomotor tasks, whereas attention and memory functions appear to be related to vigilance impairment. After treatment, hypoxemia-related deficits and some degree of sleepiness persist. These results raise the possibility of an irreversible anoxic central nervous system (CNS) damage in severe OSAS.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Three groups of adult epileptic subjects with simple partial, complex partial, and generalized seizures and normal control subjects completed a brief self‐report sleep questionnaire. The simple partial and complex partial groups indicated significantly more sleep disorder symptoms, especially frequent night awakenings. The generalized group was most similar to the controls. Irrespective of seizure type, the epileptic patients with the most frequent seizures also had the most sleep disturbances. Sleep disorder symptoms did not increase with age in the seizure groups. It would thus seem that epileptic patients with partial seizures and those with more frequent seizures are at risk for developing sleep disorders. RÉSUMÉ On a demandéà 3 groupes de sujets adultes épileptiques (avec crises partielles élémentaires, crises partielles complexes et crises généralisées) et à un groupe de contr&amp;#x006f;&amp;#x030c;le de sujets normaux, de remplir un questionnaire concernant leur sommeil. Le groupe des sujets avec crises partielles, élémentaires et complexes, ont signalé des troubles du sommeil significativement plus importans, en particulier des réveils nocturnes. Le groupe des sujets avec crises généralisées était très semblable au groupe de contr&amp;#x006f;&amp;#x030c;le. Sans tenir compte du type des crises ce sont les épileptiques avec crises les plus fréquentes qui avaient le plus de troubles du sommeil. Les troubles du sommeil n'augmentaient pas avec l'a&amp;#x030c;ge dans le groupe des épileptiques. Il semblerait donc que les épileptiques ayant des crises partielles et ceux ayant des crises fréquentes risquent de développer des troubles du sommeil. RESUMEN Un breve cuestionario sobre el sueño ha sido cumplimentado personalmente por tres grupos de sujetos epilépticos adultos con ataques parciales simples, partiales complejos, ataques generalizados y sujetos normales control. Los grupos de ataques parciales simples y complejos declararon significativamente más síntomas de sueño alterado y, especialmente, frecuentes inter‐rupciones del sueño durante la noche. El grupo de ataques generalizados fué más similar a los contróles. En todos los tipos de ataques los enfermo con ataques más frecuentes tenfan más trastornos del sueño. Estos trastornos no aumentaron con la edad en los grupos de ataques. Así pues parece que los epilépticos con ataques parciales y los que tienen ataques más frecuentemente están en riesgo de desarrollar trastornos del sueño. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Drei Gruppen erwachsener Anfallskranker mit einfachen und komplexen parti len und generalisierten Anfällen sowie normale Kontrollen erstellten einen kurzen Schlafbericht. Die Patienten mit einfachen und komplexen Partialanfällen berichteten signifikant häufiger über Symptome einer Schlafstörung besonders über häufiges nächtliches Erwachen. Die Gruppe mit generalisierten Anfällen entsprach am ehesten den Kontrollen. Unabhängig vom Anfalltyp hatten die Patienten mit den häufigsten Anfällen auch die häufigsten Schlafstörungen. Die Schlafstörungen nahmen in der Gruppe der Anfallskranken nicht mit dem Alter zu. Es ergibt sich daraus, daß Anfallskranke mit Partialanfällen und solche mit häufigeren Anfällen am ehesten Schlafstörungen entwickeln.",

      "title": "Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in patients with narcolepsy is associated with hypocretin-1 deficiency",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is characterized by dream-enacting behaviour and impaired motor inhibition during rapid eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but also reported in narcolepsy with cataplexy. Most narcolepsy with cataplexy patients lack the sleep–wake, and rapid eye movement sleep, motor-regulating hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and hypocretin deficiency are rare in narcolepsy without cataplexy. We hypothesized that rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder coexists with cataplexy in narcolepsy due to hypocretin deficiency. In our study, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder was diagnosed by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2nd edition) criteria in 63 narcolepsy patients with or without cataplexy. Main outcome measures were: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms; short and long muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep; and periodic and non-periodic limb movements per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Outcome variables were analysed in relation to cataplexy and hypocretin deficiency with uni- and multivariate logistic/linear regression models, controlling for possible rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder biasing factors (age, gender, disease duration, previous anti-cataplexy medication). Only hypocretin deficiency independently predicted rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms (relative risk = 3.69, P = 0.03), long muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement sleep (ln-coefficient = 0.81, P < 0.01), and short muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement sleep (ln-coefficient = 1.01, P < 0.01). Likewise, periodic limb movements per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep were only associated with hypocretin deficiency (P < 0.01). A significant association between hypocretin deficiency and cataplexy was confirmed (P < 0.01). In a sub-analysis, hypocretin deficiency suggested the association of periodic limb movements and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder outcomes (symptoms, non-periodic short and long muscle activity) in rapid eye movement sleep. Our results support the hypothesis that hypocretin deficiency is independently associated with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in narcolepsy. Thus, hypocretin deficiency is linked to the two major disturbances of rapid eye movement sleep motor regulation in narcolepsy: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and cataplexy. Hypocretin deficiency is also significantly associated with periodic limb movements in rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep, and provides a possible pathophysiological link between rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and periodic limb movements in narcolepsy. The study supports the hypothesis that an impaired hypocretin system causes a general instability of motor regulation during wakefulness, rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep in human narcolepsy.",

      "abstract": "Key Clinical Message This study suggests that severe obstructive sleep apnea can present as sleep‐related epileptic or non‐epileptic seizures. A detailed history and physical examination, along with polysomnography and video electroencephalography findings can lead to the correct diagnosis. Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by recurrent episodes of the upper airway complete or partial collapse while sleeping. The obstructive episodes result in gradual suffocation that increases breathing attempts till the person is awakened. The main manifestations are excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, observed episodes of stopped breathing, and abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking. Nevertheless, there are very few reports of patients with OSA, manifesting other symptoms such as seizure‐like movements. Differentiating OSA with nocturnal seizures could be challenging due to their overlapping features. A 53‐year‐old man presented to the clinic, experiencing seizure‐like involuntary movements during nocturnal sleep for the past 2 years with a frequency of 2–3 times per night. Neurologic examinations were normal. Further evaluation with polysomnography revealed impaired arousal followed by seizure‐like movements during sleep. Video electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges, ruling out the nocturnal seizure diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with OSA. Subsequently, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment resolved all symptoms.",

      "title": "Menopause Related Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep difficulty is one of the hallmarks of menopause. Following recent studies showing no cardiac benefit and increased breast cancer, the question of indications for hormonal therapy has become even more pertinent. Three sets of sleep disorders are associated with menopause: insomnia/depression, sleep disordered breathing and fibromyalgia. The primary predictor of disturbed sleep architecture is the presence of vasomotor symptoms. This subset of women has lower sleep efficiency and more sleep complaints. The same group is at higher risk of insomnia and depression. The \"domino theory\" of sleep disruption leading to insomnia followed by depression has the most scientific support. Estrogen itself may also have an antidepressant as well as a direct sleep effect. Treatment of insomnia in responsive individuals may be a major remaining indication for hormone therapy. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) increases markedly at menopause for reasons that include both weight gain and unclear hormonal mechanisms. Due to the general under-recognition of SDB, health care providers should not assume sleep complaints are due to vasomotor related insomnia/depression without considering SDB. Fibromyalgia has gender, age and probably hormonal associations. Sleep complaints are almost universal in FM. There are associated polysomnogram (PSG) findings. FM patients have increased central nervous system levels of the nociceptive neuropeptide substance P (SP) and lower serotonin levels resulting in a lower pain threshold to normal stimuli. High SP and low serotonin have significant potential to affect sleep and mood. Treatment of sleep itself seems to improve, if not resolve FM. Menopausal sleep disruption can exacerbate other pre-existing sleep disorders including RLS and circadian disorders.",

Common causes of daytime sleepiness include obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and medication side effects. The differential diagnosis also includes narcolepsy and restless legs syndrome (RLS). In many cases, the answers to a few simple questions can provide the necessary clues to the diagnosis. Loud snoring is associated with OSAHS, while sudden muscle weakness triggered by intense emotion is consistent with narcolepsy. Referral for sleep evaluation is indicated to evaluate for OSAHS, narcolepsy, RLS, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Methods of measuring daytime sleepiness include the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. (J Respir Dis. 2005;26(6):253-259)",

However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

REM sleep-related sinus arrests such as these, which may occur in apparently healthy subjects but are undetected, may explain some cases of sudden, unexpected death during sleep. Polygraphic monitoring during sleep may be helpful in delineating the pathophysiology of the sleep-related arrhythmia in persons with daytime cardiac arrhythmias thought to be secondary to abnormal vagal tone. The possibility of nocturnal asystole should be considered in patients such as those described here.",

      "title": "Associations of sleep disturbance with ADHD: implications for treatment",
      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly associated with disordered or disturbed sleep. The relationships of ADHD with sleep problems, psychiatric comorbidities and medications are complex and multidirectional. Evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of ADHD with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. ADHD is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). Psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with ADHD for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. Long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. Current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of ADHD, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between ADHD and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: ADHD may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic ADHD; ADHD and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and ADHD and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.",

The majority of patients experienced one or more consecutive 48-hour sleep-wake cycles (alternate nights with no sleep) when they switched out of depression into mania of hypomania. During a depressive phase, nine rapidly cycling patients were asked to simulate a 48-hour sleep-wake cycle by remaining awake for 40 hours (one night's total sleep deprivation). Eight switched out of depression, and seven were rated as manic or hypomanic; indicating that sleep loss (such as occurs with spontaneous 48-hour sleep-wake cycles) may help to trigger switches from depression to mania. The 48-hour sleep-wake cycles in patients may depend on a mechanism that is normally present in all humans, since normal persons also spontaneously experience near-48 hour sleep-wake cycles in certain experimental conditions.",

This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "title": "Escitalopram-induced extrapyramidal symptoms",
      "abstract": "Sir, Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for a variety of clinical conditions due to their relatively safe side-effect profile. Among the various classes of antidepressants, SSRIs are the common offenders producing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs). The incidence of EPS is high with escitalopram (12%) followed by sertraline (11%), paroxetine (10%), and fluoxetine (8%).[1] The SSRIs produces reversible or irreversible motor disturbances through pathophysiological changes in basal ganglion motor system by altering the dopamine receptors postsynaptically.[2] A 34-year-old female presented with complaints of sadness of mood, crying spells, feeling lonely, decreased interest in day-to-day activities, lethargy and disturbed biological functions for the last 6 months. Her past and family history and personal history was noncontributory. General and systemic examination was within normal limits. Mental status examination revealed decreased psychomotor activity, depressed affect, depressive cognitions with well-preserved insight. A diagnosis of moderate depressive disorder was made, and she was started on escitalopram 10 mg/day along with clonazepam 0.5 mg at night time. She was maintaining well and escitalopram 10 mg was continued for the next 18 months as per patient's request. 18th month, she presented with complaints of slurring of speech, drooling of saliva, decreased bodily movements, and slowness in walking. Neurological examination revealed bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dysarthric speech, and tremor of hands. Routine biochemical tests and head MRI, EEG were done and were found to be normal. No history of any other drug use/abuse, head injury, seizures, fever or movement disorder was reported. A diagnosis of escitalopram-induced acute extrapyramidal syndrome was made after excluding other possible causes. Escitalopram was immediately discontinued, the patient was reassured, and trihexyphenidyl 2 mg bid was started. Follow-up after 2 weeks reported significant improvement. Subsequently trihexyphenidyl was stopped and dothiepin 50 mg/day was started to control the depressive symptoms. The patient was followed-up for the next 6 months without any symptom recurrence. The Naranjo probability scale applied retrospectively revealed a score of 6, pointing to a \"probable\" drug reaction. The data for escitalopram-induced EPS is rare except in few cases.[34] The potential risk factors for EPS induced by antidepressants are advancing age, female gender, preexisting extrapyramidal disorder, other concurrent neuroleptic medications and pharmacokinetic interaction through CYP2D6 inhibition.[1] Other than the female gender, none of these risk factors were present in our patient. Researchers have extrapolated a link between antidepressant-induced EPS and the CYP2D6 phenotype. On analyzing the risk factors for these reactions during treatment with SSRIs, including the CYP2D6 phenotype, serotonin, and dopamine transporter and receptor polymorphisms, it was noted that the risk of EPS with SSRIs seemed to increase with advanced age and the presence of the A1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor gene Taq1A.[5] Being a young patient, the possibility of young-onset parkinsonian disease was considered in which, family history of parkinsonism is an important risk factor.[6] Our patient's history was not significant for either parkinsonism or any other movement disorder. In rat models of EPS induced by SSRIs, a specific effect on tyrosine hydroxylase, which is a speed-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis in substantia nigra has been reported. Tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis was significantly decreased by SSRIs in substantia nigra, and the serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibition can activate microglia and alter the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis, and these changes may play a role in mediating the EPS associated with SERT inhibitors.[7] Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) may represent a preexisting vulnerability to future Parkinson's disease. Treatment of DIP involves discontinuation of the offending drugs, which usually promotes remission of the parkinsonian syndrome within a short time, although parkinsonism may sometimes persist and require dopaminergic treatment. One atypical feature in our patient was that compared to previously reported cases where EPS developed few weeks after initiation of escitalopram, in the index patient EPS developed only 2 years after starting escitalopram. However, the EPS was reversed after a short course of anticholinergic treatment. The reason for late onset of EPS needs further exploration. This is an attempt to create an awareness of drug-induced EPS as adverse reaction in patients taking escitalopram even after months or years of therapy so that timely recognition can prevent such adverse effects.

Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

The disorders also contribute to significant cognitive, emotional, and physical health challenges. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the US population. It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early-morning waking and is linked to daytime distress and impairment. Common sleep disruptors include environmental factors such as noise, light, and air pollution and also personal habits such as excessive screen use before bedtime. Evaluating patients with insomnia in primary care requires integrating sleep health assessments into routine visits and use of insomnia screening tools and sleep diaries for accurate diagnosis. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia are the preferred treatments. Pharmacotherapy or combination therapy (with cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and pharmacotherapy) may be considered when these interventions are ineffective. Family physicians should weigh the risks and benefits of insomnia medication use carefully for all patients but especially for older adults because of potential adverse effects. Managing insomnia effectively in primary care involves a comprehensive approach, prioritizing nonpharmacologic strategies, regular monitoring, and patient-centered care.",

There is an increased risk of death due to accidents, suicide and other medical conditions. There are also cases where the death appears to be directly related to epilepsy itself, usually referred to as Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). This information is not always passed from doctor to patient, for various reasons. Epilepsy share is an uncontrolled electrical discharge from nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. This is the part of the brain that integrates higher mental functions, general movement, and the functions of the internal organs in the abdominal cavity, perception, and behavioral reactions. The early warning system will be based on three factors: 1. Detection of abnormal electrical activity of brain. 2.

      "abstract": "Neonatal brain injuries represent a group of common yet heterogeneous disorders, which result in long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle is an uncommon disorder, not included under the accepted definitions of functional psychoses. We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

      "abstract": "In humans, slow-wave sleep (SWS) consists of stages 3 and 4 of non rapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep. The low-frequency, high-amplitude slow waves that dominate the electroencephalogram (EEG) during SWS can be quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA). SWS and SWA are regulated very accurately in response to variations in the duration and intensity of wakefulness and sleep. SWA declines more or less independently of circadian phase during the course of a sleep episode, indicating that it is primarily under homeostatic rather than circadian control. An age-related decline in SWS and SWA is well established. In some studies, apprehension, depression and insomnia have been associated with reductions in SWS and SWA. Experimental reductions of SWS through SWS deprivation (without altering total sleep time or REM duration) have been reported to lead to an increase in daytime sleep propensity and reductions in performance. SWS and SWA are therefore thought to contribute to the recovery processes that occur during sleep. Most currently prescribed hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, suppress SWA. Some compounds have been shown to enhance SWS and SWA in healthy volunteers through GAT-1 inhibition, GABA-A modulation, GABA-B modulation, and 5HT2(A) antagonism. Pharmacological enhancement of SWS has also been observed in insomnia. The effects of SWS enhancement on other sleep parameters will be discussed.",

To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders. The best results are achieved if the early diagnosis of diseases accompanied by movement disorders is carried out using an interdisciplinary approach.",

Approximately 5% to 10% of all seven-year-olds have enuresis, and an estimated 5 to 7 million children in the United States have enuresis. The pathophysiology of primary nocturnal enuresis involves the inability to awaken from sleep in response to a full bladder, coupled with excessive nighttime urine production or a decreased functional capacity of the bladder. Initial evaluation should include a history, physical examination, and urinalysis. Several conditions, such as constipation, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, chronic kidney disease, and psychiatric disorders, are associated with enuresis. If identified, these conditions should be evaluated and treated. Treatment of primary monosymptomatic enuresis (i.e., the only symptom is nocturnal bed-wetting in a child who has never been dry) begins with counseling the child and parents on effective behavioral modifications. First-line treatments for enuresis include bed alarm therapy and desmopressin. The choice of therapy is based on the child's age and nighttime voiding patterns, and the desires of the child and family. Referral to a pediatric urologist is indicated for children with primary enuresis refractory to standard and combination therapies, and for children with some secondary causes of enuresis, including urinary tract malformations, recurrent urinary tract infections, or neurologic disorders.",

Sleep disorders can lead to worsening of seizure control and general medical condition of the patients. However, seizures themselves and types of epilepsy can affect the sleep architecture. One of the most frequent symptoms of disordered sleep in epilepsy patients is excessive daytime sleepiness, which can be a consequence of poor sleep quality due to frequent nocturnal seizures or excessive interictal epileptiform activity during sleep leading to frequent arousals. is frequently referred to antiepileptic drug side effects. In patients with frontal and temporal lobe epilepsies, which are more associated with sleep, the sleep architecture is significantly different from healthy individuals. They have more frequent arousals, disturbed relationship between sleep phases and stages, in particular inhibited REM-sleep phase. Most recent data on this problem are reviewed. Sleep patterns for different major epileptic syndromes are presented and some general recommendations for patient management, with a special consideration of sleep issues, are given.В обзорной статье представлена проблема ведения пациентов с эпилепсией с учетом влияния эпилептических приступов и других эпилептических синдромов на структуру сна. Нарушения сна могут приводить к ухудшению контроля над приступами и общего состояния пациентов. Но и сами приступы и особенности форм эпилепсии могут влиять на архитектуру сна. Один из самых частых симптомов нарушенного сна у больных эпилепсией - выраженная дневная сонливость, но она может быть следствием плохого качества сна из-за частых ночных приступов или выраженной интериктальной эпилептиформной активности во время сна, приводящей к частым микропробуждениям. У пациентов с эпилепсией лобной и височной долей, приступы которых часто связаны с состоянием сна, его структура значительно отличается от сна у здоровых людей: у них более часто встречаются микропробуждения, нарушается нормальное соотношение фаз сна, в частности угнетается фаза быстрого (REM) сна. В статье обобщены основные данные по рассматриваемой проблеме, полученные в последние годы. Представлена картина сна при основных эпилептических синдромах и сформулированы общие рекомендации по ведению пациентов с эпилепсией с учетом фактора сна.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy is a disorder of sleep characterized by pathologic daytime sleepiness classically divided into two major subtypes – those with or without cataplexy. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is thought to be related to hypocretin/orexin; pathologically low levels of hypocretin characterize narcolepsy with cataplexy. We present a complex case of weakness in a patient evaluated for narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 38 year-old male with a BMI of 33 presented with a decade of daytime sleepiness and sudden debilitating attacks of muscle weakness. He underwent level III home sleep testing revealing a respiratory event index of 5.3/h. After an unsuccessful trial of mandibular advancement, he was started on positive airways pressure (PAP) but continued to experience daytime sleepiness and episodes concerning for cataplexy including sensation of legs feeling stiff and falling with stress. He also described episodes of weakness while swimming with inability to stand or stabilize, prompting evaluation for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Sleep diary showed average nightly sleep of 6.5 hours, low sleep latency, and refreshing napping. He underwent PSG while using CPAP 8 cm H2O showing AHI 0.2/h, sleep time 6.2 hours, sleep latency 5.5 minutes and REM latency 33 minutes with evidence of REM sleep without atonia. He underwent MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of 7.6 minutes and 3/5 REM sleep onset periods. Therapeutic trials of venlafaxine and pitolisant did not result in symptomatic improvement, and further genetic testing with HLA DQB-1 was negative. CSF hypocretin measurement was normal (329 pg/mL, reference &amp;gt; 200 pg/mL). These effectively ruled out cataplexy as the cause of his weakness. He continued on PAP therapy, venlafaxine, and modafinil 200 mg for hypersomnia/narcolepsy without cataplexy with good response. Conclusion We present a complex case highlighting the utility of HLA and confirmatory CSF testing in the evaluation of cataplexy with episodes of acute weakness accompanying stress and strong emotion, with particularly dangerous events during swimming. Due to lack of therapeutic response despite positive MSLT, further testing with HLA and CSF hypocretin were pursued. This case highlights the limitations of history alone in the diagnosis of cataplexy, and the utility of advanced testing. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Psychiatric illness is an important potential cause of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hypersomnia, and narcolepsy-like symptoms. We report a case of hypersomnia and pseudo-cataplexy associated with schizoaffective disorder. Report of Case A 28-year-old man with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and schizoaffective disorder presented to our sleep medicine clinic complaining of EDS, cataplexy-like attacks, sleep paralysis, depressed mood, and dream intrusion. Questions about cataplexy often provoked brief episodes of speech arrest, eye closure, and neck flexion lasting a few seconds. An MSLT with CPAP showed a mean sleep latency of 3 minutes and 3 sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs); however, actigraphy showed that the SOREMPs occurred during the patient’s habitual sleep period and the patient discontinued a REM-suppressing medication within a few days of the study. The HLA-DQB1*0602 allele was absent. Following circadian adjustment, a repeat MSLT with CPAP showed zero sleep and no SOREMPs. The preceding polysomnogram showed a total sleep time (TST) of 7.8 hours, no epileptiform activity, adequately-treated OSA, and a REM latency of 53 minutes. Prior to these studies, two weeks of sleep diary and actigraphy showed a TST greater than 10 hours. Ultimately, treatment of the patient’s psychiatric disorder resulted in a reduction of his EDS and TST. Conclusion Patients with psychiatric illness can present with hypersomnia, EDS, and narcolepsy-like symptoms such as pseudo-cataplexy. Misdiagnosing such a patient with narcolepsy can lead to treatments capable of worsening the primary underlying psychiatric disturbance. MSLT results must be interpreted in the context of a patient’s clinical history and sleep schedule; if there is concern for a false positive result, repeat testing should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Circadian rhythm disorders, often misdiagnosed as primary insomnia, can be challenging to treat with medications alone. Effective management requires an integrated approach that combines behavioral therapy, circadian rhythm interventions, and lifestyle modifications[1,2]. This case details the treatment of a 59-year-old male with an irregular sleep-wake pattern, severe social anxiety, and restless legs syndrome (RLS). His treatment involved behavioral strategies and circadian rhythm interventions, resulting in significant improvements in his sleep and overall well-being. Report of case The patient presented with severe sleep disturbances, including spending up to 20 hours in bed per day, with a highly fragmented sleep schedule. His typical sleep pattern involved sleeping at 11:00 PM and waking at 3:15 AM, averaging 6–7 hours of broken sleep nightly, compounded by excessive daytime naps. Initial home sleep apnea testing revealed a total sleep time (TST) of 4 hours and 26 minutes, an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 0.7/hr, and a minimum oxygen saturation of 91%. Follow up polysomnography showed a TST of 175.5 minutes, with a sleep efficiency of 56%, an AHI of 1.0/hr, and a periodic limb movement index of 83.4/hour. An integrated treatment plan was initiated, combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), sleep environment modifications, and lifestyle changes. The patient was encouraged to adhere to a consistent sleep-wake schedule and reduce time spent in bed during the day. Additionally, he started an exercise program to help manage his RLS symptoms and joined a senior center for increased social engagement. Several sedative medications, including melatonin, hydroxyzine, and trazodone were gradually discontinued. The patient now uses doxepin for insomnia and gabapentin a few times per week for RLS symptoms. Following these interventions, he was able to maintain consolidated nighttime sleep. His RLS symptoms also improved with regular physical activity. Conclusion This case illustrates the effectiveness of an integrated treatment approach combining behavioral therapy, circadian rhythm interventions, and lifestyle changes in managing complex sleep disorders like circadian rhythm dysfunction and RLS. The patient’s use of CBT-i, exercise, and improved sleep hygiene led to a significant reduction in sleep fragmentation and a more regular sleep-wake cycle, as reflected in the improvement in patient’s symptoms.

They include non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias (eg, confusional arousals, sleep terrors, sleepwalking) and REM-related parasomnias (eg, nightmare disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep paralysis). Notable among these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. Early detection of this disorder is essential because it often precedes the motor symptoms of neurodegenerative conditions. Diagnostic evaluation of parasomnias typically involves polysomnography, in some cases with video monitoring, to differentiate parasomnias from other conditions. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including sleep hygiene and sleep safety measures, are first-line approaches. Cognitive behavior therapy is also effective. Pharmacotherapy may be required in severe cases. Referral to a sleep specialist is recommended for patients with complex or dangerous parasomnias and for patients with frequent sleep paralysis.",

      "title": "Subjective sleep problems in young women suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common disorder that affects nearly 9–72% women across studies.[1–3] Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the more severe form of the PMS and its prevalence ranges between 3% and 30%.[2,4] Sleep problems form an integral part of the problem as they are included in the diagnostic criteria for PMDD.[5] A number of studies have tried to find association between PMS or PMDD with sleep pattern and quality of sleep in the past. Sleep was examined using subjective as well as objective measures.[6–10] Majority of the studies have recorded sleep using a polysomnograph across various phases of menstrual cycle.[6–10] However, many of the patients experience first-night effect while sleeping in a sleep laboratory and this may adversely affect polysomnographic data.[11,12] Subjective perception of sleep-related parameters may not match the objective data, and resultantly the patient often complains of subjectively poor-quality sleep despite a good sleep on polysomnograph.[13] The common example is the paradoxical insomnia. Subjective perception of sleep which affects the clinical picture to a greater extent was examined by only a handful of these studies.[6,10] Though as scientists we rely more on objective evidences, still the subjective parameters cannot be overlooked as they are stronger determinants of quality of life. Hence, the present study was planned to assess subjective sleep problems in PMDD subjects and to compare them with the non-PMDD group. We further hypothesized that subjective sleep parameters would also affect the daytime functioning.\r\n\r\nThis questionnaire-based study was done in a nursing college after seeking approval of the institutional ethics committee and permission of college administration. All the female students were invited to participate in the study.\r\n\r\nFemale teachers who took the responsibility to get the questionnaires filled were explained the purpose of the study beforehand. They were also explained what kind of information was intended from each question in a training session. The questionnaire was distributed among the girls with the help of female teachers. Hence, the authors were blinded regarding the identity of participants. This blinding helped to motivate the participants. Teachers then explained the purpose of study to all students and encouraged them to volunteer the information.\r\n\r\nVerbal informed consent was taken from the participants and those who were not interested in participating in the study were excluded. The girls who were taking any kind of psychotropic drug or hormonal therapy were also advised not to participate in this study.\r\n\r\nThe survey questionnaire was designed in Hindi language. It contained instructions regarding intended information. First part of the questionnaire contained instructions and the exclusion criteria as mentioned above. The next part contained questions regarding participants’ demographic data and changes observed in their sleep patterns prior to 1 week of onset of menstruation as compared to other days of the month during past 3 months. These questions included: “change in total sleep time” (responses were increased, as usual, decreased); “time to bed” (advanced, as usual, or delayed); “quality of sleep” (poor, as usual, better); etc. Subjects were supposed to choose the response that best described their condition.\r\n\r\nScreening for the PMDD was based upon DSM-IV-TR criteria.[5] The question was as follows: “Did you notice any change in your mood (depressed, as usual, better) 1 week prior to onset of your menstruation as compared to other days of the month?”. Similar questions were asked regarding other symptoms e.g. irritability (increased, as usual, worse); ability to concentrate (better, as usual, poor) etc.” In this manner, all the 11 criteria mentioned in DSM-IV-TR were changed in the question form. Subjects responded by marking the option that best explained their condition on that item. As per the DSM-IV-TR criteria, subjects who fulfilled 5 of the 11 criteria with at least 1 from the first 4 criteria during past 3 months were considered PMDD. However, DSM requires prospective charting of symptoms for the diagnosis of PMDD; hence, these cases were termed as possible-PMDD.\r\n\r\nStudents were provided explanation if they had any difficulty in understanding the meaning of any of the items. The questionnaires were then collected and analyzed.\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis was done with the help of SPSS version 17.0. Cohort was divided into two groups – those with PMDD and those not fulfilling the criteria of PMDD. Chi-square test was used to compare non-parametric variables.\r\n\r\nThe study sample consisted of 269 subjects. The average age of students was 19.06 years (±1.56 years). 37.5% students met the criteria for possible-PMDD.\r\n\r\nPossible-PMDD subjects reported that their sleep quality was worse before the onset of their menstruation, as compared to subjects who did not fulfill the criteria for PMDD. Table 1 depicts the other details of sleep-related variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nComparison of sleep-related variables between possible-PMDD and no PMDD groups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo difference was reported in dream frequency between these groups. However, emotions associated with dreams were reported to differ between the two groups. Possible-PMDD group reported higher frequency of anxiety and anger in their dreams, as compared to the other group (χ2 = 24.93, df = 3, P < 0.001). However, no difference was observed in the frequency of parasomnia (sleep talking, sleepwalking) and snoring between these groups.\r\n\r\nPossible-PMDD group complained of fatigue during the day (χ2 = 36.68, df = 3, P < 0.001) and daytime sleepiness (χ2 = 18.16, df = 3, P < 0.001).\r\n\r\nOur study found that possible-PMDD group had poor sleep as compared to non-PMDD group on several measures of sleep including bed time, sleep quality, sleep-onset latency, sleep maintenance, and wake time. Similarly, daytime fatigue and daytime sleepiness was also reported by possible-PMDD group. This is in concordance with the results of earlier studies. Mauri et al.[10] have reported that women with severe PMS complain of increased sleepiness and fatigue before menstruation as compared to other periods of their own menstrual cycle as well as with reference to the control group. An increase in daytime sleepiness was the only factor that was able to differentiate between women with and without PMS in another study.[14] Severe PMS has been known to worsen the sleep quality, increase the daytime sleepiness, and is associated with reduced alertness during the day.[9] Thus, these studies reported that the fatigue, sleepiness, and alertness during the day may be used to differentiate PMDD group from non-PMDD group. However, unlike the present study, these studies failed to find any difference in nocturnal sleep. This association between PMS and disturbed subjective sleep parameters (increased nocturnal awakenings, unpleasant dreams, delayed wake time, and morning tiredness) was reported by only one study which was conducted long back.[10] As the quest for the objectivity has increased, most of the work in this area during past decade was done using objective parameters, which may not find any difference despite subjective symptoms.[15] Thus, as a clinician, it is important to consider patients’ symptoms rather than just look for the laboratory reports. Further, as a scientist, these results promote us to search for the factors that are responsible for the difference between subjective and objective quality of sleep in this specialized group.\r\n\r\nWe also found an increased frequency of daytime symptoms in possible–PMDD group, which could have been an influence of nocturnal sleep. Considering the example of paradoxical insomnia, in future, it will be interesting to examine the relationship between PMDD, subjective sleep quality, objective sleep parameters, and daytime symptoms. This may guide us in the management of PMDD.\r\n\r\nWe would like to mention that in this study, subjects without possible PMDD also reported sleep problems. This suggests that sleep problems are not governed by PMDD; rather, they are related to menstrual cycle. In the past, one study reported that poor sleep quality was seen not only in PMDD group but also among non-PMDD women; however; other factors remained unaffected.[6] Manber et al.[14] also reported that sleep disturbance, e.g. increased sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and poor sleep quality, was not limited to PMS group; rather, it was found in all women before menstruation. One reason for these results could be fluctuation in plasma melatonin level and sleep–wake rhythms across menstrual cycle, even in healthy females.[7] These evidences suggest that poor sleep could be a trait marker of premenstrual period rather than a state marker of PMS or PMDD. In other words, sleep changes may be an inherent property of menstrual cycle and PMDD sufferers could have an exaggeration of sleep-related problems during late luteal phase. Like any other study, this study also had some methodological limitations. First, it was a survey and questionnaire can be used to screen only. Secondly, surveys are always associated with recall bias. Thirdly, DSM-IV-TR suggests that PMDD should be diagnosed prospectively, which was not done in the present study. Nonetheless, this study shows important findings in this area and is probably the first Indian study to address this important but yet unrecognized issue. In addition, this study adds up to the scarcely available literature that has examined subjective sleep parameters in PMDD subjects.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, possible-PMDD sufferers have problems with their night sleep and also bear daytime symptoms. These symptoms negatively affect their ability to accomplish daily chores.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of rhabdomyolysis related to correction of hyponatremia secondary to psychogenic polydipsia, possibly complicated by the use of ziprasidone. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old white man treated for 3 weeks with ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily for chronic paranoid schizophrenia was admitted to the intensive care unit after a witnessed generalized seizure. Marked hypotonic hyponatremia was present secondary to psychogenic polydipsia. After correction of hyponatremia with intravenous NaCl 0.9%, he developed a substantial elevation in the creatine kinase level without any evidence of muscle trauma, stiffness, or swelling or any signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Renal failure or compartment syndrome did not complicate the clinical picture. DISCUSSION: It is well known that severe hyponatremia can cause neurologic complications such as stupor, seizures, and even coma. Hyponatremia from water intoxication (n = 28) and its correction with intravenous fluids (n = 2) may cause non-neurologic complications such as rhabdomyolysis. An explanation may lie within the calcium–sodium exchange mechanism across the skeletal myocyte or the failure of cell volume regulation secondary to extracellular hypo-osmolality. Neuroleptic medications have been linked to the development of rhabdomyolysis, with antipsychotics being the primary offenders. As of August 2005, there has been only one reported case of rhabdomyolysis related to correction of hyponatremia complicated by an atypical antipsychotic (clozapine). It is possible that ziprasidone, like clozapine, may enhance muscle cell permeability leading to rhabdomyolysis under similar conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric patients treated with atypical antipsychotic medications should be closely monitored for rhabdomyolysis during correction of hyponatremia, thus permitting prompt therapy to limit its complications.",

      "title": "Sleeping through the Ages: An Examination of Sleep in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "It is widely recognized that sleep disorders (SD) are highly prevalent, despite being under diagnosed and under treated in practice. SDs occurs at all ages, although presentation and subsequent consequences for an individual's health varies throughout the lifespan. Currently, evaluation of SDs are inadequate across all age ranges, and for both sexes, as they are compromised by under reporting and relying on self-report, rather than professional sleep studies (i.e., nocturnal polysomnography (NPS) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT)). Moreover, there is a paucity of data specific to the elderly; many older individuals report dissatisfaction with quality of sleep. Indeed, literature has shown that geriatric populations spend less time in slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and have more difficulties maintaining sleep. Their dissatisfaction may occur from changes in sleep architecture associated with the aging process; however, it has been suggested that it largely stems from comorbid illness, social problems, hormonal effects, altered circadian rhythms, or side effects of medications that are common in the elderly. Further, geriatric sleep is related to depression, impaired health and functioning, and weaker/ less synchronized circadian rhythms. In response, we utilized a 111-item questionnaire in conjunction with NPS, MSLT, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and medical chart reviews of individuals referred for SD evaluation to compare sleep in geriatrics with adults. Analysis revealed numerous differences between adult and geriatric groups, with the elderly experiencing more SDs, longer sleep latencies, and fewer sleep complaints. Based on the outcomes of this investigation, we posit further consideration to SDs across the age groups to achieve the best health care and quality of life for all.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "abstract": "Disruption of sleep causes adverse health outcomes and poor quality of life. People with sleep disruption have higher levels than people without disrupted sleep of depression and anxiety and increased rates of cardiovascular diseases. Women have a higher incidence than men of insomnia and depression related to poor sleep. The types of complaints differ significantly between the sexes. Women are more likely than men to complain of insomnia, headache, irritability, and fatigue than the \"typical\" symptoms of loud snoring and breathing cessation during sleep. Hormones play an important role in sleep in women. Reproductive hormones were found to have a protective effect on sleep apnea in women of premenopausal age. Pregnancy is another period when the prevalence of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome increases from hormonal effect. Cardiovascular mortality is high in women with obstructive sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improves outcomes in most cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and therapies for the three most common sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome), along with effects of menopause, pregnancy, and social factors on sleep in women, are key considerations for clinicians caring for female patients across the adult life span.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a disorder that involves various conditions during sleep, causing negative physiological consequences. SDB refers to multiple diagnoses, including snoring, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA), sleep hypoxia, and sleep-related hypoventilation. The most prevalent among SDB is OSA, affecting almost 1 billion people globally. While sleep apnea can develop in any individual, risk factors associated with increased risk include: obesity, age, male sex, family history, and use of alcohol and sedatives. Upper airway obstruction in OSA can lead to different physiological changes, including decreased oxygen saturation, sleep fragmentation, and changes in heart rate. Long-term consequences include daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life, hypertension, and increased rates of cardiometabolic disorders. Significant presenting symptoms include snoring, poor sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. The diagnosis of sleep apnea requires a comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed sleep history and physical examination. Objective testing is needed for diagnosis and can be done at home or in a sleep laboratory. Different treatment options for sleep apnea include lifestyle change modifications, positive airway pressure (PAP), oral appliances, or surgery.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "title": "Sleep-wake abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis",
      "abstract": "A considerable proportion of patients with cirrhosis exhibit insomnia, delayed sleep habits, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep-wake history, thus the need to sleep increases with the duration of the waking period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-hour rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show delays in the 24-hour melatonin rhythm, most likely in relation to reduced sensitivity to light cues. However, while melatonin abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not seem to offer a comprehensive explanation to the insomnia exhibited by these patients. Fewer data are available on homeostatic sleep control: it has been recently hypothesized that patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy might be unable, due to excessive daytime sleepiness, to accumulate the need/ability to produce restorative sleep. This review will describe in some detail the features of sleep-wake disturbances in patients with cirrhosis, their mutual relationships, and those, if any, with hepatic failure/hepatic encephalopathy. A separate section will cover the available information on their pathophysiology. Finally, etiological treatment will be briefly discussed.",

Sensations often involve both legs but can be unilateral or may alternate between lower extremities. Common complaints include a sensation of creeping, crawling, tingling, wormy, throbbing, pulling, burning, or increased “tension” located deep within the legs (rather than affecting the skin superficially) when sitting or lying down. Some patients are simply unable to describe adequately the sensation they feel. Although symptoms are typically not described as painful, a complaint of pain does not exclude the diagnosis. These uncomfortable sensations extend from the feet and ankle proximally to the legs and, occasionally, thighs. Similar sensations have also been described in the arms. Symptoms tend to occur at night, although unpleasant sensations may emerge during the daytime during prolonged periods of immobility (eg, airplane flights). There is often an accompanying irresistible urge to move the limbs (motor restlessness) to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Less frequently, an isolated urge to move is present without any accompanying unpleasant sensations.",

Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.",

Epidemiological papers on sleep disorders show that a large number of people complain of sleep disorders. Today, there are several classifications and definitions for sleep disorders, and first of all for insomnia. Insufficient sleep can contribute to the occurrence of rapid fatigue during the daytime, reduced activity, attention and efficiency. Studies have shown that long-term and severe sleep disorders can lead to and/or exacerbate various somatic, neurological and mental diseases. Insomnia can contribute to cognitive impairment. Although both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available, drugs are more often prescribed due to greater availability. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first line treatment for adults of any age. Pharmacological intervention may be offered, if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not enough effective or not available. At the same time, the pharmacotherapy for sleep disorders remains problematic despite a large number of sleeping pills. Sleeping agents that are widely used in medical practice both in terms of their mechanisms of action and final results such as their effect on sleep do not always contribute to the development of natural (or at least close to physiological) sleep. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin, and phytotherapeutic medicines can be used to treat insomnia.",

Although any region of the head may be affected, the parietal area is the common localization of nummular headache. The pain remains confined to the same symptomatic area which does not change in shape or size with time. The pain is continuous but lancinating exacerbations lasting for several seconds or gradually increasing from 10 mins to 2 h may superimpose the baseline pain. The temporal pattern is either chronic or remitting. Pseudoremissions may be observed when the pain reaches a very low grade or only discomfort (not pain) in the affected area is reported. At times, discomfort may prevail. Either during symptomatic periods or interictally, the affected area may show a variable combination of hypoethesia, dysesthesia, paresthesia or tenderness. Physical and supplementary examinations are normal. Nummular headache emerges as a primary clear-cut clinical picture. The particular topography and signs of sensory dysfunction make it reasonable to vent the idea that nummular headache is an extracranial headache, probably stemming from epicranial tissues such as terminal branches of sensitive nerves. Nummular headache may seem to be the paradigm of epicranias (group of headaches and pericranial neuralgias stemming from epicranial tissues). Nummular headache must be distinguished from head pain secondary to local processes and from tender points of more extensive headaches. Although nummular headache may frequently coexist with other primary headaches, it has an independent course. Treatment is seldom necessary and in most cases simple reassurance is sufficient.",

Primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger persons. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem. Formal sleep studies may be needed when a primary sleep disorder is suspected or marked daytime dysfunction is noted. Therapy with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be indicated after careful evaluation.",

      "title": "THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH MELATONIN",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Fifteen children (most of whom were neurologically multiply disabled) with severe, chronic sleep disorders were treated with 2 10 10mg of oral melatonin, given at bedtime. Nine had fragmented sleep patterns, three had delayed sleep onset and three others had non‐specific sleep disturbance of unclear aetiology; all had failed to respond to conventional management. Nine patients had ocular or cortical visual impairment. The health, behavioural and social benefits of treatment were significant, and there were no adverse side‐effects. While the response was not always complete, the study clearly showed that melatonin has an important role in the treatment of certain types of chronic sleep disorders. RÉSUMÉ La traitemenl des troubles du sommeil par la mélatonine Quinze enfants (la plupart d'entre eux présentant des incapacités neurologiques multiples) avec des troubles du sommeil sévères et chroniques, fürent traités par 2 à 10mg de mélatonine orale, administrés au moment du coucher. Neuf enfants présentaient une allure fragmentée du sommeil, trois avaient un début de sommeil retardé et les trois autres présentaient des troubles du sommeil non spécifiques et d'origine inconnue: l'échec du traitement conventionnel était manifeste dans tous les cas. Neuf patients présentaient des troubles visuels ou cortico‐visuels. Les bénéfices du traitement sur la santé, le comportement et la relation sociale fürent significatifs et il n'y ey pas d'effets secondaires désagréables. Bien que réponse au traitement n'ait pas été toujours complète, l'étude montre clairement que la mélatonine a un rôle important à jouer dans le traitement de certains types de troubles chroniques du sommeil. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Behandlung von Schlafstörungen mil Melatonin . 15 Kinder (die meisten hatten multiple neurologische Störungen) mil schweren chronischen Schlafstörungen wurden mit 2‐10mg Melatonin oral vor dem Schlafengehen behandelt. Neun hatten fragmentierte Schlafmuster, drei hatten Einschlefstörungen und drei weitere hatten unspezifische Schlaftstörungen unklarer Atiologie; bei alien waren die üblichen Behandlungsmethoden erfolglos geblieben. Neun Patienten hatten okuläre oder corticale visuelle Störungen. Der Nutzen der Behandlung für Gesundheit, Verhalten und für den sozialen Bereich war signifikant und es wurden keine negativen Nebenwirkungen beobachtet. Wenn auch nicht immer eine hundertprozentige Wirkung erzielt wurde, so konnte die Studie doch eindeutig zeigen, daß Melatonin für die Behandlung bestimmter Formen der chronischen Schlafstörungen eine wichtige Rolle spielt. RESUMEN Tratamiento de las alteraciones del sueho con melatonina Quince niños (la mayoria de los cuales tenían múltiples incapacidades neurológicas), con alteraciones del sueño graves y crónicas fueron tratados con 2 a 10mg de melatonina oral al acostarse. Nueve tenian un patrón de sueño fragmentado, tres tenian un inicio del sueño retardo y otros dos tenian alteraciones del sueño no especificas de etiologia no clara; todos habían fracasado a tratamientos convencionales. Nueve pacientes tenian alteraciones visuales oculares o corticales. Los beneficios del tratamiento sobre la salud, comportamiento y factores sociales fueron significativos y no hubo efectos secundarios. Si bien la respuesta no siempre era completa, el estudio mostró claramente que la melatonina tiene un papel importante en el tratamiento de ciertas formas de alteraciones crónicas del sueño.",

      "title": "1183 Chasing Sleep: Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder - Free-Running Type",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, free-running type (CRSD-FRT) is a disorder caused by a circadian pacemaker that is out of sync with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. CRSD-FRT is rare in sighted persons but prevalent in totally blind individuals. In sighted people, CRSD-FRT can be associated with psychiatric conditions such as depression, but the etiology remains unknown. It is postulated that sighted persons may have reduced light sensitivity for phase-resetting effects. Symptoms of CRSD-FRT include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and functional impairment. Here we present a unique case of CRSD-FRT in a sighted female with a history of depression. Report of case(s) A 27-year-old sighted female with history of depression previously treated with an SSRI presented to the sleep clinic with a chief complaint of chronic insomnia. Historically, she went to bed at 3 A.M. and awoke at 2 P.M. Sleep onset latency was normal. Estimated total sleep time was 10 hours. She denied history of any other sleep disorders. She experienced a similar delayed sleep routine as a teenager and assumed it was due to late-night gaming. She tried multiple sleep aids including trazodone, melatonin, and diphenhydramine, unsuccessfully. She described a “normal” sleeping schedule once per month, but then her sleep schedule began to move later and later, until it was normal again. She worked from home and was self-employed, giving her flexibility over her schedule. Her Epworth Sleepiness Score was 13 at the initial visit. Interestingly, her sibling had a similar sleeping pattern. Actigraphy was done which confirmed patient’s diagnosis of CRSD-FRT. She was advised to start Tasimelteon. Conclusion The patient was previously misdiagnosed with insomnia. CRSD-FRT is rare in sighted persons and may be underdiagnosed. Our patient’s CRSD-FRT may be linked to her history of depression and SSRI use. According to one study, a clinical dose of SSRI resulted in 47% increase in melatonin suppression, which increases the human circadian system’s responsiveness to light. Her flexible work from home schedule may also be a contributing factor. When changing or eliminating social time cues could precipitate the development of CRSD-FRT due to variations in the length of circadian rhythm. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute psychotic states characterized by clinical lability and dream-like qualities are a staple of classic psychopatology. An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Insomnia associated with medical disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

The current study is a retrospective review of the sleep diagnosis in 300 consecutive children seen and evaluated in a single sleep disorders centre; 252 children underwent polysomnography, as clinically indicated, to identify the proper diagnosis. The current research estimates the prevalence of RSD in a sleep clinical setting to be 7.7% and compares it to the prevalence of other common sleep disorders in the same setting.

With the aid of video-polysomnographic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, sleep-related movements can be directly observed. Movements can be described based on duration, amplitude, periodicity, and most importantly their predilection to disturb sleep or produce other undesirable consequences. Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) constitute a class of movements that are simple and usually stereotyped, and are associated with undesirable effects such as impaired sleep quantity or quality, and/or impairment in daytime functioning. Unlike parasomnias, they are not associated with sleep-related mentation and are not goaldirected. They may occur during the transition between sleep and waking, and vice versa, or during any sleep stages.",

Treatment included introduction of strict sleep habits and strengthening of environmental \"zeitgebers\". After five months melatonin 3 mg was administered at night for 4 weeks. The observation period also included 3 weeks without melatonin. Sleep was registered prospectively by a sleep diary. Strict sleep habits combined with strengthening of \"zeitgebers\" partially improved the sleep problems, but did not establish a normal sleep pattern. When melatonin was added, he normalized his sleep pattern in a few days. His sleep problems returned during the weeks in which he did not receive melatonin. No side effects were observed.Melatonin is a promising treatment alternative for serious sleep problems in blind children.",

      "abstract": "Behavioural advice forms the starting point for the treatment of all central disorders of hypersomnolence. It is also increasingly recognised that the narcolepsy phenotype is broad, including symptoms such as metabolic disturbances potentially fuelling obesity, eating disorders, depression and anxiety. Cataplexy is the most specific symptom of narcolepsy and in combination with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) virtually pathognomonic for Narcolepsy type 1. Besides improving night-time sleep quality, probably by enhancing the slow wave component, sodium oxybate is also very efficacious for cataplexy. Hypnagogic hallucinations are realistic dream-like experiences around sleep onset whereas the term 'hypnopompic' is used if they occur from awakening. Sleep paralysis can occur during arousals from sleep or, typically for narcolepsy, at sleep onset. Pharmacotherapy for sleepiness should be tailored towards the individual patient. For most patients, modafinil is a first-line agent, especially as it provides a background level of increased alertness and has relatively few side effects.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician, insomnia is a symptom which is difficult to understand as it is a predominantly subjective variable: in clinical practice, it is the patient's complaint which guides the doctor in his diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "title": "Clinical Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, with a prevalence of around 20%. The clearest risk factors are female gender and the presence of a psychiatric or medical disorder. The most important conceptual change in our understanding of insomnia, defined in the National Institutes of Health 2005 consensus conference, is that insomnia is a disorder itself rather than a symptom of another disorder. Specifically, insomnia is a disorder of hyperarousal. Insomniacs do not have an abnormal sleep homeostat or circadian system but rather an overactivated wake system. Cognitively, patients often complain they cannot “shut [their] brain down.” Physiologic correlates include elevated brain metabolism, increased fast electroencephalographic activity, and increased autonomic, metabolic, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Treatment for insomnia can be divided into two categories, behavioral and pharmacologic. Another important categorization relates to self-treatment (sleep hygiene and over-the-counter drugs) versus clinician-directed therapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-I] and prescribed hypnotics). Among behavioral treatments are sleep restriction, stimulus control, relaxation training, and cognitive therapy. The most widely used behavioral therapy is a combination of the four treatment components referred to collectively as CBT-I. The majority of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hypnotics are drugs that occupy the benzodiazepine receptor site, which is part of the GABAA receptor complex. The hypnotic efficacy of the FDA-approved benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) has been well documented using objective polysomnography and subjective measures of sleep induction and duration. Many BzRA side effects are associated with the desired sedative effects of the drug and relate to the pharmacokinetics, receptor subtype affinities, and dose of the drug.

      "title": "Thyroid psychosis: when your hormones take over your mind: a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Hyperthyroidism, characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones, is a common endocrine disorder that affects various body systems. While most commonly recognized for its classic symptoms such as weight loss, tremors, and palpitations, it is important to acknowledge that hyperthyroidism can also lead to a rare but significant complication: psychosis. Psychosis in the context of hyperthyroidism refers to the presence of delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking, which can significantly impact an individual’s mental health and overall well-being. Objectives This case report aims to describe a rare case of hyperthyroidism-related psychosis in a patient including the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management. Additionally, we aim to increase awareness of and promote further research into this condition. Methods We present a comprehensive case report detailing the clinical course of a 29-year-old male patient with no previous medical or psychiatric history, who sought urgent psychiatric evaluation at the Razi Hospital La Manouba’s emergency department due to escalating symptoms of agitation and paranoia persisting for three days. The patient, identified as Mr. S.O., a Tunisian male, presented with severe agitation and paranoia necessitating the use of restraints upon admission to the psychiatric emergency department. The initial physical examination revealed no notable abnormalities, except for the presence of tachycardia, which was subsequently confirmed on an electrocardiogram, arousing suspicion of a primary psychiatric illness. Results While the standard blood workup yielded unremarkable findings, the endocrine workup revealed decreased levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and elevated free thyroxine (FT4). Further laboratory investigations demonstrated elevated anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, leading to the diagnosis of Graves’ disease. Collaborative consultation with an endocrinologist resulted in the initiation of a treatment regimen consisting of methimazole, propranolol, and risperidone. Notably, within three days of the initiated therapy, the patient exhibited significant improvement in terms of reduced agitation, coherent speech, and the development of self-reflection regarding the episode, ultimately leading to his discharge on the seventh day of hospitalization. This case report serves to highlight the complexity of psychiatric presentations associated with underlying endocrine disorders and underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving optimal patient outcomes. Conclusions While mental health factors play a significant role in the development of psychosis, it is essential to recognize that underlying medical conditions may also contribute to its onset or exacerbation.

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal.

      "title": "Impact of nocturia on sleep and quality of life: A brief, selected review for the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI‐RS) nocturia think tank",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, the need to awaken at night to void, is a highly prevalent disorder that negatively affects nocturnal sleep, increases daytime tiredness, and adversely impacts quality of life. In this selective review, we provide the reader an overview of current work in this area. From the perspective of disturbed sleep, two divergent perspectives have emerged from the literature when discussing nocturia. The first is that a patient awakens because of an urge to urinate. The second is that a patient awakens during the night for some reason unrelated to urinary urge (e.g., an awakening from an environmental source or from intrinsic lightening of sleep) and then decides to void while awake. In the few studies that have inquired about nocturia as a cause of awakenings, nocturia often ranks above the traditional psychological or physical factors. Not only is nocturia likely to disrupt sleep, but it may impact waking quality of life as well. A number of generic and nocturia‐related questionnaires have been used to quantify the effect of nocturia on quality of life. In this short paper, we introduce the reader to several key studies in these important areas. Neurourol. Urodynam. 33:S15–S18, 2014 . © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Patients with stroke were significantly sleepier during the daytime relative to the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease patients. Nocturnal sleep parameters did not account for these differences. In the stroke patients, some infarcts occurred in the vasculature, impacting blood supply to the hypothalamus.

      "title": "Sleep polysomnography as a predictor of recurrence in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrate certain sleep polysomnographic abnormalities, including sleep continuity disturbances, reduced slow-wave sleep, shortened rapid eye movement (REM) latency, and increased REM density. Findings of sleep EEG studies in depressed children and adolescents have yielded conflicting results, possibly because of methodological variations across the studies. Generally, however, studies have demonstrated that depressed children and adolescents exhibit less sleep continuity and non-REM sleep differences in comparison with control subjects than do adults. Thus, results from adult sleep polysomnography studies cannot necessarily be generalized to children and adolescents. Depressed adults who have reduced REM latency during the symptomatic episode appear more likely to have a relapse once treatment is discontinued than those with normal REM latency. No studies of the relationship between sleep polysomnographic variables and clinical course have been reported in depressed children and adolescents. Data for baseline clinical variables and 3 nights of sleep polysomnography were examined in 113 depressed children (≤ 12 yr; n = 51) and adolescents (≥ 13 yr; n = 62) (56 in-patients and 57 outpatients) where data was available on at least 1 yr of naturalistic follow-up. Subjects came from 2 studies of sleep polysomnography in children and adolescents with MDD. Clinical course was assessed using the Kiddie-Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation (K-LIFE). This interview was used to define recovery from the index episode of MDD and recurrence, a new episode of meeting full criteria for MDD. Clinically, within 1 yr of initial evaluation 102/113 subjects had recovered from their index episode of depression (minimal or no symptoms for 60 d). Of the 102 subjects who recovered, 36 (35.3%) had a recurrence of MDD. The majority of subjects (55%) who had a recurrence were not on medication at the time of recurrence. Subjects who had a recurrence were more likely to report suicidal thoughts or attempts at baseline compared to those without a recurrence (67 vs. 37%; F = 8.77; p = 0.004). On baseline sleep polysomnography, subjects with a later recurrence had decreased sleep efficiency and delayed sleep onset (sleep latency > 10 min). Probability of recurrence at 12 months was 0.39 compared to 0.15 in subjects with non-delayed sleep onset (p = 0.005). Baseline suicidal ideation and sleep dysregulation on sleep polysomnography predicted recurrence in a large sample of depressed children and adolescents. Depression in children and adolescents is frequently a chronic, recurrent illness. Factors that can predict clinical course are important in increasing our understanding of depression in this age group.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

A fact less well-recognized by clinicians and the general public is that sleep-related breathing disorders, which occur in two to ten percent of children depending on how they are defined, can have a significant impact even among children who have normal sleep duration [4]. Snoring is a hallmark symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, and enlarged tonsils are often a contributing factor to the breathing disturbance. We still do not fully understand the mechanism that links snoring or enlarged tonsils with behavioral problems and poor grades.\r\n\r\nOne of the more severe nocturnal breathing disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), involves partial or complete breathing blockage recurrently during sleep, resulting in intermittent drops in blood oxygen levels and probable sleep disruption. Although brain processes are presumed to mediate the link between these medical factors and daytime behavioral and scholastic problems, our understanding of these processes remains fairly theoretical and speculative. The frontal and hippocampal regions of the brain, which are implicated in the regulation of behavior and memory, respectively, appear to be most vulnerable to OSA [4], but the evidence is indirect.\r\n\r\nIn a new study published in PLoS Medicine, Ann Halbower and colleagues [5] used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can detect chemical metabolites linked to neural dysfunction, to shed more direct light on the neural functioning of children with OSA.",

      "title": "1450 Trauma-Associated Sleep Disorder with Dream Enactment Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Trauma-associated sleep disorder (TASD) is a proposed parasomnia that, while sharing criteria with REM-behavior disorder (RBD) remains under-recognized by clinicians. It is more common in the veteran population, and lacks clear guidelines on treatment, especially when accompanied by dream enactment behavior. Report of case A 67 year-old Gulf War veteran presented to sleep clinic with over 30 years of frequent dream enactment behavior (DEB). He has a concurrent history of insomnia, depression, and PTSD. Military service lasted 23 years, with active combat 1990-1991. DEB started then, as frequently as 5-7 times weekly. Behaviors include throwing nearby items, jumping out of bed, crawling on the floor, swinging, and yelling. The patient can only intermittently recall corresponding dreams. He has no tremor, shuffling gait, or change in handwriting. Neurological exam showed no cogwheel rigidity or resting tremor. He was diagnosed with trauma-associated sleep disorder and started on melatonin in 2017. Even with doses up to 15 mg there was no effect on parasomnia frequency or intensity, or any effect on sleep length or latency. He tried prazosin and doxazosin without improvement. These were stopped for side effects. Nighttime nausea and dizziness from other medication prevented starting clonazepam. He was later started on amitriptyline, which helped with sleep onset, but did not affect parasomnia. The patient is averse to group therapy because hearing others’ trauma has previously made his nightmares worse. The planned treatment is 1-on-1 image rehearsal therapy. Conclusion TASD with DEB is a parasomnia not discussedin the ICSD-3-TR. Proposed mechanisms include hyperactivity in the locus coeruleus and peri-LC structures, as seen in PTSD, chronic stress, and psychiatric medications. TASD features nightmares that can occur in REM and NREM sleep and should be considered in any veteran with dream enactment. IRT is a non-pharmacologic treatment for PTSD-associated nightmares, but its effect on DEB is unclear, with only case reports. This patient has a decades-long history of DEB, but no signs of other neurological illnesses. The risk of evolution to true RBD and of developing alpha-synucleinopathies in these patients need to be clarified. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "The major physiological consequences of sleep apnea include (excessive) daytime sleepiness and effects on the cardiovascular system. Daytime sleepiness is a typical complaint of sleep apnea patients and has generally been thought to result from the repeated arousals during nighttime sleep that are necessary to breathe, i.e., nighttime sleep of apneic patients is fragmented and not refreshing. Although the daytime sleepiness can occur at any time of the day, it most commonly occurs during the afternoon or early evening. The observation that naps do not usually provide relief from feelings of daytime sleepiness suggests that factors other than nighttime sleep fragmentation may be involved. In this chapter, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review data indicating that cytokines are involved in sleep regulation. We then present evidence that some effects of sleep apnea may include alterations in cytokine proﬁles. Finally, we conclude by speculating that alterations in cytokine concentrations/proﬁles may be one of several causal factors of the daytime sleepiness typically associated with sleep apnea.",

      "title": "Volatile Anesthesia Does Not Satisfy Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Debt",
      "abstract": "A common statement made to patients before they undergo a general anesthetic is, \"We will watch you very carefully while you are asleep.\" The relationship between states of sleep and anesthesia raises clinically relevant questions. For example, sleep deprivation enhances pain, worsens obstructive sleep apnea, impairs immune function, and contributes to cognitive decline.1If a patient is sleep deprived, and if anesthesia is similar to sleep, will the sleep debt be diminished by anesthesia? In addition to being homeostatically regulated, mammalian sleep occurs with a prominent circadian rhythm. If a general anesthetic is administered during a patient's normal sleep time, will the patient be less sleepy after the anesthetic, as if he had maintained his normal sleep cycle?\"If a patient is sleep deprived, and if anesthesia is similar to sleep, will the sleep debt be diminished by anesthesia?\"In a report published this month by Pick et al. ,2the authors demonstrate that after a 6-h general anesthetic with sevoflurane, isoflurane, or halothane, mice exhibited a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deficit, followed by a REM sleep rebound. The study also reports a nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep debt and rebound only after halothane. Pick et al. used an ingenious experimental design that made it possible to evaluate the effects of time, light-dark cycle, type, and duration of anesthetic agent on states of wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM. Their results documented significant main effects on the temporal organization of sleep and wakefulness caused by both duration and type of anesthetic. Analogous to the oxygen debt of exercise being compensated by an increase in minute ventilation, the Pick et al. results support the interpretation that the ability of volatile anesthetics to satisfy the homeostatic drive for sleep differs as a function of anesthetic agent and the NREM or REM phase of sleep. Pick et al. also raise the intriguing suggestion that the duration of anesthesia or sleep/wake states is monitored by some, as yet unknown, control systems. Their findings imply that the brain stores this information regarding the temporal organization of behavioral states and, after recovery from anesthesia, reactivates neuronal networks that generate the appropriate amount and type of sleep needed to reestablish homeostatic balance.States of sleep are different from states of anesthesia. Apply a painful stimulus and the individual who is asleep will awaken. One goal of a general anesthetic, of course, is to eliminate responsiveness to external stimuli. During sleep, humans cycle approximately every 90 min between the REM and NREM phases of sleep. During REM sleep, which is characterized by dreaming and skeletal muscle atonia, there are rapid eye movements, increases in brain metabolic and electrical activity, heart and respiratory rate irregularities, erection of the clitoris or penis, and oscillations in a large number of hormones.1In contrast, one of the goals of balanced anesthesia is to maintain prolonged intervals of stable autonomic function.In this last decade, there has been much progress documenting the similarities and differences between sleep and anesthesia. As recently reviewed,3there is consensus that states of anesthesia, like sleep, are actively generated by multiple brain regions, overlapping networks, and a humbling complexity of neurotransmitters and signal transduction cascades. Studies of sleep and anesthesia benefit from a viable interaction between clinical and basic research. Clinical concerns have led to interesting basic studies. Do patients in an Intensive Care Unit who are sedated for long periods get enough sleep? That question influenced a study in which sleep-deprived rats that received either propofol or isoflurane lost the righting reflex more quickly and also took longer to recover from anesthesia.4Additional studies found that sleep-deprived rats that received propofol showed reversal of both REM and NREM sleep debt.5Interestingly, the Pick et al. data from mice are consistent with recent data obtained from other studies. For example, rats deprived of REM sleep for 24 h that received isoflurane for 4 h had the same amount of REM sleep rebound as rats that were allowed to sleep ad libitum .6When rats were deprived of REM and NREM sleep and administered 6 h of sevoflurane, signs of NREM sleep deprivation were reduced to half the time of rats that did not receive sevoflurane anesthesia. REM sleep debt was not reduced by sevoflurane anesthesia, and sevoflurane induction time was significantly reduced in sleep-deprived rats.7The Pick et al. findings raise an interesting historical point regarding isoflurane. Most anesthesiologists today probably did not practice anesthesia during the early 1980s, when isoflurane was introduced. At that time, excluding enflurane, halothane was the most commonly used anesthetic. Recovery after isoflurane is remarkably fast compared with halothane, in large part because the metabolism of halothane releases bromide. The increase in bromide is related to minimum alveolar concentration hours of exposure, as the rise in bromide approaches sedative concentrations. In an editorial published in this journal in 1976, Nicholas Greene summarized other studies showing elevation of plasma bromide levels after halothane.8He noted that prolonged sedation can be seen after halothane anesthesia and that the peak levels of plasma bromide are in the range that can cause sedation.9The fact that recent studies searching for a relationship between sleep and anesthesia have not included halothane is probably because halothane is no longer used in many countries, including the United States.Going forward, more work is needed on the clinically relevant topic of sleep and anesthesia. The study limitations acknowledged by Pick et al. point to an exciting opportunity for bench-to-bedside investigations designed to document anesthetic effects on human sleep. Most patients who receive anesthesia also have pain on awakening, and sleep is significantly disrupted both by pain and by the use of opioids to treat pain.10The excellent study by Pick et al. encourages future research aiming to elucidate the contributions of pain to the sleep-altering effects of anesthetic molecules.",

One problem with the monoamine hypothesis is that the timing of antidepressant effects on neurotransmitters is generallyfaster (within minutes) than the timing of the antidepressant effects on mood (reaching maximal effect in days to weeks). One theory toexplain the ultimate mechanism of delayed therapeutic action of antidepressants is the \"neurotransmitter receptor hypothesis of antidepressant action,\" which proposes that antidepressants, no matter what their initial actions on receptors and enzymes, eventually cause a desensitization or \"down-regulation\" of key neurotransmitter receptors in a time course consistent with the delayed onset ofantidepressant action of these drugs.",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Asphyxia describes any condition that results in oxygen deprivation and, in the unborn or soon-to-be-born infant, may occur prenatally in utero, during delivery or postnatally [1]. In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

      "abstract": "Case Presentation A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after being found \"unresponsive\" by his parents. He has been in good general health, has had no fever or other symptoms of infectious processes, has been taking no medications, and was \"his normal self\" until immediately prior to being found. Patients who are unresponsive and unarousable are in coma. The term altered consciousness represents the spectrum of abnormalities that exists between the immediate capability for normal wakefulness and true coma. For the purposes of this review, the two terms will be used interchangeably because their causes are similar and usually differ only in severity. Pathophysiology Two areas of the brain are responsible for consciousness: the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and the cerebral cortex. The ARAS is located in the brain stem from the level of the medulla to the level of the midbrain and sends multiple afferent neurons to the cortex. Disruption of this system can lead to disorders of consciousness. The cerebral cortex is the much more common site where dysfunction can cause coma. Any injury or illness that affects the cerebral cortex globally can cause coma or altered consciousness. Differential Diagnosis Altered consciousness in children can be caused by injuries or illnesses that affect the central nervous system directly or can be a manifestation of other systemic disease (Table 1).",

      "title": "Role of add on rTMS in management of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Sir, Insomnia is a major health concern. The interhemispheric connectivity is disrupted in specific brain areas (middle occipital, posterior middle temporal gyrus) without alterations in structural and local morphological changes in patients with chronic insomnia.[1] Studies have found cortical alterations as well as intracortical excitability in patients with insomnia and also among healthy controls with sleep deprivation, using single and paired pulse repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).[23] These neurophysiological changes are amenable to be altered by neuromodulation techniques such as rTMS. We describe here a case of an adult male with predominant insomnia who improved with rTMS. A 49-years-old nondiabetic and nonhypertensive male sought psychiatric consultation for multiple, nonspecific pain symptoms (body ache and burning pain in the eyes) and gastric discomfort (fullness of the abdomen, acid reflux, and epigastric pain). These complaints were associated with anxiety. Premorbidly, he used to have 6–8 h of sleep, but during the course of his illness, the sleep duration had been reduced to <1 h/day. There was no past or family history of psychiatric illness. The patient had never used any psychoactive substance. The patient consulted several physicians and was investigated extensively with no noticeable abnormalities. He had been treated with various antidepressants and benzodiazepines in combination, in the past without much benefit. Due to little improvement in sleep, the patient had overmedicated himself several times in the past. He adopted several lifestyle modifications (regular aerobic exercise, dietary modifications, and practice of yoga), without any noticeable benefit. He was always preoccupied with the thought of having some major physical illness. He was hospitalized for his complaints of persistent sleep disturbance. His general physical examination and systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality. On mental status examination, his mood was anxious and he had illness preoccupation. He was diagnosed with somatoform disorder with chronic tension-type headache with chronic primary insomnia. At the time of hospitalization, the patient was on desvenlafaxine 100 mg/day, trazodone 100 mg/day, zolpidem 10 mg/day, and clonazepam 1 mg/day, with a sleep duration of 2–3 h/day. Due to inadequate response to pharmacotherapy, he was considered for rTMS. After informed consent, he was started with low-frequency rTMS (1 Hz) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of resting motor threshold. We adopted the protocol used in a previous study.[4] At baseline evaluation, his Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score was 16 (poor sleep quality) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score was 19 (clinical insomnia of moderate severity). He was given a total of 15 sessions of rTMS with 1800 pulses per se ssion along with ongoing pharmacotherapy. After 15 days of daily rTMS, he showed a significant improvement in his sleep. His sleep increased to 4–5 h per night and his PSQI and ISI scores became 11 and 10, respectively. His somatic complaints were also resolved completely. He was discharged on desvenlafaxine 100 mg/day, trazodone 100 mg/day, and zolpidem (sustained-release preparation) 12.5 mg/day. In 3-week follow-up, he was well-maintained. There was no medical cause that attributed to the symptoms in our case. The patient's insomnia was refractory to pharmacotherapy, psychological interventions, and lifestyle modification measures. As insomnia was of longer duration (>30 days), unrelated to the course of psychiatric illness and causing significant distress to the individual, the possibility of primary insomnia was more likely. Symptoms of somatoform disorder did not improve completely with conventional pharmacotherapy, which might be due to persisting insomnia. Behavioral interventions focusing on sleep hygiene are the mainstay treatment of chronic insomnia.[5] Pharmacological and psychological interventions are commonly recommended for the treatment of insomnia.[6] Jiang et al. had evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in chronic primary insomnia and found that patients receiving rTMS had a significant improvement in Stage III and rapid eye movement sleep and sleep architecture as well as had fewer relapses and recurrence rates.[4] Considering the refractoriness of insomnia, we considered rTMS for our patient. The patient had shown noticeable benefits to add on rTMS, which remained stable over the next 3 months (till last follow-up). Recent evidence suggests that bilateral sequential low-frequency rTMS was useful in the management of primary insomnia. The therapeutic effect of bilateral sequential low-frequency rTMS is mediated through elevation of levels of neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.[7] The uniqueness in our case was that the patient's somatic symptoms had also improved substantially after 15 sessions of rTMS. This shows the effect of rTMS as an augmenting therapy in nonorganic insomnia patients. Further research is needed to understand the efficacy of rTMS in insomnia management as a stand-alone treatment.

      "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue: Sleep in Children with Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "For those clinicians and researchers who have chosen and embraced the challenges and rewards of working on a daily basis with children and families, the concept of ‘‘developmental context’’ is hardly a revelation. As with virtually any issue that pediatric practitioners confront in clinical settings or investigators examine in experimental settings or epidemiologic studies, sleep problems in childhood must be viewed in the context of normal physical and cognitive/emotional phenomena that are occurring at different developmental stages. For example, temporary regressions in sleep development often accompany the achievement of motor and cognitive milestones in the first year of life. Similarly, an increase in nighttime fears and night wakings in toddlers may be a temporary manifestation of developmentally normal separation anxiety peaking during that stage. In addition, sleep problems in the pediatric population must be viewed against a backdrop of the normal developmental trajectory across childhood and developmental norms; i.e., ‘‘normal’’ bedtime behavior, time to sleep onset, and sleep duration are obviously dramatically different in a 6-month old, 6-year old, and 16-year old. Finally, because the developmental continuum includes the transition into adulthood, insights into the prevalence, types, and impact of, as well as risk and protective factors for, sleep problems in childhood have direct relevance in regards to an increased understanding of sleep issues at all life stages. Despite the obvious importance of viewing sleep problems in both children and adults from a developmental perspective, the body of literature in developmental aspects of pediatric sleep research at this juncture is still relatively sparse. For example, there are surprisingly little large-scale epidemiological data currently available, which systematically define normal sleep and wakefulness patterns and sleep duration in the pediatric population. Most of the existing studies have utilized subjective, parentreport, retrospective, cross-sectional surveys in selected populations. Although cross-sectional studies yield important information regarding sleep in discrete age groups, by their nature they neither describe the evolution and persistence of sleep/wake patterns over time, nor do they help to elucidate the complex reciprocal relationship between sleep and cognitive/emotional development from the prenatal period through adolescence. There are even more limited data from studies utilizing more ‘‘objective’’ methods of measuring sleep quality and duration, such as polysomnography and actigraphy; and many of these studies were conducted prior to the establishment of accepted sleep monitoring and scoring standards. There are many potential reasons for this relative knowledge gap. First, as with many behavioral issues in childhood, the patient is rarely the one who presents with a chief complaint of a sleep problem. Thus, parental concerns and subjective observations regarding their child’s sleep patterns and behaviors often define sleep disturbances in the research, as well as in the clinical context. Parental recognition and reporting of sleep problems in children also varies across childhood, with parents of infants and toddlers more likely to be aware of sleep concerns than those of school-aged children and adolescents (and to report them to clinicians and researchers). Furthermore, the very definition of what behaviors constitute a sleep ‘‘problem’’ is often highly subjective and is frequently determined by the amount of disruption caused to parents’ sleep. Culturally based values and beliefs regarding the meaning, importance, and role of sleep in daily life, as well as culturally based differences in sleep practices (e.g., sleeping space and environment, solitary sleep vs. co-sleeping, use of transitional objects) also have a profound effect on how a parent",

      "abstract": "Insomnia may be categorized as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. The ideal hypnotic must promote rapid sleep onset and maintain sleep throughout the night while allowing the patient to awake refreshed the following day. Several benzodiazepines, with differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are presently available. All are clinically effective and not only elimination half-life but also dosage prescribed and pattern of distribution are important factors for determining treatment response. Hypnotics have been divided into those with long elimination half-lives (e.g. nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam), those with intermediately long half-lives (brotizolam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, temazepam) and those with short half-lives (midazolam and triazolam). Carry-over effects into the morning such as excessive daytime sleepiness or drowsiness are related to drug half-life, dosage and pattern of distribution. In equipotent dosages most controlled clinical trials have found no significant differences between the various benzodiazepine hypnotics. Nevertheless, clinicians in general tend to use long half-life benzodiazepines in patients who have difficulties maintaining sleep and short half-life benzodiazepines for treating sleep onset insomnia. Intermediately long half-life, benzodiazepines are used for both indications and most clinicians feel that the choice of hypnotic should not only be influenced by elimination half-life or the dosage used, but by individual patient preference. Hypnotics should be used for only short periods of time and in those patients for whom a more chronic use is indicated, they should be used only on an intermittent basis.",

This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others.

      "title": "Impaired Mental Proprioception in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychiatrists recognize that schizophrenia is a disorder in which the highest mental functions, such as thought, language, emotions, conation, and cognition, are drastically disrupted. However, the most serious impairment in schizophrenia is a global malfunction in self-integration and personal identity that includes a deficit in self-recognition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

      "title": "The effect of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep of schizophrenic patients",
      "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia commonly report problems related to disturbed sleep, most often presenting as difficulties with sleep onset latency (SOL) or with sleep maintenance, whereas others have identified disrupted circadian sleep control such as phase delay and even free running cycles. Several studies have evaluated objective measures of sleep abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia by means of polysomnographic techniques. While the majority of published reports are associated with substantial methodological problems that confound interpretation of the data presented, some consistent patterns of findings can be observed across a number of studies examining sleep physiology in schizophrenic patients. The most consistently reported findings have included prolonged SOL and increased wake time after sleep onset (WASO). Additionally, some studies reported diminished slow-wave sleep (SWS) time in patients with schizophrenia as compared to healthy controls, and other studies noted short REM latency (REM-L). However, the latter two findings were not as consistently replicated across studies. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating neurobiological mechanisms involved in the regulation of sleep and wake states as well the coordination of transitions within sleep from one state to another (e.g., regulating transitions from non-REM to REM sleep stages). In addition to the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems glutamate and GABA, monoamine neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), acetylcholine (ACh) and histamine have all been demonstrated to play important roles in the sleep state regulation process. Antipsychotic drugs, including both the typical and atypical antipsychotic classes, have all been shown to produce prominent inhibitory effects at DA D2 receptor sites. Additionally, to varying degrees, different antipsychotic drugs produce modulatory effects on 5-HT, NE, ACh and histaminergic receptors, thereby providing a strong rationale for anticipating prominent effects of antipsychotic drugs on sleep physiology when administered to patients with schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders as well as to healthy control subjects. A number of studies have reported data on effects of antipsychotic drugs on sleep measures in patients with psychiatric disorders and in healthy control groups. Many of the published reports are noted to have significant methodological limitations, making interpretation of the findings tenuous in some cases. Nevertheless, some consistent patterns of findings have been reported to date. In general, administration of typical antipsychotic drugs has been noted to result in improved sleep continuity, as characterized by increased total sleep time, increased sleep efficiency and decreased SOL and WASO. In these studies, SWS was generally not altered but REM-L was occasionally increased. In studies examining effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs, generally similar patterns of improvement of sleep continuity measures have been reported across the various agents in this class, but some differences have been noted in terms of effects on SWS and on parameters of REM activity. Differences in effects of various atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep may be explained by their differing pharmacological mechanisms of action. Substantial limitations are noted in terms of the studies of effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep.

      "abstract": "Headaches occurring during sleep are one of the most common types of night time pain complaints, along with back pain. Sleep-related headaches can be a manifestation of both primary headaches (migraine, cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, hypnic headache) and secondary headaches associated with somatic pathology (anemia, hypoxemia), neurological disorders (brain tumors, arteriovenous malformations), psychiatric (depressive, anxiety) and sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea). The relationship between headaches and sleep depends on the patients age, frequency and severity of the headaches, provoking factors (excessive sleep, sleep deprivation, overuse of painkillers), the stage of sleep (REM sleep or slow-wave sleep) and possible genetic predisposition (hemiplegic migraine).&#x0D; The connections between sleep and headaches are complex and interrelated. Sleep can both provoke and relieve headaches. On the other hand, headaches can cause sleep disorders, which are typical for a severe type of cephalgia with the development of chronic daily headache syndrome, medication overuse, and psychiatric comorbidity. General anatomical structures, neurochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in sleep and headache regulation are assumed. According to polysomnography data, objective changes in the structure of night sleep were detected in patients with a sleep-related headache: a reduction in the sleep duration and a decrease in the slow-wave sleep representation. Most nighttime headache attacks are linked with the REM sleep phase.&#x0D; Management of patients with sleep-related headaches should include the diagnosis and treatment of both headache and sleep disorder, which will significantly improve the results of treatment or even cure headaches in some cases.",

Most are of obscure nature while some illustrate features of syncope that deserve further scrutiny. The cases are divided into six groups: 1) Resembling cardiac syncope (30 cases); 2) vasovagal syncope (22 cases); 3) features of both cardiac and vasovagal syncope (12 cases); 4) orthostatic hypotensive (29 cases); 5) akinetic seizure? (12 cases); and 6) miscellaneous (5 cases). Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension.

      "abstract": "Sleep is a reversible state of lack of consciousness and response to the environment that is accompanied by important physiological adjustments. This is subdivided in two behavioral states, REM sleep and non-REM sleep (NREM).There are pathological processes that manifest mainly during sleep. Within these, parasomnias are defined as the pathologies in which undesirable behaviors occur during sleep. The parasomnias are subdivided into those that occur during NREM and REM sleep.Among NREM-parasomnias, somnambulism (sleep-walking) is highlighted, which is characterized by complex motor behavior during sleep, mainly affecting children. Another important parasomnia is the night terror, which is a dramatic event that represents a partial awakening during deep sleep, which is accompanied by an important autonomic activation.Among REM-parasomnias, the most important is REM sleep behavior disorder. This is characterized by the absence of the muscular atony that is characteristic of this behavioral state. This determines that patients act their own dreams (which mainly occur during REM sleep) and can result in injuries of diverse entity. This parasomnia is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.Since sleep disorders in general, and parasomnias in particular, are relatively unknown disorders in our medical system, in this work we made a state of the art of this subject.",

      "abstract": "Ventilation is disturbed in sleep even in healthy individuals. In rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) disburbances in ventilation are coupled to phasic events. In 10 normal subjects respiratory frequency was found to be positively correlated and rib cage motion was inversely correlated with eye movement density during REMS. Abdominal motion was little affected, and hence the adverse effects of phasic events on overall ventilation were limited. Ventilation during non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) is characterized by regular periodicities. 'Itro mechanisms are thought to be involved. First, instability of the chemical feedback system caused by high overall loop gain leads to ventilatory oscillations. Second, removal of the wakefulness stimulus leads to reductions in ventilation at sleep onset. It is likely that these two mechanisms interact to produce periodicities in ventilation during early stage 1-2 NREMS. Ventilation is commonly disturbed in sleep. This both occurs in normal individuals, and is particularly severe in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. The mechanisms underlying this are likely to be different in the different stages of sleep. In rapid eye-movement sleep, the disturbances are coupled to the phasic events that occur in this state. One method to measure these phasic events is by recording rapid eye-movements. We have developed a method to examine the interrelationship between ventilation and its components and eye-movements. This method is based on computing separately a running average of ventilation and its components and eye movement density (number of eye movements/second). The window length of the running average, the degree of overlap between adjacent windows and the delay (or lag) between the ventilation and eye movement measures is adjustable. The latter is to allow for asynchrony between the ventilatory changes and the occurrence of eye movements. We have found that a window length of",

It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952). The condition is familial, apparently being inherited as a simple recessive trait (Riley et al. , 1954), though an irregular dominant is a possibility (St. Martin, 1953).",

      "title": "Persistent hypersomnia following repetitive mild experimental traumatic brain injury: Roles of chronic stress and sex differences",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often more complicated than a single head injury. An extreme example of this point may be military service members who experience a spectrum of exposures over a prolonged period under stressful conditions. Understanding the effects of complex exposures can inform evaluation and care to prevent persistent symptoms. We designed a longitudinal series of non‐invasive procedures in adult mice to evaluate the effects of prolonged mild stress and head injury exposures. We assessed anxiety, depression, and sleep–wake dysfunction as symptoms that impact long‐term outcomes after mild TBI. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) was generated from a varied sequence of environmental stressors distributed within each of 21 days. Subsequently, mice received a mild blast combined with closed‐head mild TBI on 5 days at 24‐h intervals. In males and females, UCMS induced anxiety without depressive behavior. A major finding was reproducible sleep–wake dysfunction through 6‐ to 12‐month time points in male mice that received UCMS with repetitive blast plus TBI events, or surprisingly after just UCMS alone. Specifically, male mice exhibited hypersomnia with increased sleep during the active/dark phase and fragmentation of longer wake bouts. Sleep–wake dysfunction was not found with TBI events alone, and hypersomnia was not found in females under any conditions. These results identify prolonged stress and sex differences as important considerations for sleep–wake dysfunction. Furthermore, this reproducible hypersomnia with impaired wakefulness is similar to the excessive daytime sleepiness reported in patients, including patients with TBI, which warrants further clinical screening, care, and treatment development.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

Patients showed substantial neuropsychological deficits, fragmented nocturnal sleep and, in half the patients, sleep apnea and/or hypopnea both mainly of central type. There was no statistically significant correlation between the degree of daytime cognitive deficit and the degree of sleep fragmentation or of respiratory problems at night. It was concluded that the neuropsychological deficit in mytonic dystrophy cannot be attributed to a secondary effect of nocturnal sleep apnea or sleep disruption but probably represents a direct effect of CNS lesions.",

Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a condition that results from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure cessation or from the initiation of mechanisms, leading to prolonged seizures. This is a condition that can have long-term effects (especially if the duration is &gt;30 minutes) such as death, injury, and changes in neuronal tissue depending on the type and duration of the seizure. The human brain consumes a very disproportionate amount of energy given its relatively small size, thus requiring a system capable of balancing cellular oxygen metabolism and brain blood flow control in order to maintain brain oxygen levels. Seizures have been shown to cause changes in oxygen levels beyond the normoxic range, which increases the likelihood that seizure-induced changes in brain pO2 may affect brain function during and after seizures. Decreased oxygenation is common during epileptic seizures. This has been seen on digital pulse oximetry (which measures oxygenation of either the fingers or toes) in the 25-33% saturation range when they have seizures. Such hypoxemia is more common in seizures that are generalized (ie begin as or become generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and/or prolonged.",

      "abstract": "Normal conscious behaviour means awareness of self and the environment and depends on intact brain function.'Changes in the level of consciousness reflect an abnormal function of the brain.The degree, depth, and duration of altered consciousness may vary from drowsiness to brain death, and \"coma\" or un- consciousness is best defined as an inability to obey commands, utter recognisable words, or open the eyes.2Pathological conditions associated with this state are brain injury from trauma; cerebrovascular accidents; hypoxia; hypotension (low perfusion states); uncontrolled epilepsy; and disorders of metabolism, such as hepatic and renal failure and drug overdose.As well as managing the primary cause of the coma, energetic treatment is needed to prevent the complications of unconscious- ness, the most serious of which are hypoxia and hypotension.All unconscious patients run the risk of an obstructed airway from the tongue falling back into the oropharynx.The inability to cough or swallow leads to an accumulation of secretions in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi.Vomit and regurgitated gastric contents may be inhaled giving rise to the acid-aspiration (Mendelson's) syndrome in the lungs.The already damaged brain cannot withstand any further insults that may occur from inadequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion due to a low arterial Po2 or low blood pressure.3The unconscious patient may need total care for days, weeks, or months, the problems being those of maintaining vital functions (adequate ventilation, circulation, and nutrition) and general nursing care.Anaesthesia is a pharmacologically induced state of uncon- sciousness and the well-trained anaesthetists of today, with their skill in care of the airway, endotracheal intubation, intravenous cannulation, ventilator management, and knowledge of applied pharmacology and respiratory physiology, are particularly able to care for these patients.The skills and lessons learnt in the operating theatre have enabled them to take part in the development, organisation, and management of patients in immediate care schemes and intensive treatment units and to teach these skills to other doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and ambulance men.",

      "abstract": "FIFTEEN to 20 million Americans suffer chronically from the tyranny of insomnia. Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

      "title": "Disrupted Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Schizophrenia and Their Interaction With Dopamine Signaling",
      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a common feature of schizophrenia, and is associated with symptom severity and patient quality of life. It is commonly manifested as disturbances to the sleep/wake cycle, with sleep abnormalities occurring in up to 80% of patients, making it one of the most common symptoms of this disorder. Severe circadian misalignment has also been reported, including non-24 h periods and phase advances and delays. In parallel, there are alterations to physiological circadian parameters such as body temperature and rhythmic hormone production. At the molecular level, alterations in the rhythmic expression of core clock genes indicate a dysfunctional circadian clock. Furthermore, genetic association studies have demonstrated that mutations in several clock genes are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia. Collectively, the evidence strongly suggests that sleep and circadian disruption is not only a symptom of schizophrenia but also plays an important causal role in this disorder. The alterations in dopamine signaling that occur in schizophrenia are likely to be central to this role. Dopamine is well-documented to be involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, in which it acts to promote wakefulness, such that elevated dopamine levels can disturb sleep. There is also evidence for the influence of dopamine on the circadian clock, such as through entrainment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and dopamine signaling itself is under circadian control. Therefore dopamine is closely linked with sleep and the circadian system; it appears that they have a complex, bidirectional relationship in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, such that disturbances to one exacerbate abnormalities in the other. This review will provide an overview of the evidence for a role of SCRD in schizophrenia, and examine the interplay of this with altered dopamine signaling. We will assess the evidence to suggest common underlying mechanisms in the regulation of sleep/circadian rhythms and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Improvements in sleep are associated with improvements in symptoms, along with quality of life measures such as cognitive ability and employability. Therefore the circadian system holds valuable potential as a new therapeutic target for this disorder.",

Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population.

The medical history was free of psychiatric disorders and abuse of psychoactive substances.Apart from mild attention and concentration deficits with a mildly depressed mood the psychiatric findings were normal.Consistent with the preliminary diagnosis of a primary non-benzodiazepine dependence (zopiclone), after withdrawal of zopiclone the patient suffered from inner restlessness and psychomotor agitation, vague abdominal pain, and hypertension. The symptoms subsided after administration and subsequent gradual discontinuation of diazepam.Zopiclone dependence has repeatedly been reported in patients with pre-existing substance-related addictions, and in patients with other psychiatric disorders. Primary zopiclone dependence may be regarded as rare. Despite the low dependence potential of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, the indication of prescription should be thoroughly considered.",

PRES can unfold acutely or subacutely, with symptoms developing within hours to days. Often, the presentation occurs in the context of acute uncontrolled hypertension, with systolic blood pressures ranging between 160 to 190 mmHg. The name designated to this clinical and radiographic syndrome is inspired from (1) radiographic findings of white matter edema (i.e., hyperintense T2 signal or hypointense T1 signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), typically found in the posterior cerebrum in a symmetric fashion (although asymmetric presentations are possible); and (2) the fact that symptoms are reversible, provided that the syndrome is recognized and treated promptly. However, the name used to describe the syndrome is misleading because the edema is not localized necessarily to the posterior cerebrum white matter and can appear in watershed zones other than parietal-occipital regions thalamus, and sometimes in the anterior circulation. Moreover, the syndrome is not always reversible. Some individuals can develop life-threatening complications, such as transforaminal cerebellar herniation and focal neurologic deficits, especially if prompt treatment is not initiated.",

      "title": "Pseudopheochromocytoma",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pseudopheochromocytoma is a rare but often disabling syndrome of paroxysmal severe hypertension and symptoms of catecholamine excess, including feelings of anxiety, tremor, sweating and palpitations [1]. In some patients, other features are also present including chest pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, pseudoseizures and paradoxically low blood pressures. Episodes tend to have rapid onset and last from a few minutes up to a few hours and be followed by intense fatigue that can last for several days. During episodes, many patients feel as though they 'might die'. Although many of the presenting features of pseudopheochromocytoma resemble those of pheochromocytoma, the main difference is that there is no definite anatomical or biochemical abnormality, although evidence of mild to moderate catecholamine excess may be present, particularly during paroxysms. Other reported biochemical abnormalities in pseudopheochromocytoma include elevated peripheral plasma dopamine sulphate levels [2] but these are not present in all patients. Pseudopheochromocytoma has clinical similarities with both Page's syndrome [3] ('hypertensive diencephalic syndrome') which was first described in 1935, and autonomic epilepsy which is occasionally associated with tumours or cysts in the thalamic region [4] but can occur as an unexplained entity. To date, no anatomical thalamic abnormalities have been confirmed in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Psychological aspects Pseudopheochromocytoma is largely a diagnosis of exclusion, which requires careful screening for any treatable pheochromocytoma before the diagnosis is made. There is considerable overlap between pseudopheochromocytoma and panic disorder conditions and it is not known to what extent psychological factors can influence the often severe acute rise in blood pressure seen in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma during paroxysms. Indeed, pseudopheochromocytoma has been associated with a history of traumatic psychological experiences during childhood or a tendency to suppress distressing emotions, and psychotherapy has been useful in relieving symptoms in many patients [5]. Multifactorial causes Increasingly, we are realizing that in most complex disorders, including hypertension, it is the exception to find a unifactorial cause and in the vast majority of cases, a large number of factors act together to influence the development of the condition in any one individual. The same is likely to be true in pseudopheochromocytoma, where many different factors, including both somatic and supratentorial elements, probably interplay in any one patient to cause the clinical syndrome. It is also likely that there is heterogeneity among patients, with differences in the severity and clinical features which lead to the label of pseudopheochromocytoma. Secondary causes of pseudopheochromocytoma-like symptoms When assessing a patient with pseudopheochromocytoma-like symptoms, it is important to ascertain whether the syndrome may be secondary to another condition, e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea [6] or drug therapy, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetic agents or reboxetine [7] all of which can raise sympathetic activity. Other conditions aside from pheochromocytoma that can present in a similar way to pseudopheochromocytoma include systemic mastocytosis, cocaine use and reninoma. Sympathoadrenal function in pseudopheochromocytoma In the current issue of the Journal, Sharabi et al. [8] have published one of the largest series of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma in the literature to date and have attempted to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying the condition, by studying the role of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal function in pseudopheochromocytoma. This was a difficult study to do, partly due to difficulty recruiting patients with the true condition but also due to uncertainty as to what the primary endpoint should be, according to which the study should be powered. As a result of this, many measurements were made, with no single primary outcome measure defined. Plasma catecholamine levels and haemodynamic parameters were measured following the administration of various pharmacological manipulators of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal function in a group of 11 patients with pseudopheochromocytoma and 14 healthy controls. Baseline levels of plasma catecholamines and metanephrine, the O-methylated metabolite of epinephrine, were also measured and functional imaging of the adrenal medulla was performed using the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [18F]fluorodopamine. Pharmacological manipulation of sympathoadrenal function The pharmacological agents administered in the study were as follows: the ganglion blocker trimethaphan, which is a competitive antagonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors at autonomic ganglia and inhibits both sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow; yohimbine, which is a competitive α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, which increases adrenal production of epinephrine and norepinephrine by binding to preganglionic α2-adrenoceptors and blocking the negative feedback inhibition of catecholamine production; isoproterenol which is a β-adrenoceptor agonist; and glucagon which stimulates epinephrine production. Results The main findings of the current study were of increased adrenal epinephrine release and increased circulatory responses to catecholamines in the patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. In the current study, patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had higher baseline plasma epinephrine levels but similar norepinephrine levels to controls. In contrast, a previous study showed no difference between baseline plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma and controls [9]. No abnormality in adrenomedullary function was observed on [18F]fluorodopamine PET scanning in the patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Ganglion blockers When interpreting the effects of the ganglion blockade by trimethaphan, it is worth bearing a few points in mind. First, trimethaphan, in addition to blocking the autonomic ganglia, causes histamine release, unlike the alternative ganglion blocker, pentolinium. Trimethaphan also has a shorter half-life than pentolinium. Pentolinium is sometimes used as a diagnostic suppression test in the investigation of patients with possible pheochromocytoma [10]. The effects of ganglion blockade depend upon the level of preganglionic stimulation. Pentolinium is good at suppressing physiological elevations of epinephrine but has less effect if epinephrine levels are normal at baseline. In contrast, clonidine, which is also used as a suppression test in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, is not very effective in suppressing epinephrine, but suppresses norepinephrine levels well. The authors did not include the pentolinium suppression test as an evaluation of the pseudopheochromocytoma patients included in this study. In the current study, the results in response to trimethaphan are somewhat surprising in that there was a lesser fall in norepinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma than in controls. This could be explained by the fact that the pseudopheochromocytoma patients started with significantly lower baseline levels of norepinephrine than the controls and ganglion blockers are less effective at lowering norepinephrine levels from a lower baseline level. With regard to epinephrine levels, if as the authors suggest, there are higher baseline epinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma, one might expect to see an exaggerated drop in epinephrine levels in response to trimethaphan administration; however, the authors did not report the changes in epinephrine levels with trimethaphan. Potential role of dopamine in pseudopheochromocytoma The role of dopamine in pseudopheochromocytoma was not directly assessed in this study. Dopamine sulphate levels were found to be three-fold elevated in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma in one study [2] but in patients in the current study, plasma dopamine levels were normal. It is also known that dopamine antagonists can induce hypertensive crisis in patients with pheochromocytoma by blocking the presynaptic negative inhibition of norepinephrine release. Anecdotally, we have had some success in improving the symptoms of pseudopheochromocytoma by using low doses of the dopamine agonist cabergoline; however, the unproven benefits would need to be weighed against the reported association between some dopamine agonists and cardiac valvular fibrosis when used at high doses. Role of adrenoceptor sensitivity in pseudopheochromocytoma A previous study by Hamada et al.[9] showed that patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had a significantly greater systolic blood pressure response to a valsalva manoeuvre than patients with pheochromocytoma, essential hypertension or normal controls. The systolic blood pressure rise was suppressed by the prior administration of non-selective β-blockade or α1-blockade. They concluded that patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had β and α1-adrenoceptor hypersensitivity. It is known that β-blockers and α1-blockers relieve symptoms in some patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Interestingly, while α-blockers are the mainstay of medical therapy for pheochromocytoma (sometimes combined with β-blockade depending on the degree of tachycardia on α-blockade, which is often related to the amount of epinephrine production), patients with pseudopheochromocytoma tend to have a slightly better response to β-blockade, although often α1-blockade is used in combination. Antidepressants may also have a role in the management of pseudopheochromocytoma. Conclusions While the current study represents an important addition to the limited literature on pseudopheochromocytoma, unfortunately it has not yet fully explained the mechanisms of pseudopheochromocytoma or provided any specific diagnostic test for the condition. The findings support the use of α-blockade and β-blockade in the management of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma but have not suggested any other possible treatments. The authors should, however, be congratulated on ascertaining and studying a cohort of patients with this rare but important condition. Further publications of well-phenotyped series of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma should be encouraged to help improve our understanding and treatment of the condition.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare neurological sleep disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness despite normal sleep duration, that can significantly impact patient's lives. The burden of IH goes beyond excessive daytime sleepiness, pervading all aspects of everyday life. Characteristic and burdensome symptoms of IH include sleep inertia/drunkenness, long sleep duration, and daytime cognitive dysfunction. This systematic review assessed current knowledge regarding IH diagnostic challenges and burden of illness. Literature searches for original epidemiological, clinical, humanistic, or economic research relevant to IH published between 2012 and 2022 in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, gray literature (diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines), conferences (2019-2022), and clinical trial databases yielded 97 articles. Findings indicate that IH remains a poorly defined diagnosis of exclusion that is difficult to distinguish from narcolepsy type 2 because of symptom overlap and inadequacies of objective testing. Consequently, individuals with IH endure diagnostic delays of up to 9 years. The economic burden of IH has not been characterized to any appreciable extent. Pharmacological treatment options can improve symptoms and functional status, but rarely restores normal levels of functioning. These findings highlight the need to reclassify central disorders of hypersomnolence. Further collaboration is now required between research groups to identify and validate objective markers to help redefine diagnostic criteria for IH. This would move IH into a position that could benefit from future targeted therapeutic interventions. The study was funded by Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc.",

      "abstract": "A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction. However, motor behavior reportedly can accompany PTSD dreams, and normal REM sleep typically involves a nearly total paralysis of the body musculature. As a means of understanding this discrepancy, anterior tibialis muscle activity during sleep was studied in a group of Vietnam combat veterans with current PTSD and in an age-matched normal control group. The PTSD subjects had a higher percentage of REM sleep epochs with at least one prolonged twitch burst; they also were more likely to have periodic limb movements in sleep, during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Both these forms of muscle activation also have been observed in REM behavior disorder (RBD), a parasomnia characterized by the actual enactment of dream sequences during REM sleep. The identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep phasic mechanisms in PTSD.",

Actigraphy is cheap, less labor intensive for the sleep laboratory and gives no burden for the patient. Major features of sleep (time in bed, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and naps during the day) are easily quantified. If done over at least five days the results are in a reasonable way comparable to those of PSG. Obviously, actigraphy provides less details of sleep and the way it is disturbed. From the combination of PSG and one week actigraphy, one gets all details of sleep and wake and their fluctuations over time. As \"stand alone\" technique, actigraphy is indicated in young children, mentally handicapped patients and in the assessment of therapy for sleep disorders. In our opinion assessment of sleep disorders in children should include actigraphy over at least 5-7 24 hour days, if possible combined with one or two nights PSG. As there are no strict rules and normal values for MSLT in children, actigraphy is also helpful as tool for global assessment of hypersomnia in young patients.",

Sleep terrors, nightmares and rapid eye movement behavioral disorder can be confused with seizures.

We reviewed clinical and laboratory information on 42 subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia and obtained detailed follow-up evaluations on 28 of them. Only 29% of subjects had 'classic' idiopathic hypersomnia with non-imperative sleepiness, long unrefreshing naps, prolonged night-time sleep, difficult awakening with sleep drunkenness and prominent mood disturbances. Thirty-two percent had clinical features similar to narcolepsy, i.e. irresistible sleepiness, short and refreshing naps, few problems with awakening and good response to stimulants, without cataplexy or any indication of abnormal REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. The other 39% had intermediate clinical characteristics. We found no increase in the frequency of the human leucocyte antigens associated with narcolepsy. Overall, response to stimulants was good in three-quarters of the patients and spontaneous improvement of sleepiness occurred in one-quarter. Possible aetiologies identified in 10 patients included viral illness, head trauma and primary mood disorder. Idiopathic hypersomnia is a rare syndrome in which clinical heterogeneity suggests a variable or multifactoral pathogenesis. Only a minority of cases correspond to classical descriptions. Stimulants are often beneficial and spontaneous improvement appears to be more common than in narcolepsy.",

This article concerns the investigation of a group that has received less attention: those whose first attendance is delayed, who reattend, or develop complications after a period of observation. Delay in the initial presentation or unplanned return to the A&E department after head injury can occur for a variety of reasons. The abuse of alcohol or drugs may lead to signs of an injury being noted only after the patient wakes up or is found still in coma long after the effects of the agent should have cleared. Sometimes seemingly trivial injury leads to attendance some hours, days, or even weeks later because of persisting or worsening symptoms. Studies in South Africa, England, and Scotland' showed that about 2-3 % of A&E patients reattend after being sent home with an apparently minor head injury (only 0.2% of the total new A&E attenders). Most of these have responded to advice given at the time of discharge and have developed symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or vomiting prompting reattendance within two weeks of the injury. In Scotland in 1979 the annual incidence of an intracranial haematoma undergoing surgery was shown to be 4.5 per 100 000 population.4 Data from a regional neurosurgical unit indicate that one fifth of these are pure extradural haematomas and over two thirds are intradural haematomas, which is the commoner finding at all stages after injury. A report in 1980 showed that over one quarter of surgical intracranial haematomas received surgery after three days (table 1).5 This pattern may have changed with the increased use of computed tomography but intradural haematomas (subdural and intracerebral) still tend to present later than extradural haematomas. Patients with chronic subdural haematoma (a subdural collection of dark fluid occurring at three weeks after injury or later) reach neurosurgical units at the annual rate of one per 100 000 population.6 7",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Background: Delirium is a common disorder, and can occur in children and adults. It is short lasting, with duration ranging from hours to days. However, prolonged delirium can occur in people with brain damage. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition that occurs when the entire brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. HIE results in neurological injury and long term dysfunction. Outcome of HIE ranges from significant changes in personality, impairment in memory, cognition and attention, to coma and vegetative states. Only a quarter of patients survive to be discharged from hospital. There are very few case reports of prolonged delirium secondary to HIE following hanging.\r\nCase description: A 27 year old Asian man with alcohol dependence syndrome developed prolonged delirium (more than two months) following HIE subsequent to hanging.\r\nDiscussion: Prolonged delirium has been reported in 1/3rd cases of delirium. Risk factors for prolonged delirium are increasing age, severe delirium, increasing number of medical conditions. Prolonged delirium was found to be associated with poor functional outcome and increased mortality.\r\nConclusion: Our case report highlights the importance of early detection and management of prolonged delirium.",

      "title": "Short Term Modafinil Use During Sleep Disorder Evaluations: Focus on High Risk Professions and Behaviors",
      "abstract": "Patients can present with undiagnosed sleep disorders. Modest fatigue can impair their neurological, functional and psychological capacities. Four patients demonstrated improved functioning on modafinil, during the months required for a complete sleep evaluation, specialist consults and successful treatment. Sleep disorders increase morbidity or mortality until definitive diagnosis and full treatment. In four patients, modafinil was immediately useful as a bridging medication over 3-7 months until final successful diagnosis and treatment. Even one month of significant fatigue is unacceptable. For example, driving a motor vehicle is dangerous with some sleep disorders. Falling asleep driving or involuntary “minisleep” at the wheel is a common cause of motor vehicle accidents.1 In the United States, sleep causes at least 56, 000 motor vehicle crashes each year, resulting in 1, 550 deaths.2 Over a year, 10% of men and 4% of women admitted to falling asleep while driving.3 Insight into drowsiness can be flawed, lagging behind electroencephalographic and other evidence that the process of falling asleep has actually started.4 In clinical care, the patient may be sleepy or fatigued, but not a clear risk to drive or work. Further, many occupations do not allow for fatigue, sleepiness and errors, e.g., truck drivers, heavy construction operators, nurses dispensing medications, pilots, boat captains, military and police personnel using dangerous equipment, and childcare workers with children. Modafinil was used because it may be more selective than traditional stimulants, has a low abuse potential, is already used in many specific sleep disorders, and has a reasonable safety record. Modafinil's mechanism as a waking agent appears to be a more selective than amphetamine or methylphenidate in cats, 5 possibly causing less emotional side effects in humans, e.g., agitation and rebound depression. Perhaps due to this proposed selectivity, modafinil receives low ratings for abuse desirability, 6 and with a low solubility in water and instability at high temperatures, I.V. injections and smoking were less likely. 7 These are some reasons that modafinil might be considered in light of the non-specificity and addiction potential of traditional stimulants. Modafinil has cognitive benefits in aviation alertness and functioning. 8, 9 It decreases fatigue in narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and fibromyalgia.10,11,12,13,14,15 Also, medically fragile patients seemed to tolerate modafinil. Our patients were much healthier than those treated with Parkinson's disease, stroke and multiple sclerosis. These private patients were all waiting for a sleep specialist appointment. They read handouts on the common use of modafinil, e.g., narcolepsy. However, they understood they were trying it for the off-label purpose of daytime sleepiness. Rare questions were answered to their satisfaction.",

      "title": "Non-Intrusive Analytical Approaches to Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Samy, Lauren | Advisor(s): Sarrafzadeh, Majid | Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and the most prevalent sleep disorder in general. Approximately 22 million people in the United States and more than 100 million people worldwide are affected by this serious disorder. The disorder is characterized by repeated involuntary breathing cessations (apnea) or reductions in breathing (hypopnea) during sleep, accompanied by oxygen desaturation (hypoxia). The apneas occur due to the obstruction of the upper airway as a result of the relaxing of throat tissue. The hypoxia triggers a brain activity arousal to restore the normal breathing pattern until the next apneic episode occurs. OSA patients can experience hundreds of apneas per night. The frequent sleep disruptions and the resulting fragmented sleep pattern can have serious physical and psychological consequences and can lead to premature death. Because the apnea episodes rarely trigger a full awakening, patients are often unaware of having difficulty breathing at night. As a result of this unawareness, OSA is severely underdiagnosed. This problem is exacerbated by the intrusiveness of current diagnosis methods. Polysomnography---the traditional gold-standard diagnosis method---requires close overnight monitoring of patients' body functions, making it an uncomfortable and intrusive diagnostic test. Intrusive diagnosis methods discourage patients from getting tested for OSA until they experience its serious health effects. As a result, many patients remain untreated and OSA continues to be a major public health problem that places a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. In an effort to increase the level of diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, this work investigates the design and implementation of effective non-intrusive OSA diagnostic methods. We explore two kinds of detection methods: nocturnal methods that rely on diagnosing OSA by detecting apneic episodes from overnight recordings, as well as daytime methods which use features and signals that can be obtained while the subject is awake. This work involves identifying the data to be collected, building the appropriate systems to obtain them, and using machine learning techniques to analyze them. The effectiveness of our methods was proven using real data from clinical trials. Daytime methods quickly revealed their advantages over the common nocturnal methods and the few existing daytime methods.Experimental results show that our daytime methods perform the initial diagnosis of OSA non-intrusively without significantly affecting the diagnosis accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art nocturnal methods.",

      "abstract": "La douleur est une cause majeure de l'insomnie chez les malades et plus de 70% des patients en douleur se plaignent de troubles du sommeil. Des études polysomnographiques ont démontré que les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique affichent une perturbation marquée de la structure et de la continuité du sommeil. Les constatations les plus courantes sont: changements fréquents de phases de sommeil, augmentation des réveils nocturnes, diminution du sommeil à ondes lentes et du sommeil à mouvements oculaires rapides, augmentation du sommeil superficiel et des mouvements du corps, intrusion électroencéphalographique (EEG) de sommeil alpha-delta, augmentation du nombre d'éveils et du taux de pattern d'activation cyclique (PAC). Le PAC est un marqueur physiologique du sommeil instable qui amplifie les réactions aux événements perturbateurs de la consolidation du sommeil. Ainsi, la qualité du sommeil dépend de mécanismes cérébraux qui évaluent les événements externes afin de protéger l'intégrité vitale. Ces mécanismes, situés au niveau thalamique, commande le maintien du sommeil, l'éveil bref ou le réveil comportemental, selon le risque que représente l'événement en cause. Pendant le sommeil, le système neurovégétatif demeure réceptif aux stimuli externes et opère en synchronie avec le processus PAC. Chez les sujets sains, la stimulation thermique nociceptive provoque une accélération du rythme cardiaque peu importe la phase du sommeil, avec un gradient décroissant de la phase 2 au sommeil à ondes lentes et au sommeil MOR. Les réponses autonomiques peuvent varier chez les patients fibromyalgiques n'affichant pas la diminution normale de l'activité sympathique pendant le sommeil et chez les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique qui sont déjà aux prises avec la fragmentation du sommeil ou l'insomnie. Les modifications spécifiques du sommeil découlant d'un syndrome unique de douleur ou de parasomnies associées à la douleur pendant le sommeil (par ex. le bruxisme, les crampes nocturnes dans les jambes et le reflux gastro-œsophagien) sont également décrites.",

With appropriate sensitivity, the interviewer should physically demonstrate these tics when inquiring about their presence. If duration of motor tics is less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

Approximately 25% of all children develop sleep problems ranging from difficulty falling asleep and night awakenings to more serious sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. The complications related to sleep disorder include cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive conditions as well as failure to thrive and growth retardation. Children also developed social and academic growth retardation. This chapter describes how to recognize, evaluate, and treat sleep disorders in children. This chapter also addresses sleep problems and special populations including pregnancy and menopausal states. Maternal sleep quality in the perinatal period begins to change; it has been noted that the greatest sleep disruption tends to occur approximately 1 week postpartum. Approximately 50% of women experience excessive daytime sleepiness at 18 weeks postpartum. Postpartum major depression is a serious illness that occurs in approximately 13% of mothers, negatively affecting both the mother's and child's psychological adjustment. Poor sleep clearly is a major confounder in maternal depression. Menopause is a time of change of life for women. By definition, menopause is considered when there has been the absence of menstrual periods for 1 year. Hormonal changes begin 7–10 years before the final menses. During this perimenopausal period, the pituitary-gonadal axis changes with decreasing estradiol and progesterone and rising FSH and LH.",

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract How we sleep affects our waking hours. Poor sleep translates into poor day-time performance. For those with PD, sleep is frequently disordered and this affects the waking day, including control of parkinsonism. Insomnia is a common problem in the general population and increases with aging. When we are young, we typically have no trouble getting adequate sleep. Teenagers left undisturbed on a Saturday morning will sleep till noon. As we age, getting to sleep or staying asleep often becomes increasingly difficult. Sometimes this relates to life stressors; lying in bed ruminating about the day’s events is a frequent cause of insomnia. Depression is a common human affliction and insomnia may be one symptom. Finally, some people simply have insomnia as part of their constitutional makeup.",

      "abstract": "Slaapdeprivatie en obesitas zijn grote publieke gezondheidsproblemen met grote sociale-, persoonlijke- en gezondheidszorgkosten en problemen. Slaapdeprivatie is geassocieerd met obesitas in vele epidemiologische studies. De prevalentie van obesitas neemt toe en de gemiddelde slaapduur neemt af, maar waar deze correlatie vandaan komt en welk causaal mechanisme hiervoor verantwoordelijk is is nog niet vastgesteld. De vraag die in deze scriptie beantwoord zal worden is wat de invloed is van slaapdeprivatie op voedselinname en obesitas en welk causaal mechanisme hieraan ten grondslag ligt. \r\n\r\nSlaapdeprivatie is een toestand waarin men onvoldoende, 5 uur in 24 uur, slaap krijgt, dit leidt tot een homeostatisch stressvolle situatie waardoor het lichaam meer energie wil opslaan om hierop te kunnen anticiperen. In onze huidige maatschappij is er altijd meer dan voldoende voedsel aanwezig wat ertoe leidt dat een dergelijke situatie leidt tot gewichtstoename. De prefrontale cortex, thalamus, parietale kwab en het limbische systeem laten verhoogde activiteit zien bij slaapdeprivatie, wat ertoe kan leiden dat men humeuriger wordt, de cognitieve - en motorische prestaties achteruit gaan en de remming op gedragingen verminderd wordt. Slaapdeprivatie leidt tot verhoogd energieverbruik (90 kcal) door additionele waaktijd en verhoogde energie inname (300-550 kcal) door verhoogde inname van snacks laat op de avond, wat een positieve energiebalans als gevolg heeft. De voedingsmiddelen die geconsumeerd worden bevatten meer vet, koolhydraten en zijn energierijker en verhoogde inname hiervan zal uiteindelijk leiden tot gewichtstoename. Wanneer er onderzocht wordt wat de causaliteit is van deze observeringen wordt er geen netto effect gezien van de hormonen ghreline en leptine, en het effect van GLP-1 is sekse afhankelijk. Slaapdeprivatie induceert verhoogde activiteit in hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor plezier, beloning, motivatie en salience. Met name de insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal prefrontale cortex en de OFC zijn geactiveerd, waarbij er verhoogde connectiviteit is gezien tussen de dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, de insula en het putamen. \r\n\r\nDoor slaapdeprivatie worden gebieden in de hersenen geactiveerd, dit wordt geinduceerd vanuit de hypothalamus naar hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor genot, beloning en motivatie. Deze activatie leidt tot een grotere salience en verhoogde beloning van ongezonde voeding, waardoor men deze voedingsmiddelen meer gaat consumeren als reactie op slaapdeprivatie wat op den duur zal leiden tot gewichtstoename en obesitas.",

      "abstract": "Arousal and sleep represent fundamental physiological domains, and alterations in the form of insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) or hypersomnia (increased propensity for falling asleep or increased sleep duration) are prevalent clinical problems. Current first-line treatments include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Despite significant success, a number of patients do not benefit sufficiently. Progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of the ­neurobiology of insomnia and hypersomnia. This work summarizes current concepts of the regulation of arousal and sleep and its modulation through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic, current, and auditory stimulation. Particularly, we suggest: (1) characterization of patients with sleep problems – across diagnostic entities of mental disorders – based on specific alterations of sleep, including alterations of sleep slow waves, sleep spindles, cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations, local sleep-wake regulation, and REM sleep and (2) targeting these with specific NIBS techniques. While evidence is accumulating that the modulation of specific alterations of sleep through NIBS is feasible, it remains to be tested whether this translates to clinically relevant effects and new treatment developments.",

      "title": "Depresija kao javnozdravstveni problem",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

Such patients complain of increased urination (pollakiuria), urinary incontinence (enuresis), urinary retention, or loss of urination. As a rule, for the first time, such patients turn to a pediatrician (therapist), then to a urologist who, after a comprehensive examination, excludes any organic violation of the genitourinary system. Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy. The given clinical example is of scientific and practical interest, since the full effect was achieved after the first consultation and one session of hypnotic suggestive therapy.",

After clinical evaluation and overnight, hospital-based video-polysomnography, the cause of the chronic injurious parasomnia was deemed to be a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parasomnia comorbid with severe obstructive sleep apnea. Therapy with bedtime clonazepam and bilevel positive airway pressure was effective, with injurious parasomnia relapse occurring with cessation of either or both of these therapies. The differential diagnosis of sleep-related biting should now include NREM sleep parasomnia (with or without comorbid obstructive sleep apnea), besides previously reported cases of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder and anticipated cases of parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnia), sleep-related biting seizures, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

Orexin receptor antagonism, a new sleep-promoting paradigm: an ascending single-dose study with almorexant. Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2010, 87, 593-600. Targeting the Orexin System: A New Approach for Treating Insomnia Sleep is an essential part of our everyday lives that matters more than most people realize. Regulation of the sleep-waking cycle is complex, involving multiple neurological circuits and diverse endogenous molecules. Interplay among assorted neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems maintain the waking state. Sleep-onset is governed by the interacting forces of the sleep drive, which steadily increases with duration of waking and circadian fluctuations. Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that sleep disorders are common and often untreated. Insomnia, one of the most common sleep disorders among adults, is a symptom of difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep associated with impaired next-day functioning and an increased risk for accidents. Insomnia treatment continues to be dominated by benzodiazepines and related compounds, which are powerful sedatives that enhance the inhibitory action of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) in the brain. The hypocretins/orexins are recently-discovered peptides with a discrete localization in the lateral hypothalamus. A single gene encodes hypocretin, which is cleaved by proteolytic processing into two smaller peptides: hypocretin-1 (orexin A) and hypocretin-2 (orexin B). These neurons project throughout the entire brain and spinal cord, providing especially heavy innervation to forebrain and brainstem neuronal populations implicated in wakefulness. Hypocretin/orexin has been implicated in narcolepsy, a human sleep disorder. Two orexin receptor subtypes, OX1R and OX2R, have been cloned. They are serpentine G-protein coupled receptors that bind both orexins with low selectivity and are coupled functionally to Ca++ mobilization, probably through transient receptor potential channels. The hypocretin/orexin system plays an important role in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, especially in the maintenance of long, consolidated awake periods. Increased hypocretin/orexin activity has been observed during waking and at the end of sleep. Almorexant, a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, is a reversible, selective, orally active non-selective OX1 and OX2 receptor antagonist that inhibits functional consequences of OX1 and OX2 receptor activation, such as intracellular Ca++ mobilization. Almorexant promotes sleep in a dose-dependent manner in both healthy volunteers and in patients with primary insomnia. In a new single-dose study, Almorexant was administered in an ascending single-dose (1-1,000 mg) to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. In this study, subjects showed no decrements on motor function or reactive time on the following day. No evidence of cataplexy or abnormal REM behavior was reported. However, new studies involving night-time administration in relation of Almorexan in patients with sleep disorders are necessary to explore the role of the hypocretin/orexin during the circadian cycle. Modulation of the sleep-wake cycle is very much a question of timing of dosing, so the development of dosage at the optimal time will be essential for this approach. On the other hand, most of the published compounds targeting the hypocretin/orexin system have been developed using radioliganddisplacement assays or simple functional assays (intracellular Ca++ release) in recombinant cells. Hypocretin/orexin signaling cascades operating in the central nervous system will allow the development of more specific assays and generate compounds to block or activate defined branches of the signaling cascades (e.g. MAP kinase cascades), potentially creating drugs with different efficacy profiles.",

The bidirectional association between sleep and headache is mediated by a temporal link (headache occurs during sleep, after sleep, and in relationship with sleep stages), by a quantitative relationship (excess, lack, bad quality, short duration of sleep may trigger headache), and by a reciprocal connection (headache may cause sleep disruption and may be associated with several sleep disturbances). This association is most evident for primary headache disorders, especially in childhood. A congenital alteration of neurotransmitter pathways (serotoninergic and dopaminergic) might predispose individuals to both disorders, presenting as sleep–wake rhythm disorder in infancy or as headache disorder later in childhood, as result of this neurotransmitter imbalance. Clinicians should be aware that a complete clinical evaluation of childhood headache includes a careful sleep history, taking into account that the treatment of sleep disturbances could lead to an improvement of headache symptoms and vice versa.

Secondary insomnia, sleep disturbance caused by a psychiatric or medical disorder, although it is more common than primary insomnia, has received very little attention as a result of the belief that it would be refractory to treatment. The present study randomly assigned older adults with secondary insomnia to a treatment group, 4 sessions composed of relaxation and stimulus control, or a no-treatment control group. Self-report assessments conducted at pretreatment, posttreatment, and a 3-month follow-up revealed that treated participants showed significantly greater improvement on wake time during the night, sleep efficiency percentage, and sleep quality rating.

Persisting rapport, duration of a prearranged distorted reaction to date-questioning, and subsequent total amnesia were taken as criteria for prolonged hypnosis. They were met by five of ten trained, highly susceptible Ss. Normal sleep can apparently occur parallel with hypnosis, without interfering with it. Implications for a theory of hypnosis are discussed.",

It is characterized by a tetrad of symptoms, which include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnogogic hallucinations. Individuals may experience severe negative psychosocial consequences associated with these symptoms. The neuropathology of narcolepsy is largely unknown. Current work implicates decreased production or utilization of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin in the brain, and excessively numerous or hypersensitive cholinergic receptors in the brain. Medical management includes the use of separate drug therapies to control sleep attacks and cataplectic episodes. Nursing management requires comprehensive assessment of the interplay between the patient and environment and assistance with long-term coping.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

Although many people tend to experience sleep disturbances on an occasional basis owing to stressful life situations, alterations in job schedules, traveling, and many other external influences, but when these issues occur regularly and become an impedance in the day-to-day activities, it may be suggestive of a sleeping disorder. A deficiency of a good quality sleep can have overall undesirable consequences on the vitality, temperament, attentiveness, and well-being of an individual. Sleep difficulties are linked to both physical and emotional problems. Sleep problems can both contribute to and exacerbate existing mental problems as well as serve as an important indicator of other mental health conditions. While the various sleep problems may resolve on its own or eventually conclude after a successful course of therapy, in a few resistant cases the treatment normally involves a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes.",

In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

Brain trauma has a relatively poor prognosis and such patients will often have reduced work ability and a high possibility to stay temporarily or permanently disabled. That is why such injuries are a major public health issue since even less severe brain injuries can result in permanent neuropsychological disorders that affect work ability and quality of life. Traumatic injury can be divided into two phases, primary and secondary. Primary injury is the result of the mechanical force that acts upon the head and brain structures. The development of secondary injury begins after the emergence of the primary and lasts for several days. During this period the damage increases and it is of vital importance to try to reduce the extent of the damage to the affected tissue. Hyperoxia is defined as a greater than normal oxygen percent in the tissues and organs, caused by increased delivery of oxygen or increased percentage o fit in the arterial blood. It can be achieved in normobaric and hyperbaric conditions. Normobaric hyperoxia is achieved under atmospheric conditions, whereas hyperbaric is achieved at pressures higher than atmospheric.\r\nIn the treatment of traumatic brain injury, the main goal is to preserve brain function and reduce the extent of tissue damage. Most important thing is, except ICP control, to maintain proper tissue perfusion and to provide aerobic metabolism. Studies have shown that hyperoxia leads to improved oxygenation and increased aerobic metabolism of injured tissue. In conclusion, further research in this area is needed in order to clearly identify groups of patients that should be recommended for hyperoxia treatment.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most common vascular diseases. The brain as target organs in hypertension is damaged more often and earlier. Neurological complications due to hypertension are frequently hyperdiagnosed in Russian neurological practice. Thus, headache, dizziness, impaired recall of recent events, nocturnal sleep disorders, and many other complaints in a hypertensive patient are usually regarded as a manifestation of dyscirculatory encephalopathy. At the same time headaches (tension headache and migraine) in hypertensive patients are predominantly primary; headache associated with dramatic marked elevations in blood pressure is encountered in only a small number of patients. The role of cerebrovascular diseases in the development of dizziness in hypertensive patients is also overestimated. The vast majority of cases, patients with this complaint are in fact identified to have benign paroxysmal postural vertigo, Mеniеre’s disease, vestibular neuronitis, or vestibular migraine. Psychogenic disorders or multisensory insufficiency are generally responsible for non-systemic vertigo in hypertensive patients. Chronic cerebral circulatory insufficiency may cause non-systemic vertigo as a subjective equivalent of postural instability. Cognitive impairments (CIs) are the most common and earliest manifestation of cerebrovascular lesion in hypertension. In most cases, CIs in hypertension were vascular and associated with cerebrovascular lesion due to lacunar infarcts and leukoaraiosis. However, mixed CIs frequently occur when hypertensive patients are also found to have signs of a degenerative disease, most commonly in Alzheimer’s disease.",

      "title": "Recalcitrant pruritus: A heralding sign of primary Sjogren's syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with miscellaneous cutaneous manifestations, such as xerosis, angular cheilitis, palpebral dermatitis, annular erythema and vasculitis.1 Patients without concomitant associated disease are defined as primary SS (pSS); otherwise, secondary SS is considered.2 Pruritus is a nonspecific, nonpathognomonic, underestimated symptom in SS. We present a patient in whom pSS presented as recalcitrant pruritus. A 78-year-old female was attended with a 7-year history of generalised recalcitrant pruritus. Before visiting, various diagnoses such as senile pruritus and chronic urticaria had been considered, and multiple antisymptomatic medications had failed. The initial visual analogue scale for itch was scored 10 (range: 0–10, the higher, the worse), accounting for notable anxiety. Nocturnal deterioration led to severe insomnia, resistant to oral hypnotics, such as estazolam, dexzopiclone. Physical examination revealed linear excoriations, without skin xerosis, and a negative response to the skin scratch test, ruling out symptomatic dermographism. The patient had no relevant medical or medication history, but during the last 2 years she had been suffering mild oral and ocular dryness, and more recently, moderate fatigue and occasional thigh pain. Antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens revealed anti-Ro/SSA (+) and ANA (+) at titre 1:320, while rheumatoid factor, antiphospholipid antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm/h (range: 0–20 mm/h), and C-reactive protein was normal. The result of Schirmer's test was positive. Labial salivary gland biopsy demonstrated infiltration of lymphocytes around the excretory ducts and destruction of acinar tissue (Figure 1). Potential concomitant conditions, such as hepatitis B, hypothyroidism, IgG4-related disease, lymphoma, and visceral neoplasm were excluded. A diagnosis of pSS was made. Hydroxychloroquine was administered with an induction dosage of 200 mg bid, which led to a significant improvement. After 2 weeks of treatment, the itch visual analogue scale score had decreased to 1, subjective oral and ocular comfort increased, fatigue and thigh pain alleviated, and insomnia partially ameliorated. The dose of hydroxychloroquine was reduced to 100 mg bid after 4 weeks, and remission has remained so far. A cohort study showed that 53% of pSS suffered chronic pruritus; shins (90%) were the most affected sites, followed by the back and forearms, and the pruritus made no difference in pSS duration.3 The pruritus intensity varied with time and season, being more intense in the morning and during the summer. The onset of pruritus ranged from 11 years before pSS diagnosis to 3 years after diagnosis. Pruritus may cause sleep disturbance and undermine the patient's quality of life and psychosomatic function proportionate to its severity.4 The pathogenesis of pruritus in SS is elusive. The lymphocyte-mediated dysfunction of the eccrine gland in SS is hypothesised to be involved in pruritus and xerosis, providing a reasonable explanation for the flare of pruritus in summer and anhidrosis.5 Though impairment of the sweat glands in pSS is not observed, the xerosis is still considered to play a crucial role in pruritus genesis in pSS.3 Furthermore, peripheral sensory neuropathy is common in SS, with a potential role in pruritus.6 Primary biliary cirrhosis, that can be found in association with SS, may be a further pathomechanism involved in pSS pruritus. Finally, other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, nephric disorder, hepatic disorder, and anaemia, may also play a minor role.3 Paraneoplastic pruritus may be another rational explanation for SS associated with neoplasm.7 The lack of response of SS-related pruritus to immunosuppressives indicates that SS-related damage instead of inflammation causes pruritus.8 In conclusion, when nonlesional recalcitrant pruritus, especially in older people, is seen, SS must be ruled out.

Both on the experimental and clinical plan sleep deprivation has been considered to be responsible for psychotic disorders. Over the past fifteen years these results have been controversial. Polygraphic study of sleep in eight patients hospitalized in a post-operative intensive care unit confirmed this nightly sleep deprivation; the deep slow wave sleep decreases and there is often a lack of paradoxical sleep. Analysis of these eight cases corroborates the latest experimental résults on sleep deprivation and current methodological considerations. Sleep deprivation in itself does not seem to lead to major psychiatric disorders but it is one of the factors, contributing to genesis of psychiatric troubles in an intensive care unit. The other ones that have been suggested (environment, somatic pathology, psychological ill effects due to the hospitalization) are also quite important.",

A rather rare and very much less documented side effect of risperidone is hypothermia: traditionally defined as a drop in core body temperature below 35°C (95°F). We report a case of a 75-year-old woman who had been treated for bipolar affective disorder for nearly 3 years with risperidone went on to develop hypothermia which was reversed with the withdrawal of the offending drug. This case is unique as it reported a rare but potentially serious side effect occurring after a prolonged administration of risperidone contrary to the previous reports in which hypothermia occurred only a few hours or days after the administration of risperidone and occurred in a patient who was diagnosed as having bipolar affective disorder as opposed to schizophrenia, the most common psychiatric disorder associated with previously reported hypothermia. The authors would like to emphasize the importance of this idiosyncratic potentially life-threatening adverse effect of risperidone-induced hypothermia to all clinicians, which occurs regardless of the duration of drug intake, in order to help them identify the condition early and treat it effectively.",

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), narcolepsy is typically associated with cataplexy and/or other REM sleep phenomena such as hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy is not an uncommon disorder, but is under-recognized. The age of onset shows two peaks of presentation: in childhood and in adults. Both genetics and environmental factors may be involved in the development of narcolepsy. The history, combined with polysomnography and MSLT, remain the current gold standard in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The levels of Hypocretin-1 are undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid in most patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Early recognition and treatment can greatly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy. Treatment of narcolepsy includes non-pharmacological treatment (life style changes) and pharmacological (stimulants, modafinil, sodium oxybate) against hypersomnia and anticataplectic drugs (antidepressants and sodium oxybate).",

      "abstract": "Absent or markedly reduced REM sleep with cessation of dream recall has been documented in numerous neurological disorders associated with subcortical dementia including Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and Huntington's chorea. This report concerns a 69 year old Parkinsonian patient who experienced complete cessation of dreaming since the onset of motor disability 13 years ago. Long term treatment with levodopa and dopamine (DA) receptor agonists (bromocriptine and pergolide mesylate) did not affect dream recall. However, dreaming was restored after the patient received three treatment sessions with AC pulsed picotesla range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) applied extracranial over three successive days. Six months later, during which time the patient received 3 additional treatment sessions with EMFs, he reported dreaming vividly with intense colored visual imagery almost every night with some of the dreams having sexual content. In addition, he began to experience hypnagogic imagery prior to the onset of sleep. Cessation of dream recall has been associated with right hemispheric dysfunction and its restoration by treatment with EMFs points to right hemispheric activation, which is supported by improvement in this patient's visual memory known to be subserved by the right temporal lobe. Moreover, since DA neurons activate REM sleep mechanisms and facilitate dream recall, it appears that application of EMFs enhanced DA activity in the mesolimbic system which has been implicated in dream recall. Also, since administration of pineal melatonin has been reported to induce vivid dreams with intense colored visual imagery in normal subjects and narcoleptic patients, it is suggested that enhanced nocturnal melatonin secretion was associated with restoration of dream recall in this patient. These findings demonstrate that unlike chronic levodopa therapy, intermittent pulsed applications of AC picotesla EMFs may induce in Parkinsonism reactivation of reticular-limbic-pineal systems involved in the generation of dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect sleep; children often have difficulty in falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and sleep less than their typically developing peers. ‘Sleep problems’ were found in 53% of over 300 children with autism, compared with 44% of 63 children with delayed development, and 32% of 163 children with normal (typical) development.1 Sleep problems arise from complex interactions between biological, psychological, social, family and cultural factors. Circadian sleep rhythm disorders (CSRD) may be acute but are more often chronic, and frequently result in associated health problems. CSRDs usually exacerbate any pre-existing learning and behavioural difficulties, and may affect the entire family's whole health and well-being and impair their ability to continue in employment or further education.\n\nThere is considerable pressure for both parents and paediatricians to try and improve a child's disturbed sleep. Management options include behavioural, or pharmacological, or both. Behavioural interventions are probably undervalued, but may be difficult to implement, and may take weeks or months to show any benefit. Conventional medications including hypnotics and sedatives are frequently associated with unacceptable day-time sedation that may adversely affect the child's quality of life. The past 20 years have witnessed the introduction of melatonin which continues to be increasingly prescribed to many children both with and without neurodevelopmental disorders and using a wide range of doses.

There is a concept that even food stands next to sleep for a human's life. Sleep plays a major role in human life for the proper functioning of the brain. Any disturbances in sleep for prolonged duration or period may create serious effects in the body and its functioning. Sleeplessness is known clinically as insomnia, a sleep-related disorder wherein the affected people have problems in sleeping. They may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep as long as desired. Hypersomnia, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder of excessive times spent sleeping or excessive sleep. It can have many possible causes and problems with functioning. The study setting is done using online Google forms, including 100 participants. The sampling method is a random sampling method. Well-structured questionnaires were prepared and circulated among those 100 participants. According to the results, 74% of the adults who took the survey are aware that insomnia is sleeplessness. More than 50% of the adults feel that insomnia and hypersomnia lead to death, and 53% of the adults believe that insomnia and hypersomnia are age-related. It can be concluded that awareness of such sleep disorders can be helpful for future generations.",

Detailed enquiry revealed the “hallucinations” to be “whooshing” noises in her ears precipitated by standing. She was found to have a haemoglobin level of 55 g/l, attributed to a combination of poor diet and menorrhagia. Periodic, anaemic, cerebral hypoxia could be proposed to be the root of most, if not all, of the symptoms, illustrating the importance of marrying physical and psychological history taking with suitable investigations for an eminently treatable condition.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a common problem among children beginning school and may be associated both with impaired school performance and with behavioral difficulties. Because these disorders manifest themselves highly variably among children of any given age, and even in an individual affected child, they need an appropriate diagnostic evaluation so that the many environmental and background factors that may be relevant to the further course of the problem can be assessed.Extensive data were obtained on approximately 1400 children who were tested before beginning school in 2005 by means of a special sleep questionnaire and another screening instrument that is used to assess behavioral strengths and difficulties (the SDQ, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).Five percent of the children were found to have difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or nocturnal awakening. Less frequent problems included parasomnias such as pavor nocturnus (0.5%), sleepwalking (0.1%), and frequent nightmares (1.7%).Sleep disorders increase the risk of daytime fatigue and of psychological problems in general, including both hyperactivity and excessive emotional stress. These results imply that sleep problems and emotional disturbances are intimately connected and underscore the importance of diagnosing sleep problems in young children.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep disturbance was identified as one of the main characteristics and biological markers of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

Mental content is generated throughout the day and into the night, moving forward predictably at times but surprisingly at others. Understanding what influences the trajectory of thought—how thoughts continuously unfold over time—has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of thought disorders like schizophrenia and recurrent nightmares. Here, we examine whether cognitive control restricts moment-to-moment content shifts across sleep and wakefulness, thus acting as a fundamental constraint on thought variability. Thought variability was measured as the semantic incoherence between sequential thought phrases and was applied to independent datasets of dreaming and waking reports. Our results show that within both sleeping and waking reports, conditions typically marked by higher levels of cognitive control were associated with decreased thought variability (i.e., semantic incoherence). During wakefulness, on-task conditions were associated with reduced levels of thought variability compared to off-task conditions, and thought variability was greater when thoughts wandered around more freely. During sleep, lucid dreams, marked by higher levels of cognitive control, were associated with reduced levels of thought variability compared to non-lucid dreams. Together, these results suggest that cognitive control may limit thought variability across the 24-hour cycle of thought generation. Such findings are consistent with the Dynamic Framework of Thought, where mental states are expected to vary on a continuum of deliberate constraints, with lower cognitive control leading to a categorical cluster of spontaneous thought processes that includes both mind-wandering during wakefulness and non-lucid dreams during sleep. This observation has broad implications for models of cognition, specifically highlighting the continuity of cognitive processes throughout the circadian cycle and the importance of considering varying levels of thought constraint in both waking and dreaming states.",

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital body function, regulating several biological phenomena. Deprivation studies are one of the ways used to examine the physiological functions and the regulation of the sleep. Sleep deprivation is a stressor, and its’ effects depend on an individual’s prior sleep deficit and distribution during the day. Sleep deprivation can be partial, total, acute, or chronic or specifically focused on one of the sleep phases. Sleep deprivation affects a large spectrum of vital systems such as thermoregulation, energy and mineral balance, and immunofunction. Based on the fact that sleep is a very important process for the normal development of many metabolic pathways, it is logical to think that insomnia has serious organism consequences. Functional irregularities of different organs are always reflected in structural changes that can be identified with imaging techniques. Imaging methods can also help identify problems of animals insomnia.",

Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Ubiquitous Health Monitoring System for Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea With Zigbee Network and Wireless LAN",
      "abstract": "The Greek word “apnea” literally means “without breath.” The three types of apnea are obstructive, central, and mixed. Obstructive is the most common type. Despite the difference in the root cause of the three types of apnea, people with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night and often for 1 min or longer. Sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases, memory problems, weight gain, impotency, and headaches. Sleep apnea may be responsible for job impairment and motor vehicle accidents. Apart from the physical health risks, sleep apnea can lead to social problems when left undiagnosed or untreated such as a high amount of unnecessary health care cost. Sleep disorder is diagnosed with polysomnography, an overnight sleep study, by monitoring electrical activity of brain, heart, eye movement, muscle activity, breathing pattern, and other physiological signals. Because polysomnography requires overnight monitoring by a sleep technologist with full sleep staging, polysomnography is expensive, inconvenient, time consuming, and labor intensive. Although some systems provide home based diagnosis, most systems record the sleep data in a memory card. The patient must send the memory card to a medical center through the mail or internet. The real-time monitoring is not performed and a patient can experience life threatening episodes by not receiving proper feedback from a medical center or a physician. We propose a wireless health monitoring system to diagnose sleep apnea, which enables the global monitoring of biomedical signals. A patient does not need hospitalization and can be diagnosed and receive feedback at home. The system supports monitoring five different biomedical signals to diagnose sleep apnea: electrocardiogram with dry electrodes (no gel), body position, nasal airflow, abdomen/chest efforts and oxygen saturation. The system consists of three units: a wireless transmitter, a wireless receiver, and a monitoring unit. A wireless transmitter unit sends the measured signals from sensors to a receiver unit with Zigbee communication. The receiver unit, which has two wireless modules, Zigbee and Wi-Fi, receives signals from the transmitter unit and retransmits signals to the remote monitoring system with Zigbee and Wi-Fi communication, respectively. By using both the Zigbee network and wireless LAN, the system can achieve low power consumption in a local monitoring area with the feature of the Zigbee standard. The system also provides wide data coverage and easily extends its sensor network to the Internet with the Wi-Fi standard. The features of the system and the results of the continuous monitoring of vital signals are presented.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic central sleep apnea (ICSA) is categorized as a type of nonhypercapnic central sleep apnea (CSA). Recurrent cessation and resumption of respiration leads to sleep fragmentation, which causes excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or both. ICSA has been described in the adult population but there is limited information in children. The purpose of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and polysomnographic findings in children with ICSA.A retrospective review of medical records and polysomnograms was performed for 14 pediatric patients with ICSA, 9 from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and 5 from Antwerp University Hospital. Polysomnographic features of patients with ICSA were compared with those of nine age-matched control group subjects. Patients with CSA caused by medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use were excluded.Sleep complaints were common in the 14 children with ICSA, including those with sleep-onset insomnia (7 children), frequent nighttime awakening (3 children), restless sleep (7 children), and daytime sleepiness (5 children). Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing were noted in 11 of 14 subjects. Compared to that of the control group, sleep latency in the ICSA group was significantly prolonged (P < .05). The percentage of stage 2 sleep was significantly higher (P < .05), and slow wave sleep was significantly lower in patients with ICSA (P < .05).Similar to adult patients, children with ICSA present with complaints of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Analysis of polysomnograms reveals prolonged sleep latency, increased stage 2 sleep, and decreased slow wave sleep. Further studies are needed to assess mechanisms and the role of hypercapnic response in the pathogenesis of children with ICSA.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– Thirty‐seven, out of a sample of 100 elderly subjects, all suffering from dementia, were found to have delusions. The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

      "abstract": "• Sleep onset is a powerful physiologic stimulus for growth hormone secretion. Difficulty falling asleep and poor sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms in patients with a major depressive disorder. Much of the disturbance in the sleep electroencephalograms of depressed patients occurs within the first half of the night, the time when growth hormone is usually secreted. Growth hormone secretion was measured during electroencephalographically monitored sleep in 38 patients with a recurrent major depressive disorder and 35 healthy control subjects. Before treatment, depressed patients had a statistically significant reduction in growth hormone secretion during sleep. This reduction, which persisted through treatment and recovery into the drug-free remitted state, may be a trait marker in patients with a recurrent depressive disorder.",

Many measures used to prevent or reduce jet lag are inappropriate or ineffective and some may even be dangerous, such as use of melatonin. One of the most reliable preventive techniques consists of reinforcing social synchronizers by maintaining exposure to sunlight and social activity. Only two drugs currently available on the market can be recommended, i.e. non-benzodiazepinic hypnotics which induce high quality sleep to allow quick recovery and a new time-release caffeine agent which has been shown to prolong psychomotor performance.",

All these 60 patients underwent clinical evaluation and video EEG polysomnography. In 8 out of 60 (13%) patients, sleep apnoea was documented. Five patients had obstructive sleep apnoea, 3 had mixed sleep apnoea and none had pure central sleep apnoea syndrome. Three-fourths of the patients were obese (mean weight 82kg) middle aged males (mean age 46.3 years). The main symptoms encountered were excessive daytime somnolence and snoring. The symptom severity was found to correspond directly with the duration of symptoms as well as obesity. Sleep apnoea syndromes must be seriously considered and documented in all patients complaining of excessive daytime somnolence.",

Hypersomnia can be both a primary (e.g., hypersomnolence disorder) and secondary (e.g., tumors, and head trauma) symptom of disorders. However, its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.We report that three clinical cases with lesions around the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) area showed excessive daytime sleepiness and a prolonged nocturnal sleep lasting more than 20 h per day. Sleep architecture and subjective daytime sleepiness were examined by polysomnography. These cases were presented with stroke, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody associated disorders and neuromyelitis optical spectrum disorder (NMOSD), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions around the PVH area in all these three patients. After treatment of their primary disorders, their excessive sleep decreased as the PVH area recovered.Our findings suggest that the PVH may play an essential role in the occurrence of hypersomnia.",

Furthermore, chronic diseases, chronic pain symptoms, addiction problems as well as recent, psychologically burdening events increase the risk for a depression. If anamnesis or clinical investigation are suggestive for a depression, the patient should be explored systematically with respect to his symptoms. Main symptoms of a depression are depressed mood, loss of enthusiasm and joyfulness as well as depressed motivation and increased fatigability. Further common symptoms are reduced self-confidence, unfounded self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, reduced ability to concentrate, hyperagitation or psychomotor restriction, sleeping disorders as well as loss of appetite.

      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

As many as half of persons over 65 have some complaint relating to sleep. There is a high prevalence of insomnia in the elderly population and elderly patients also frequently suffer from sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movement disorder, circadian rhythm disturbances, narcolepsy, and rapid eye movement behavior disorder. Unfortunately, sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. The aim of this article is to review normal sleep, sleep and the major causes of sleep disturbances in the elderly. Attention has been given to diagnosis and appropriate interventions, since sleep disturbances left untreated can have significant negative impact in terms of life expectancy, general health outcome and quality of life.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are common in neurodegenerative diseases. Disturbed sleep can result in fatigue, irritability, morning headaches, impaired motor and cognitive skills, depression, and daytime somnolence. The major sleep complaints include insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, excessive nocturnal motor activity, circadian sleep–wake rhythm disturbance, and respiratory dysrhythmia. The pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep disturbances may be secondary to direct structural alteration of the sleep–wake generating neurons or from several other indirect mechanisms. At the biochemical level, neurodegenerative diseases may be largely classified as tauopathies, α-synucleinopathies, and other diseases. Overnight polysomnography (PSG), Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and actigraphy are some important diagnostic laboratory tests in the evaluation of sleep disturbances. Management of sleep disturbances is complex and is based primarily on the nature of the sleep disturbance. The clinical profiles, pathogenetic mechanisms, PSG findings, and management issues are discussed here with reference to some common neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is one of the most common clinical syndromes of somnological disorders, including any sleep disorders under sufficient time and appropriate sleeping conditions. Significant sleep disturbances are common in children who enter the intensive care unit. Between 18 and 65 per cent of children aged between 2 and 18 hospitalized in the intensive care unit have a clinical condition of acute confusion, better known as delirium. Sleep fragmentation, reduction of total sleep time, lack of slow, deep sleep and rapid sleep, and shift of sleep time are changes that can also act as insomnia triggers. Their presence worsens the course of the disease in the patient, prolongs the hospital stay, and increases the risk of complications and lethality. Circadian sleep disorder is a condition that requires close monitoring. Although insomnia therapy approaches are not yet reliable, early diagnosis of insomnia can reduce the duration of the delirium. Sleep assessment includes questionnaires and diaries. However, it was recognized that, despite the difficulties in implementing and interpreting polysomnography, it was still a gold standard for more accurate detection of changes in sleep phases and the difference between normal and abnormal sleep. In the absence of a polysomnograph, it is permissible to use a prolonged video assisted EEG. The inventive multimodal video-assisted monitoring method makes it possible to diagnose sleep disorders, pain syndrome and differential diagnosis of apnoea with cardiac and conductivity disorders or abnormal brain activity, including the presence of sub-clinical convulsions in patients of high-risk groups using a safe and non-invasive method for analyzing trends in the total bioelectric activity of different biological structures of a child. The validation of questionnaires according to the age of the child is also an important step in the timely diagnosis of sleep disorders in older children.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Although central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH) and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently comorbid, they often remain underdiagnosed, leading to insufficient treatment and sociopsychological outcomes. Case Presentation Here, we present a case of a male in his late 20s with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder who exhibited symptoms suggestive of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), a subtype of CDH. The patient experienced difficulty waking up and dropped out of university. Additionally, although methylphenidate extended‐release was prescribed, he often forgot to take his medication, resulting in difficulty waking up until late afternoon. No symptoms related to rapid eye movements sleep were observed. Considering the possibility of concurrent hypersomnia with neurodevelopmental disorders, we conducted 24‐h polysomnography (PSG). The results demonstrated total sleep time of 774.5 min (≥660 min). Together with other criteria, we diagnosed him as having IH. Following discharge and discussion with the patient, we provided sleep hygiene education for him, and he resumed day care attendance to establish a social routine. Conclusion In cases where hypersomnia may co‐occur with neurodevelopmental disorders, active utilization of 24‐h PSG enables detailed evaluation of sleep–wake patterns and behaviors, facilitating effective guidance on sleep hygiene and promoting improvements in social rhythms and sociability.",

Primitive reflexes develop in the womb, are present at birth in the full-term neonate. Postural reflexes emerge after birth and take up to three and a half years to be fully developed. Collectively, abnormality in the profile of these two groups of reflexes provides indications of neurological dysfunction or neurological immaturity. Spinal reflexes function at the base of the hierarchical control system. A weak or absent Moro reflex is seen in cases of upper motor neuron lesions; an asymmetrical Moro reflex at birth may indicate a fractured clavicle or an Erb's palsy. The fear paralysis reflex is a highly alert but immobile state involving one or several following physical changes.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone is essential for the growth and maturation of many target tissues, including the brain and skeleton. As a result, abnormalities of thyroid gland function in infancy and childhood result not only in the metabolic consequences of thyroid dysfunction seen in adult patients, but in unique effects on the growth and /or maturation of these thyroid hormone-dependent tissues as well. In most instances, there are critical windows of time for thyroid hormone-dependent development and so the specific clinical consequence of thyroid dysfunction depends on the age of the infant or child. For example, newborn infants with congenital hypothyroidism frequently have hyperbilirubinemia, and delayed skeletal maturation, reflecting immaturity of liver and bone, respectively, and they are at risk of permanent mental retardation if thyroid hormone therapy is delayed or inadequate; their size at birth, however, is normal. In contrast, hypothyroidism that develops after the age of three years (when most thyroid hormone-dependent brain development is complete) is characterized predominantly by a deceleration in linear growth and skeletal maturation but there is no permanent effect on cognitive development. In general, infants with severe defects in thyroid gland development or inborn errors of thyroid hormonogenesis present in infancy whereas babies with less severe defects or acquired abnormalities, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, present later in childhood and adolescence. In the newborn infant , thyroid function is influenced not only by the neonate ’ s own thyroid gland but by the transplacental passage from the mother of factors that affect the fetal thyroid gland.",

In particular, the patients develop frequent and sudden sleep episodes during the day, and wakefulness episodes during night. A striking feature of the illness is represented SOREM (sleep onset rapid eye movement) episodes, in which the patients go directly from wakefulness to REM sleep without passing through non-REM sleep. Similar alterations have been found in Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected rats, and we are now documenting a relatively early onset of SOREM episodes during the experimental infection. In trypanosome-infected rats, the number of SOREM episodes increases over time and reaches a peak which is coincident with intrusion of sleep into wakefulness and vice versa. We are currently investigating whether the latter changes can help in disease staging by revealing parasite passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and invasion of the brain parenchyma.",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

In contrast to OSA, primary snoring is not associated with any gas exchange abnormalities or sleep disruption. In children, obstructive respiratory events are rare and primary snoring is defined as < 1 event/hr of total sleep time, with mild OSA defined as between 1 and 5 events/hr, a frequency much lower than used in adults. SBD is extremely common in children; however, the majority of children have mild disease, with over a third of pre-school children being reported to snore by their parents [1] and over 15% of elementary school aged children having primary snoring confirmed by the gold standard of polysomnography [2]. Parents and clinicians are usually only concerned about moderate to severe OSA (> 5 events/hr), and primary snoring and mild OSA have been considered benign, and something that does not need to be treated. Sleep disruption and/or hypoxia/hypercapnea and/or swings in intrathoracic pressure are the features of OSA thought to underpin the adverse effects associated with this condition. However, all severities of childhood SDB, including primary snoring, have been shown to have detrimental effects on daytime behavior, learning, and quality of life [3–5], with the majority of previous studies not finding a good correlation between SDB severity assessed by polysomnography and outcomes.",

In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

The highest incidence is 67% in elders in China. It has been proved that SAS is not only related to the development of over 20 kinds of cerebrovascular diseases but also closely related to mental illness,sexual disease,reproductive disease,cancer,obesity,and many other diseases.In addition,the recent studies found that SAS can increase the incidence of Alzheimer disease. Due to chronic hypoxia,patients wake up again and again and the normal sleep law and cycle is broken,and it is difficult to enter or maintain a deep sleep state. They awake tired with listlessness and memory loss. If correction cannot be obtained for a long time,changes in character,behavior,psychological and social adaptation ability and the decrease of the quality of life will occur. Based on the different mechanism and manifestations,the treatments are also different. Choosing the right treatment is very important for prevention and treatment of the chronic disease and the improvement of life quality.",

      "abstract": "We present a case of recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis in a 52-year-old male of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recurrent sleep paralysis is a widely under-reported yet worrisome symptom of various sleep disorders. Although a benign condition in most cases, sleep paralysis in a minority of patients causes great distress. Some patients exhibit bedroom avoidance behavior, whereas others experience bedtime anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. This leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which can greatly impact a person's overall health. As in our case, this led to a vicious \"lack of sleep\" cycle where a patient who had bedtime anxiety and could not fall asleep, owing to his recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, also had poor quality sleep secondary to his OSA. This increases morbidity and has many potential consequences, which may include cardiovascular events, cognitive decline, and motor vehicular accidents. Sometimes, simply addressing the underlying medical condition cures the recurrent sleep paralysis as in this case where continuous positive airway pressure for OSA cured the recurrent sleep paralysis. One of our goals is to raise awareness of recurrent sleep paralysis so that patients can seek medical help and would not have to live with the anguish of the condition. Coming forward will also assist medical researchers in furthering their understanding of sleep paralysis.",

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

There seemed to be no psychiatric symptom-complex common to lipodystrophy, aside from self-consciousness and the tendency to share in the alarm of friends and relatives. Psychiatric symptoms when present seemed on the whole to be psychoneurotic. No constant neurologic symptoms or signs were observed accompanying lipodystrophy. Although weakness is a usual symptom at one stage or another of lipodystrophy, no general symptom-complex or diseases can be considered closely related to it until more cases are available for study. Nervous symptoms in all cases resulting from self-consciousness over personal appearance are not constantly present. No conclusive evidence has been collected to support the theory that the integrity of the nervous system is affected by the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption. Even though the role of sleep disturbances is not still adequately understood, they may be related to metabolic, immune, neurological and respiratory dysfunction and could worsen the quality of life after discharge. A harsh ICU environment, underlying disease, mechanical ventilation, pain and drugs are the main reasons that underlie sleep disruption in the critically ill. Polysomnography is the gold standard in evaluating sleep, but it is not feasible in clinical practice; therefore, other objective (bispectral index score [BIS] and actigraphy) and subjective (nurse and patient assessment) methods have been proposed, but their adequacy in ICU patients is not clear. Frequent evaluation of neurological status with validated tools is necessary to avoid excessive or prolonged sedation in order to better titrate patient-focused therapy. Hypnotic agents like benzodiazepines can increase total sleep time, but they alter the physiological progression of sleep phases, and decrease the time spent in the most restorative phases compared to the phases normally mediated by melatonin; melatonin production is decreased in critically ill patients, and as such, exogenous melatonin supplementation may improve sleep quality. Sleep disruption and the development of delirium are frequently related, both because of sleep scarcity and inappropriate dosing with sedatives. Delirium is strongly related to increased ICU morbidity and mortality, thus the resolution of sleep disruption could significantly contribute to improved ICU outcomes. An early evaluation of delirium is strongly recommended because of the potential to resolve the underlying causes or to begin an appropriate therapy. Further studies are needed on the effects of strategies to promote sleep and on the evaluation of better sleep in clinical outcomes, particularly on the development of delirium.",

      "title": "Obesity and sleep disturbances: Meaningful sub-typing of obesity",
      "abstract": "Obesity, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and self-reported short sleep duration appear to be on the rise, while there is evidence that obesity and these sleep disorders are strongly connected. In this paper, we review data that challenge the common belief that the sleep apnoea and sleep loss, frequently associated with obesity, are the primary determinants of obesity-related objective daytime sleepiness and subjective fatigue (tiredness without increased sleep propensity). Specifically, obesity is associated with objective and subjective EDS regardless of the presence of sleep apnoea. The association between obesity and EDS was confirmed in recent studies of large random samples of the general population or clinical samples, which showed that the primary determinants of subjective EDS were depression, metabolic disturbances, i.e. obesity/diabetes and insulin resistance, and lack of physical activity, and, secondarily, sleep apnoea or sleep loss. Paradoxically, within the obese, with or without sleep apnoea, those who slept objectively better at night are sleepier (objectively) during the day than those who slept worse. The distinguishing factor between those that slept better vs. those that slept worse appears to be level of emotional stress. Furthermore, many studies reported that obesity is associated with self-reported short sleep duration; however, it appears that short sleep duration is a marker of emotional stress rather than a reflection of true sleep loss. Based on these data, we propose that obesity-related deeper sleep and objective EDS are primarily related to metabolic disturbances, whereas obesity-related poorer sleep and subjective fatigue appear to be the result of psychological distress. Furthermore, based on data from studies in normal controls and patients with sleep disorders, it appears that the interaction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and pro-inflammatory cytokines determines the level of sleep/arousal within the 24-hour cycle, i.e. \"eucortisolemia\" or \"hypocortisolemia\" plus hypercytokinemia is associated with high sleep efficiency and objective sleepiness, whereas \"hypercortisolemia\" plus hypercytokinemia is associated with low sleep efficiency and fatigue. In conclusion, we propose that the above-reviewed data provide the basis for a meaningful phenotypic and pathophysiologic sub-typing of obesity. One subtype is associated with emotional distress, poor sleep, fatigue, HPA axis \"hyperactivity,\" and hypercytokinemia while the other is associated with non-distress, better sleep but more sleepiness, HPA axis \"normo or hypoactivity,\" and hypercytokinemia. This proposed sub-typing may lead to novel, preventive and therapeutic strategies for obesity and its associated sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Acute psychosis as the presenting manifestation of lupus: case reports",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE) is present among 28–40% of the SLE patients. Psychosis is rarely the only initial symptom of lupus, as neuropsychiatric lupus is often associated with systemic activity. We present two cases of young ladies presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and further diagnosed with SLE disease. Case reports: Case 1 A 20-year-old female, unmarried, presented to the Psychology Department with acute behavioral abnormality associated with staring, insomnia and, aggressive behavior, hearing voices for the last 3 days. No other psychiatric or neurological symptoms; she was taking 20 mg oral prednisolone prescribed according to a history of fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, pain in almost all joints, and myalgia for the last 1 month. There was no sign of focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Examination of other systems did not find any clinical abnormality except for the presence of photosensitivity. A psychiatric consultation was ordered. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 3200 cell/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), C-reactive protein (CRP) 65 mg/l ( n ≤6), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm/h(range=0–20). anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile which was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with anti-ds-DNA positive (+), decreased C3 and C4. The diagnosis of SLE was done according to the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (EULAR/ACR Criteria). Case2 A 37-year-old married female with 3 children presented to the Psychology Department with disorientation, staring, hearing voices, seeing images of people who want to hurt her, refusing to respond to people, and insomnia for the last 10 days. She had complained of fatigue and low-grade fever for last month. A psychiatric consultation was ordered, and the patient was managed with an injection of haloperidol 5 mg BD. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 7300 cells/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 8.7 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), reticulocyte:1.4, CRP 7 mg/l ( n ≤6), and ESR 50mm/h (range=0–20). The ANA profile was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with the anti-ds-DNA negative (−), decreased C3, and normal C4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high white matter signal around the lateral ventricles and in the semi-oval centers. Mild dilation of the lateral ventricles and slight elevation of the left insular and medial temporal lobe signal. Conclusion: Our case reports showed that organic disorders should be considered while evaluating acute psychosis, especially autoimmune disorders. The presence of laboratory features like anemia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP should be taken with utmost importance.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

The prodromal symptoms of discomfort and the subsequent loss of consciousness occurred while the patient was in bed or got up to go to the toilet due to abdominal symptoms. The onset in supine position was misleading, since this is a well-known alarm symptom of a possible cardiac cause. The second patient had vasovagal syncope followed by a psychogenic pseudosyncope.

      "abstract": "Summary and Conclusions A survey of the sleep pattern change of 87 women patients admitted to an acute psychiatric ward of the Ontario Hospital, Toronto was reported. An alteration of sleep pattern is common to all psychiatric diagnostic categories and the specific symptoms of Evening Insomnia, Morning Insomnia, Frequent Wakening, Light Sleep, Sleep during the Day and Shortening of the total Sleep time is common to all of them. Evening insomnia, light sleep and shortness of sleep are related to the estimated severity of depression while evening insomnia alone was related to the estimated anxiety level. A total increase in sleep symptoms is related significantly to both the estimated depth of depression and the estimated height of anxiety. Shortening of the sleep time and evening insomnia are significantly increased in suicidal patients although changes in the quantity of dreams and increases of nightmares was not. The total sleep symptom score failed to achieve a level of significance. A change in the quantity of dreaming was related to the diagnosis of depression, especially psychotic depression, but not to depression depth, anxiety level, suicidal tendencies or age. Nightmares increased with a diagnosis of psychotic or neurotic depression, with the estimated level of depression but not with the estimated anxiety level or suicidal tendency. Nightmares significantly decrease with age. The factors of anxiety and depressive affect, suicidal tendencies and other like parameters may promise a more significant relationship to sleep disorder than the diagnostic category. The recall of dreams appears to be of more importance for the diagnostic categorization of depressive states than other sleep symptoms.",

NPD is characterized by sudden arousal followed by motor agitation with dystonic posturing, and semipurposeful activity recurring several times per night. When short-lasting, NPD may respond favorably to carbamazepine. ENWs are unusual episodes of ambulation, with unintelligible speech, screaming, and complex, often violent, behavior that responds to anticonvulsants. In both short-lasting NPD and ENWs, electroencephalography may show some evidence of epilepsy; NPD is clinically similar to the frontal lobe seizures that arise mesially or in depth. Paroxysmal arousals (PAs) are even shorter episodes of arousal or awakening during nonrapid eye movement sleep, associated with transient dystonic posturing and related to the short-lasting NPD. PAs, short-lasting NPD, and ENWs probably represent a spectrum of peculiar sleep-related epileptic seizures.",

In order to manage insomnia, correction of a poor sleep environment is of primary importance. We now have many good GABA A receptor agonists such as benzodiazepines and cyclopyrrolones (zopiclone) for use as hypnotics, but to achieve improvements in nocturnal sleep and restoration of daytime functions, short- or ultra-short acting hypnotics are recommended. Zopiclone has been reported to show weaker effects on sleep architecture than other benzodiazepines and does not exacerbate mild or moderate sleep apnea syndrome. Some patients are therapeutic-dose dependent on hypnotics or anxiolytics without showing detectable side effects. It may be possible for some insomniacs, particularly forelderly people, to use the minimum necessary dose of hypnotics to achieve good sleep and live a happy life from the standpoint of good quality of life.",

Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

A la suite des observations fortuites de Schulte, des séries systématiques et contrôlées ont défini le cadre et les limites de l’efficacité de la PTS et diverses investigations biologiques ont cherché à identifier des variables prédictives de son activité. La PTS apporte une amélioration dans environ 60% des cas, plus régulièrement dans les formes endogènes et lorsqu’il y a des variations diurnes de l’humeur. Cette amélioration est globale et elle apparaît le plus souvent aux heures de l’aube mais elle est transitoire, le bénéfice étant perdu au lendemain de la nuit de récupération d’où la nécessité de répéter la privation ou d’y associer une chimiothérapie antidépressive. Les investigations neurobiologiques situent la réponse clinique en rapport avec diverses modifications sur les paramétres catécholaminergiques et neuro-endocriniens ainsi que sur la structuration du sommeil. L’activation thymique se corrèle avec une facilité relative à maintenir l’éveil et se manifeste à un horaire particulier qui correspond à une époque circadienne critique.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnolence associated with cognitive dysfunction, altered perception, hyperphagia, hypersexuality and disinhibited behaviors. Between episodes there is typically a return to normal alertness and cognitive function. Patients with chronic hypersomnia presentations in KLS are less common. Report of case We describe a 23 year old male with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and early-onset bipolar disorder (age 4). At age 16, he sought care after missing five months of school due to periods of severe somnolence sleeping 12-13 hours daily. He presented to the hospital on three occasions with episodes of hypersomnia, lethargy, bradycardia, and hypotension. Brain MRI, toxicology, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and an echocardiogram were unremarkable. Polysomnography (PSG) revealed mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI: 8 events/hr), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) showed a mean sleep latency of 5.8 min and 3 SOREMPs. He was unable to tolerate modafinil due to tremors, mood disturbance and, aggression. Eventually, he was diagnosed with KLS following a 3-day episode of hypersomnolence during which he was unarousable. Partial symptomatic improvement was achieved with clarithromycin and minocycline but residual hypersomnia was still debilitating. Due to inability to stay awake at school, he was enrolled in virtual high school. Despite this, he was unable to complete high school. He has become socially withdrawn and lost many of his friends. A year later, following the initiation of clarithromycin treatment, his wakefulness increased to 8 hours per day. However, symptoms worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic leading to an increased dosing with minimal effect. Despite treatment, he continued to experience episodes of hypersomnia lasting months at a time where he sleeps up to 18 hours daily. Severe weight loss (BMI: 17.0) has occurred due to limited wakeful hours and loss of appetite. Conclusion While still within the expected decade of symptom resolution in chronic KLS, he shows atypical features: persistence hypersomnolence in between episodes, significant weight loss causing failure to thrive, and social withdrawal leading to depression. Multidisciplinary management is crucial to address his complex clinical presentation of KLS and enhance his quality of life. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract Sleep disorders can be divided into those producing insomnia, those causing daytime sleepiness, and those disrupting sleep. Transient insomnia is extremely common, afflicting up to 80% of the population. Chronic insomnia affects 15% of the population. Benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat insomnia; however, there may be a withdrawal syndrome with rapid eye movement (REM) rebound. Two newer benzodiazepine-like agents, zolpidem and zaleplon, have fewer side effects, yet good efficacy. Other agents for insomnia include sedating antidepressants and over-the-counter sleep products (sedating antihistamines). Nonpharmacologic behavioral methods may also have therapeutic benefit. An understanding of the electrophysiologic and neurochemical correlates of the stages of sleep is useful in defining and understanding sleep disorders. Excessive daytime sleepiness is often associated with obstructive sleep apnea or depression. Medications, including amphetamines, may be used to induce daytime alertness. Parasomnias include disorders of arousal and of REM sleep. Chronic medical illnesses can become symptomatic during specific sleep stages. Many medications affect sleep stages and can thus cause sleep disorders or exacerbate the effect of chronic illnesses on sleep. Conversely, medications may be used therapeutically for specific sleep disorders. For example, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder may be treated with dopamine agonists. An understanding of the disorders of sleep and the effects of medications is required for the appropriate use of medications affecting sleep.",

      "abstract": "Review of epidemiological and clinical studies suggests that sleep disorders are disproportionately observed in specific headache diagnoses (eg, migraine, tension-type, cluster) and other nonspecific headache patterns (ie, chronic daily headache, \"awakening\" or morning headache). Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are of varied types, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. Headache, particularly morning headache and chronic headache, may be consequent to, or aggravated by, a sleep disorder, and management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache. Sleep-disordered breathing is the best example of this relationship. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Depression and anxiety are comorbid with both headache and sleep disorders (especially insomnia) and consideration of the full headache-sleep-affective symptom constellation may yield opportunities to maximize treatment. This paper reviews the comorbidity of headache and sleep disorders (including coexisting psychiatric symptoms where available). Clinical implications for headache evaluation are presented. Sleep screening strategies conducive to headache practice are described. Consideration of the spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing is encouraged in the headache population, including awareness of potential upper airway resistance syndrome in headache patients lacking traditional risk factors for OSA. Pharmacologic and behavioral sleep regulation strategies are offered that are also compatible with treatment of primary headache.",

The major causes of excessive daytime sleepiness include pathologic abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia; deficiencies in quality or quantity of sleep, such as those caused by sleep apnea and poor sleep hygiene; disturbances to the body's natural circadian rhythm, such as those caused by shift work or jet lag; and drugs, which can increase sleepiness either therapeutically or as a side effect. Determining the cause of daytime sleepiness is the first step in treating it. Setting appropriate and realistic treatment goals with the patient and initiating treatment are the next steps.

      "title": "Perioperative Hearing Impairment",
      "abstract": "PERIOPERATIVE hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more frequently than most anesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed. 1–3It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent. 4–8Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anesthetic technique. The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anesthesia, 9but other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The etiologies include mechanical, traumatic, noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, nitrous oxide, embolism, pharmacologic, and other miscellaneous causes.The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a snail-shaped structure of 2.75 turns with an uncoiled length of approximately 3 cm (fig. 1). The cochlea is divided into three channels. The two outer channels, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contain perilymphatic fluid and communicate at the apex through the helicotrema. The middle channel, the scala media (cochlear duct), contains endolymphatic fluid. In the conventional cross-sectional view of the cochlea (fig. 2), the scala media is triangular in shape. Its upper boundary, the vestibular or Reissner's membrane, attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and to the outer wall of the cochlea, separating it from the scala vestibuli. The lower boundary, the basilar membrane, also attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The basilar membrane supports the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, and separates the scala media from the scala tympani. The lateral wall of the scala media is the highly vascular stria vascularis. At the base of the cochlea, the perilymph of the scala vestibuli contacts the oval window and the perilymph of the scala tympani contacts the round window (figs. 1 and 3).Arterial blood is supplied to the inner ear by the internal auditory artery, which arises from either the basilar or the inferior anterior cerebellar artery and passes through the internal auditory meatus with cranial nerve VIII. The arterial supply to the cochlea is via end vessels, with no collateral circulation. The afferent special somatic exteroceptive cochlear nerve provides innervation. The peripheral processes arise in the organ of Corti, their cell bodies forming the spiral ganglion of the cochlea in the osseous spiral lamina. The processes converge, traversing the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, which passes through the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibular nerve. A smaller number of efferent nerve fibers arise from the olivary complexes and terminate axodendritically on the afferent dendrites that innervate the inner hair cells.The cochlear fluid system is made up of two fluids, perilymph and endolymph (fig. 2). Perilymph fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and has an ionic composition, low in potassium and high in sodium, similar to interstitial fluid and nearly identical to CSF. 10There are two theories regarding its origin: (1) it is filtrate produced by capillaries in the spiral ligament; and (2) it is CSF communicated to cochlea through the cochlear aqueduct, a small channel in the temporal bone near the round window, which connects the scala tympani directly to the subarachnoid space. The endolymphatic fluid is unique to the inner ear. It has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, similar to intracellular fluid. The stria vascularis is believed to be the source of the unique endolymph ionic composition. Although there is slow longitudinal flow of endolymph, maintenance of the critical ionic environment for the organ of Corti is due to local radial flow between the stria vascularis and nearby cells. Endolymphatic absorption takes place in the endolymphatic sac, a specialized structure of the membranous labyrinth. The endolymphatic sac is located in the subdural space and communicates with the membranous labyrinth via the endolymphatic duct (fig. 1). It is thought to participate in balancing endolymphatic pressures with changes in CSF pressure. Two-way flow through a patent cochlear aqueduct provides relatively rapid perilymphatic pressure equilibration with the CSF. Endolymphatic pressure regulation is considerably slower, being primarily a function of production and absorption. Only minor and temporary pressure adjustments are made by the endolymphatic sac.The organ of Corti, the hearing transduction mechanism, is located in the cochlear duct (scala media). The sensory cells of the organ of Corti are mechanoreceptors with stereocilia projecting from the top of the cells into the endolymph. 11There are two types of hair cells, outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells (fig. 2). They differ in morphology, microanatomical location, and function. The IHCs and OHCs initiate the transduction process by transforming the acoustic signal into neural activity. Activation of the hair cells causes neurotransmitter release that depolarizes afferent dendrites causing an all-or-none spike discharge in individual auditory nerve fibers. Overlying the organ of Corti is a gelatinous flap, the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is attached on its medial edge to the spiral limbus and laterally is in contact with the stereocilia of the OHCs. Since the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane have different medial attachment locations, upward or downward displacement of basilar membrane induces shearing displacements of the hairs in contact with the tectorial membrane. These various bending movements of the OHC stereocilia can cause excitation or inhibition. Excitation initiates the transduction of acoustic energy into neural signals. In contrast to OHCs, the stereocilia of the IHC are not embedded in the tectorial membrane but rest in a groove near the undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The IHC do not respond to displacement of the basilar membrane, but they do respond to the velocity of displacement of the basilar membrane. The neural signals initiated by the IHCs and OHCs are transmitted through the acoustic division of cranial nerve VIII ultimately to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.A simplified diagram of the cochlea uncoiled is usually used to describe cochlear mechanics (fig. 3). On the left is the base of the cochlea with the stapes and oval window. Below these structures and adjoining the scala vestibuli is the round window of the scala tympani. In the diagram, the uncoiled cochlea is divided horizontally by a line representing the scala media, Reissner's membrane, the organ of Corti, and the basilar membrane. However, this line, for purposes of understanding cochlear mechanics, can be thought of as simply the basilar membrane. Above the dividing line is the scala vestibuli, and below is the scala tympani. Because of the inertia of the fluid mass and frictional resistance to fluid flow in the narrow channels of the scala, inward or outward motion of the stapes against the oval window causes a pressure wave to travel down the scala; there is no fluid flow. Since the fluids are incompressible within the bony cochlea, the pressure wave traveling down the scala vestibuli causes the basilar membrane to deflect downward toward the scala tympani for positive pressures and upward for negative pressures. The flexible round window compensates for pressure changes transmitted to the scala tympani. For the acute changes caused by pressure waves in the audible frequencies, the connection between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, the helicotrema, functions as though it were closed. The helicotrema is only involved in very slow equalization of pressures between the two scalae.The most important property of the basilar membrane is its ability to separate various frequencies. The compliance of the basilar membrane changes by a factor of greater than 100 from base to apex. At the base, near the oval window, the basilar membrane is narrower and thicker, making it less compliant (fig. 3). It is wider and thinner at the apex, resulting in greater compliance. Since a system's resonant frequency is directly proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to mass, the stiff base responds maximally to high frequencies (> 4,000 Hz), and the compliant apex responds maximally to low frequencies (< 1,000 Hz). In short, the basilar membrane functions as a sharply tuned bandpass filter, performing a spectral analysis on the incoming sound (pressure) waves. The effect is to translate the frequency of incoming sound into distance along the basilar membrane, a frequency-to-place or tonotopical transformation. Therefore, both IHCs and OHCs at a specific point along the basilar membrane respond to a very specific, narrow frequency range. Excited hair cells depolarize specific acoustic neurons, and the information is finally interpreted in the auditory centers.Clinical or subclinical hearing loss following spinal anesthesia or lumbar puncture has been reported frequently(table 1). 4,6–8,12–24Despite many reports, few anesthesiologists appear to be aware of the possibility of this complication. Since there has been no large-scale audiometric study of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia, the precise incidence of clinical or subclinical hearing loss is unknown but may occur more frequently than appreciated. Further, the specific presentation and onset of the hearing deficit after spinal anesthesia can vary widely.The first case of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia 25was reported in 1914. In 1956, Vandam and Dripps 26reported that of 9,277 patients who had spinal anesthesia, 0.4% experienced auditory difficulties, such as impaired hearing, tinnitus, buzzing, or roaring. Few specific data were gathered, and no audiometry of these patients was performed. Michel et al. 27described nine cases of hearing loss following myelography, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and spinal anesthesia. The hearing deficits were almost uniformly in the lower frequencies (125–1,000 Hz). The deficits were bilateral in six of the nine patients. Six of the nine patients had full recoveries in less than 1 month without treatment.In addition to these case reports, there have been several studies of hearing loss related to spinal anesthesia. In one study, 6 of 14 patients had audiometrically detectable mild hearing deficits in the low-frequency range that resolved spontaneously in 1–7 months. 28Walsted et al. 29tested 34 patients with audiometry before and after spinal anesthesia. Most of the patients had a small but significant threshold shift at 500 Hz. However, one patient developed a considerable unilateral hearing loss in the low-frequency range, which persisted until an epidural blood patch was performed. Gultekin et al. 30used pure tone audiometry to test hearing before and after spinal anesthesia for hernia repair. Fourteen patients (32%), despite being unaware of it, had audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing losses. All spinal anesthetics were performed with 22-gauge Quincke needles (needle gauge and design are discussed in the next section), and the authors suggested that hearing loss was less frequent when the anesthetic agent was bupivacaine rather than prilocaine. In 35 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (24-gauge Sprotte needle), pure tone audiometry revealed that five patients had developed low-frequency hearing loss on the first postoperative day. 31The deficits were unilateral in three patients and bilateral in the other two. All patients had full recovery without treatment by the fifth postoperative day. In contrast, Finegold et al. 32found no audiometric hearing decrement postoperatively in 44 patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Half of the patients' spinals were performed with 25-gauge Quincke needles; 24-gauge Sprotte needles were used for the other half. This is the only study of 13 found that failed to show a relationship between spinal anesthesia and hearing loss. Hearing acuity is affected by hormonal changes, 33,34but peripartum changes have not been documented. The explanation for this singular result may be in the study's methodology.In a study of 100 patients undergoing elective urologic procedures under spinal anesthesia, eight patients experienced noticeable hearing impairment. 18Audiometry was performed on three of the patients and revealed a 30-dB loss in the low-frequency range. Hearing deficits resolved within a short time without treatment. In another study of 100 patients undergoing elective general or urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia, 16 had audiometrically documented hearing losses. 3The hearing loss typically affected only the frequencies between 125 and 2,000 Hz. The deficits were usually detected on the second day after the spinal anesthetic and in all cases resolved within 3 days without treatment. The incidence of hearing loss after spinal anesthesia for men under 30 yr of age was compared to that in men over the age of 60. 35Fifty-two percent (13 of 25) of the younger and 16% of the older patients had significant hearing losses (≤ 10 dB) confined to the low-frequency range (125–500 Hz). There was no hearing impairment in the speech frequencies (500–2,000 Hz) and higher frequencies for either group. No patient was aware of a hearing deficit, and no patient developed a post–dural puncture headache (PDPH). In a recent study of hearing loss following spinal versus general anesthesia, there were audiometric losses in both groups, although the spinal group had significantly greater hearing losses, particularly in the low-frequency range. 36Interestingly, in the spinal group, increases in the low-frequency audible threshold were inversely related to the preoperative low-frequency audible threshold.Overall, it appears that 10–50% of patients receiving spinal anesthesia experience an audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing deficit. Less than one fourth of these patients have a clinical, or noticeable, hearing loss.The size of the needle used for dural puncture appears to play a role in postspinal anesthetic hearing impairment. The hearing loss may be a result of CSF leakage even when the CSF loss is insufficient to cause a PDPH. Fog et al. 2found that 13 of 14 patients whose spinal anesthetics were performed with a 22-gauge needle had a 10-dB or greater hearing loss across the audible frequency range with significantly greater losses in the low-frequency range. Only 4 of the 14 patients in whom a 26-gauge needle was used had similar hearing impairment, and none had significant (> 10 dB) losses. When spinal anesthesia was performed with a 26-gauge needle, 37only one of nine patients was found to have a low-frequency hearing loss, which was severe but transient. Interestingly, this patient also experienced a PDPH. In another study of 100 patients, 50 had spinal anesthesia using either a 20- or a 22-gauge needle. Of these, 10% had significant decreases in audiometric values in the 250- to 500-Hz frequency range on the first postoperative day that resolved spontaneously within 5 days. 38In the 50 patients in whom 24- and 25-gauge needles were used, no decrement in audiometric values occurred. Oncel et al. 1used pure tone audiometry at 125 Hz preoperatively and postoperatively to assess hearing loss. Three groups of 15 patients were studied. One group received epidural anesthesia. In the other two groups, spinal anesthesia was performed with either a 22- or 25-gauge needle. No hearing impairments were detected in the epidural group. There was significantly greater hearing loss in the 22-gauge group versus the 25-gauge spinal group. None of the study patients developed a PDPH. The authors suggested that pure tone audiometry may be a more sensitive indicator of CSF leakage than the presence of PDPH.Needle design may also play a role in hearing impairment following lumbar puncture. Using audiometry, Sundberg et al. 39compared the effect of 22-gauge cutting-tip (Quincke) to 22-gauge pencil-point (Whitacre) needles on postspinal hearing loss. A hearing loss of at least 10 dB at two or more frequencies below 1,000 Hz was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients in the Quincke group as compared to only 2 of 23 (9%) in the Whitacre group. In addition, of those patients with hearing deficits, the mean hearing level was significantly worse in the Quincke group. This study suggests an association between the design of the spinal needle tip and postoperative hearing dysfunction that is similar to the relationship between the needle types and the incidence of PDPH, implying a similar pathogenesis. Lamberg et al. , 40using audiometric testing, compared hearing losses after a single-shot spinal with a 25-gauge Quincke needle with those following a continuous spinal anesthetic (19-gauge Touhy-type needle and 22-gauge catheter). None of the patients developed a PDPH or were aware of a hearing loss. However, nine (43%) of the single-shot patients and seven (37%) of continuous spinal patients had hearing deficits in excess of 10 dB when tested postoperatively. This result also seems to parallel experience with the cause and incidence of PDPH.In summary, hearing impairment following neuraxial anesthesia seems to be related to the same factors (age, needle gauge, and needle type) that are implicated in CSF leakage and PDPH. 41Two of the studies cited above included a total of 27 patients who received epidural anesthesia. Audiometric testing did not reveal measurable postoperative auditory impairment in any of these patients. On the other hand, the consensus of the studies indicates a consistent rate (10–50%) of SNHL in the low frequencies after lumbar puncture. Also, postspinal hearing impairment resolved without treatment, usually within several days, again suggesting an etiology common with that of PDPH. Interestingly, in two reports, patients who received epidural blood patches for PDPH had simultaneous reversal of their postspinal, low-frequency hearing loss. 4,29Cerebrospinal fluid leakage can cause a decrease in the CSF pressure that may be transmitted to the inner ear. A relative balance in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures maintains the normal structural conformation in the inner ear. Disruption of this pressure balance can cause hearing impairment as well as impairment of semicircular canal function. A change in CSF pressure is promptly transmitted through a patent cochlear aqueduct to the inner ear perilymph (fig. 2). 6,42–45A decrease in CSF pressure following a dural puncture and CSF leak would cause a rapid and similar decrease in perilymph pressure. The endolymphatic system, however, responds much more slowly. Endolymphatic pressure–volume adjustments are primarily the result of altered endolymph production at the stria vascularis or altered absorption at the endolymphatic sac. Therefore, an acute drop in CSF pressure could result in endolymphatic pressure sufficiently exceeding that of the perilymph to cause distortions of both Reissner's membrane and the basilar membrane. The consequent disruption in the position of the hair cells results in hearing impairment. 10This mechanism has been postulated in several reports. 3,6,8,46Walsted et al. 47proposed such a mechanism in 1991. Later, in controlled prospective studies of neurosurgical patients and in animal studies, she showed the relationship between CSF loss and low-frequency hearing impairment. 48–52The finding that the degree of hearing impairment is correlated with the size of the spinal needle further supports the theory that postspinal hearing loss and PDPH share a common etiology: leakage of CSF from the subarachnoid space. 1,2Distortion of the basilar membrane and hearing loss could also be caused by acute increases in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph. In a case report, Hardy 53postulated that injection into the epidural space caused an acute increase in CSF pressure that was immediately transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct to the perilymph, thus distorting the basilar membrane and causing an acute low-frequency hypoacusis.Finally, if the mechanism of postspinal hearing loss is the same as for PDPH, several questions arise: why do we not see as many patients with vestibular symptoms; why does not every patient with a severe PDPH experience hearing impairment; and why are some hearing losses unilateral? In response to the first question, not only are the changes in CSF pressure transmitted less rapidly to the vestibular apparatus, but the vestibular apparatus is somewhat less sensitive than the cochlea to perilymph–endolymph pressure imbalances. Further, the hearing deficit may be subclinical, not obvious without audiometric testing. In answer to the second question, as many as 7% of adults have an anatomically obstructed cochlear aqueduct, and as many as 30% have a functionally obstructed aqueduct. 44,45,54For these patients, CSF pressure changes are not transmitted to the perilymph, and, therefore, a severe PDPH could exist without a hearing deficit. This mechanism may also explain the cases of unilateral hearing deficit. In addition, restricted cochlear aqueduct flow and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows can limit the stress of CSF pressure changes.The reports cited above indicate that the great majority of hearing deficits that result from lumbar puncture or CSF loss occur in the low frequencies and, in most cases, bilaterally. We propose that this is the result of the physical characteristics of the basilar membrane. At the cochlear base, where higher frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is narrow, thick, and stiff, and therefore resistant to pressure changes that are not in its resonant frequency range (fig. 3). At the cochlear apex, where low frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is much more compliant. Changes in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph can cause significant static displacement of the basilar membrane, disrupting the normal OHC relationship to the tectorial membrane and resulting in low-frequency hearing loss. Hearing loss confined to the low frequencies is unlikely due to CSF pressure–mediated stretch or pressure injury to cranial nerve VIII.It is interesting to note that the low-frequency hearing loss observed in Ménière's syndrome involves a similar mechanism. In Ménière's syndrome, instead of a decrease in perilymphatic pressure relative to endolymphatic pressure, there is an increase in endolymphatic pressure (endolymphatic hydrops). This imbalance in pressures would cause a similar distortion of the basilar membrane with the greatest effect at the cochlear apex and resulting, at least in the early stages, in a hearing loss (low frequency) similar to that which can occur after spinal anesthesia.Presuming that hearing impairment following spinal anesthesia or dural puncture has the same etiology as PDPH, i.e. , loss of CSF or decreased CSF pressure, then the treatment and prognosis should be similar. Figure 4indicates that untreated hearing impairments following dural puncture recover fully greater than 95% of the time. Several authors have noted improvement in auditory symptoms after an epidural blood patch. 4,29,55Lybecker et al. 46prospectively studied the effects of an epidural blood patch on hearing in patients with severe PDPH caused by dural puncture. They performed audiometry at several frequencies 1 h before and 1 h after an epidural blood patch. Twelve of the 16 patients had significant audiometric improvement in hearing. Simply changing position from sitting to supine improved hearing in half of the patients in the absence of the blood patch. This study offers clear evidence of the potential efficacy of epidural blood patch for post–dural puncture hearing loss. In another case report in which conservative measures followed by two epidural blood patches failed to relieve a severe PDPH and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss, an epidural dextran 40 infusion relieved the headache and reversed the hearing loss. 56Rosenberg et al. 57performed an audiometric study of 20 patients undergoing surgery with interscalene brachial plexus block anesthesia. Four of the patients (20%) experienced hearing impairment at various frequencies on the side of the block. The low frequencies (250–500 Hz) were affected in only one patient who also had hearing threshold decrements on the opposite side of 15–20 dB measured in the 6,000- to 10,000-Hz range (table 2). Farrell et al. 58described four patients with sudden permanent deafness following anesthesia for dental surgery. Anesthesia for three of the patients was local infiltration or nerve block, and the fourth had general anesthesia. The patient who had general anesthesia had bilateral SNHL, while the three other patients had ipsilateral SNHL. Similarly, Shenkman et al. 59reported a case in which permanent neurologic symptoms, ipsilateral hearing impairment, a facial nerve palsy, and ataxia occurred following an inferior alveolar nerve block. These findings are summarized in table 2.Within 24 h after the interscalene blocks, all four of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their hearing deficits. 57The authors postulated that the mechanism of hearing loss involved an effect due to sympathetic blockade. Vasodilation caused by the sympathetic block may have developed, resulting in edema of the mucosal membranes of both the Eustachian tube and the middle ear and producing a hearing decrement on that side. The hearing loss resolved within 24 h without treatment in all four patients.With regard to the hearing deficits following dental procedures, the authors 58,59could not identify a specific etiology for any of the cases. Several possibilities were considered. Noise-induced hearing loss from dental drills is known to result in temporary, noise-induced, bilateral hearing deficits. 60Dental extractions are known to cause microemboli that could reach the cochlear vasculature and cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment. 58Vasoconstrictors are usually used with local anesthesia for dental procedures. Intravascular injection could cause vasospasm of the cochlear division of the internal auditory artery. 58Finally, nociceptive afferents or autonomic nerve fibers could initiate a reflex vasoconstriction of critical vessels to the hearing structures. Hearing loss during dental procedures appears to be quite rare and usually temporary.Hearing impairment after general anesthesia for non–cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is rare. Our review of the English language literature through 2001 revealed only 35 reported (29 documented audiometrically) cases of hearing loss after general anesthesia (table 3).Evan et al. 61reported three cases of SNHL following general anesthesia; one patient recovered, and the other two sustained permanent hearing loss. The authors were unable to elucidate the etiology in any of the patients. Cox and Sargent 62reported three cases of hearing loss following nonotologic surgery. Two patients had permanent, profound unilateral hearing loss, and one patient had moderate bilateral hearing loss. Velazquez 63described a case of acute unilateral hearing deficit following abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Other authors have described bilateral hearing impairment immediately following minor abdominal surgeries. 64,65It should also be noted that some patients who receive general anesthesia come to the operating room from an intensive care unit having already sustained an unrecognized hearing loss. Halpern et al. 66have discussed the myriad causes of hearing loss in the critical care setting.Although the etiology of hearing loss associated with general anesthesia often cannot be ascertained, there are a number of potential etiologies: changes in middle ear pressure, vascular pathology, CSF pressure changes, embolism, ototoxic drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.Excessive or sudden changes in middle ear pressure can disrupt the tympanic membrane, the round window, and the conducting structures. Excessive middle ear pressure can cause the round window to rupture, resulting in significant hearing loss. 67,68This type of injury has been described as occurring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 69Two patients who were successfully resuscitated developed partial deafness, one from disarticulation of the incomalleal joint and the other from an oval window perilymph fistula. It was postulated that during vigorous mask ventilation, excessive pressure was suddenly transmitted through the Eustachian tube causing the middle ear injuries.Nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthesia was shown in the late 1960s to be capable of causing oscillations of middle ear pressures that could result in tympanic perforation and cause hearing loss. 70,71Depending on the uptake or elimination phase, N2O can displace tympanic membrane grafts outward or inward and disrupt reconstructed middle ear conducting structures. Segal et al. 72described a case of labyrinthine membrane rupture and sustained SNHL due to elevated intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. The degree of intratympanic pressure fluctuation is a function of N2O concentration and its rate of change. Several cases of middle ear injury have been described as resulting from sudden changes in intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. 73–77Further, the patency of the Eustachian tube may play a role in potential injury during N2O anesthesia. During N2O elimination, Eustachian tube obstruction can result in significant negative middle ear pressure and tympanic perforation. 78A vascular pathogenesis is another possible mechanism for hearing impairment after general anesthesia.

Three clinical cases with long-standing headaches are presented, one a depression headache patient and two classic migraineurs. All case histories showed a strong relationship between extended sleep duration and headaches, and headaches completely remitted after patients consistently awakened one-half to one hour earlier than their normal rising time. Eight common migraineurs showed no such relationship and failed to respond to sleep manipulations.We conclude that classic migraine and morning onset “muscle contraction” (or depression) headaches may result from serotonergic mechanisms which are triggered by excessive sleep.

Causes include medical diseases, psychiatric disorders, drugs, behavioural factors, circadian dysrhythmias and primary sleep disorders. Insomnia is common, affecting approximately one-third of the total population, and of these about 10% consider it a chronic problem. Insomnia is more common in females and increases with age. Many people with insomnia resort to ineffective or dangerous self-treatment regimens and the combination of alcohol with non-prescription drugs is common. We have carried out a study on 20 patients with Primary Insomnia and were able to demonstrate significant differences in both descriptive and objective EEG data between those with Primary Insomnia and controls. Careful evaluation of the sleep problem and accurate diagnosis are essential in order to choose the right treatment for an individual patient. When a specific problem is identified (psychiatric, physical, behavioural), then the underlying cause needs to be treated. Insomnia can be treated by either non-pharmacological or pharmacological intervention, and often both are used simultaneously. It is recommended that hypnotic treatments should be used for no more than one month.",

Clinicians have to be content with the patients' own assessment of their sleep patterns, or at the best, those of a night nurse; both methods are known to be unreliable, particularly where insomnia is present (Kuper et al. , 1970). In a previous paper, Johnson and Kitching (1972) described a simple device for assessing the duration of sleep in ward situations. It depended upon the patient's ability to signal wakefulness by pressing a mechanical switch in response to an intermittent light stimulus throughout the night. This was considered to indicate a level of cerebral arousal compatible with wakefulness: failure to respond to the light stimulus indicated that the patient's level of cerebral arousal was lowered to the level of ‘sleep‘. A number of objections were anticipated, however, which might invalidate these assumptions. Most important of these were: (i) The intermittent occurrence of the light stimulus, every 15–20 minutes, limits the device to an approximation of the duration of sleep. The system of scoring was to assume a period of 10 minutes of sleep on either side of a missed stimulus. (ii) The possibility that the patient could press the mechanical switch in response to the light stimulus whilst in Stage I or even Stage II of sleep (Rechtschaffen et al. , 1968) without returning to wakefulness. (iii) The intermittent light stimulus might itself act as a disruptive stimulus to sleep, producing arousal and thus altering the sleep level.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade we have witnessed substantial progress towards the understanding of Parkinson's disease. According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

The clinical features include dysaesthesias and paraesthesias in the legs and sometimes in the arms. occurring at rest, worsening in the evening and night and alleviated by movements. Associated symptoms are insomnia, fatigue, sleepiness, mood and anxiety disorders. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features. Neurophysiological investigations, polysomnography and actimeter are used to objectively assess sensory-motor disorders and sleep disturbances. Apart from secondary cases related to neurological or medical diseases, the restless legs syndrome is a primary and idiopathic disorder showing a high rate of familiarity and implying a deficient dopaminergic transmission at spinal level and/or basal ganglia with a selective impairment of D 2 receptors. The additional role of a dysfunction of the brain iron metabolism has been suggested but not defined in detail. Levodopa is an efficacious treatment, but adverse effects, i.e. rebound and augmentation, are frequently described. Dopamine agonists have largely replaced levodopa in moderate to severe restless legs syndrome, while slow-release levodopa is still used in mild cases. Treatment with opiates and gabapentin is proposed for cases not responding to dopamine agonists and/or when pain is the presenting symptom. Iron therapy is recommended only in patients with low level of ferritin.",

These episodes, which lasted several seconds, appeared in short repeated bouts that became worse with fatigue. Results of the neurological exploration, laboratory examinations, neuroimaging (CAT, MRI, brain ultrasonography) and a neurophysiological study, which included EEG-video monitoring and EEG performed during the waking state, were all normal. A nocturnal polysomnographic study was later conducted for 7-8 hours and EEG, EMG and EOG readings were recorded. The trace showed focal or generalised paroxysmal discharges during non-REM sleep in the form of polyspike-wave and spike-wave complexes. Sleep analysis (Reschstaffen and Kales) showed only a shortened REM sleep latency, with no clear clinical meaning. Several cases have been reported in the literature with identical symptoms and normal results in the diagnostic tests, including daytime polysomnography.The appearance of these epileptic anomalies in the nocturnal study makes it necessary to perform a complete nocturnal polysomnography. In spite of these findings, BCPED courses favourably and has a benign prognosis both with and without antiepileptic treatment. We therefore believe that BCPED should be classed within the group of 'benign idiopathic epilepsies of childhood'.",

This results in cessation (apnoea) or reduction (hypopnoea) of airflow, leading to oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. An individual's disposition to develop OSAHS depends on the collapsibility of a segment of the upper airway. The degree of collapsibility can be quantified by the balance between occluding or extraluminal pressures of the surrounding tissues. Patients can experience snoring, unrefreshing sleep, witnessed apnoeas, waking with a choking sensation and excessive daytime sleepiness. OSAHS has a broad range of consequences, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive sequelae. Treatment options include lifestyle measures, in particular weight loss, and strategies to maintain upper airway patency overnight, including continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular advancement devices and positional modifiers.",

At that point, however, the discerning clinician must differentiate prolonged concussion symptoms from the evolution of persistent symptoms from comorbid neurologic conditions or emerging mental health symptoms or disorders.

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica.

      "title": "Neuropeptide S Counteracts Paradoxical Sleep Deprivation-Induced Anxiety-Like Behavior and Sleep Disturbances",
      "abstract": "Disturbed sleep is a common subjective complaint among individuals with anxiety disorders. Sleep deprivation increases general and specific anxiety symptoms among healthy individuals. The amygdala is critical for regulating anxiety and also involved in mediating the effects of emotions on sleep. Neuropeptide S (NPS) and NPS receptors (NPSR) are reported as a novel endogenous arousal and anxiolytic system, but it is unclear yet whether this system is involved in anxiety-like behavior and sleep caused by sleep deprivation, and how it plays anxiolytic effect underlying the comorbid condition. In the present study, we demonstrate that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) induced by modified multiple platform method (MMPM) for 24 h caused anxiety-like behavior, a prolonged sleep latency and subsequent paradoxical sleep (PS) rebound accompanied by an increase in electroencephalogram (EEG) theta (4.5-8.5 Hz) activities across light and dark phase in rats. The increase of PS after PSD was due to an increase of episode number during light phase and both episode number and duration during dark phase. Central action of NPS (1 nmol) attenuated PSD-induced anxiety-like behavior, and altered PSD-induced sleep-wake disturbances through increasing wakefulness, and suppressing PS and EEG theta activities. The reduction in PS time following NPS administration during light phase was because of a decreased episode number. Furthermore, sleep amount in 24 h in PSD rats given NPS was lesser than that given saline. PSD significantly enhanced NPSR mRNA expression level in the amygdala. NPS remarkably increased the number of Fos-ir neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA) and medial amygdala (MeA). The majority of Fos-ir neurons induced by NPS also expressed NPSR. These results suggest that NPSR upregulation in the amygdala is presumably related to the PSD-induced anxiety-like behavior and sleep disturbances, and that NPS counteracts PSD-induced anxiety-like behavior and sleep disturbances possibly through activating the neurons bearing NPSR in the amygdala. In addition, the little sleep increase in PSD rats treated with NPS suggests that NPS can function as an anxiolytic without causing a subsequent sleep rebound.",

      "title": "Sleep less and bite more: Sleep disorders associated with occlusal loads during sleep",
      "abstract": "Occlusal overload during sleep is a significant clinical issue that has negative impacts on the maintenance of teeth and the longevity of dental prostheses. Sleep is usually viewed as an 'out-of-functional' mode for masticatory muscles. However, orodental structures and prostheses are not free from occlusal loads during sleep since masticatory muscles can be activated at a low level within normal sleep continuity. Thus, an increase in masticatory muscle contractions, by whatever the cause, can be associated with a risk of increased occlusal loads during sleep. Among such conditions, sleep bruxism (SB) is a type of sleep-related movement disorders with potential load challenge to the tooth and orofacial structures. Patients with SB usually report frequent tooth grinding noises during sleep and there is a consecutive increase in number and strength of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). Other types of masticatory muscle contractions can be non-specifically activated during sleep, such as brief contractions with tooth tapping, sleep talking, non-rhythmic contractions related to non-specific body movements, etc.; these occur more frequently in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that clinical signs and symptoms of SB can be found in patients with sleep disorders. In addition, sleep becomes compromised with aging process, and a prevalence of most sleep disorders is high in the elderly populations, in which prosthodontic rehabilitations are more required. Therefore, the recognition and understanding of the role of sleep disorders can provide a comprehensive vision for prosthodontic rehabilitations when prosthodontists manage complex orodental cases needing interdisciplinary collaborations between dentistry and sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by continuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis canbe difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially,he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and internal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active temporal focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

These recurrent episodes with agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, sometimes--disorientation and memory loss; appearing simultaneously with hyponatremia (Na in blood 104-118 mEq/L); were classified as organic delusional disturbances, and (in case of disorientation and memory loss) as delirium (F06.2, F05 - in ICD-10). The symptoms were manifested for 6 months and were classified as personality disturbances due to brain dysfunction (F07.8 in ICD 10). The acute psychic disturbances interrupted the hospitalization in the medical ward, twice and caused three psychiatric hospitalizations; until the diagnosis of hyponatremia in the course of inappropriate vasopressin secretion (SIADH), due to small cell carcinoma of the left lung was established.The SIADH syndrome with hyponatremia, and polymorphic psychic disturbances had preceded the clinical and radiological manifestations of the hidden development of left lung small cell carcinoma for a long time. The legitimated involuntary admission to a psychotic ward in a general hospital with easy access to specialized laboratory tests and consultations facilitated establishing the diagnosis. The restriction of water administration with oral salt supplementation stabilized the psychic state and enabled treatment in the Institute of Oncology. The case illustrates the complicated somatic mechanisms of psychic disturbances and the necessity of multi-specialist cooperation in the border area between psychiatry and other medical disciplines.",

      "title": "The Utility of Routine EEG in the Diagnosis of Sleep Disordered Breathing",
      "abstract": "Summary: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common medical condition. Its manifestations of snoring, nocturnal choking, arousals, and sleep fragmentation can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, neuropsychological slowing, lapses of consciousness, and accidents that can be misinterpreted as epileptic phenomena. Moreover, patients with documented epilepsy commonly exhibit similar symptomatology because of the undiagnosed coexistence of sleep apnea. Therefore, a large proportion of patients referred to the electroencephalogram (EEG) laboratory primarily to confirm or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy could suffer from latent sleep apnea and the routine EEG has the potential to divulge it. We retrospectively evaluated the reporting of sleep apnea symptomatology (snoring, choking, gasping/deep breath, apnea, desaturation, excessive drowsiness) in routine inpatient and outpatient adult EEG studies performed in our institution over the past 12 years (39,130 studies, approximately half of which recorded at least early stages of sleep). Comparisons were performed with the medical records to ascertain the coexistence of objectively diagnosed SDB with polysomnography before or after the EEG study and the importance of reporting variations in assisting with the diagnosis. Two illustrative examples are provided. Sixty-nine EEG studies were identified, performed primarily to confirm, or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. The mean age of the subjects at EEG was 64 years (range 30–89), and 55 (80%) were male. 36% of them suffered from known epilepsy. Snoring was the most commonly reported sign in 48 (70%) of the studies, followed by arousals in 29 (42%), apnea in 16 (23%), excessive drowsiness in 13 (19%), gasping/deep breath in 9 (13%), and desaturation in 7 (10%). A sleep disorder was suggested in 25 (36%) of the interpretations and a direct recommendation for a sleep study was made in 22 of them (32%). This interpretation was included in the impression of the report in 21 (30%) of the cases, in the detail in 20 (30%) of the cases and in both in 28 (40%). Only 14 (20%) patients underwent polysomnography, and all of them were formally diagnosed with SDB. Seven (50%) of them were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, 2 (14%) with central sleep apnea, 3 (22%) with both, 1 (7%) with upper airways resistance syndrome, and 1 (7%) with primary snoring. From these 14 patients, 9 (64%) were diagnosed with a sleep study performed after the EEG, 4 (29%) before the EEG interpretation, and 1 (7%) had a repeat study after the EEG. In the logistic regression model applied, with the exception of the presence of arousals (odds ratio = 4.63, P = 0.033), none of the aforementioned symptomatology or the reporting of suspicion for SDB or the location (impression vs. detail) of the reporting showed a statistically significant association with the completion of a sleep study. Routine EEG offers a unique opportunity of direct clinical observation along with electrophysiologic and cardiorespiratory monitoring. When sleep is recorded, it can help identify clinical and electrographic features of sleep apnea and prompt confirmation with a polysomnogram in the appropriate clinical context. It can therefore serve as a valuable, adjunctive tool for the diagnosis of SDB. Our data highlight that potential but unveil its decreased use in the neurology community. Increased awareness is required by the EEG technologists, interpreting neurologists, and referring physicians, regarding reporting and using sleep apnea features on the EEG.",

      "abstract": "Reflex seizures (RS) are epileptic events that are objectively and consistently elicited in response to a specific afferent stimulus or by an activity of the patient. The specific stimulus can be a variety of heterogenous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, ranging from the simple to the complex, such as flashing lights or reading a book. These seizures can take a variety of forms, comprising either general or focal onset, with or without secondary generalization. Reflex epilepsies (RE) are classified as a specific syndrome in which all epileptic seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli. The few designated RE include idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, other visual sensitive epilepsies, primary reading epilepsy, and startle epilepsy. RS that occurs within other focal or generalized epilepsy syndromes that are associated with distinct spontaneous seizures are classified by the overarching seizure type. Most patients experience spontaneous seizures along with their provoked events. RS originate from stimulation of functional anatomic networks normally functioning for physiological activities, that overlap or coincide with regions of cortical hyperexcitability. Generalized RS typically occur within the setting of IGEs and should be considered as focal seizures with quick secondary generalization via cortico-cortical or cortico-reticular pathways. In aggregate, activation of a critical neuronal mass, supported and sustained by cortico-subcortical and thalamocortical pathways eventually result in a seizure. Treatment includes antiseizure medication, commonly valproate or levetiracetam, along with lifestyle modifications, and when amenable, surgical intervention. High clinical suspicion and careful history taking must be employed in all epilepsy patients to identify reflex triggers.",

It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common and most serious mental health problem affecting all age groups, genders, communities throughout the world. It is increasing very rapidly day by day. It is characterised by persistent sadness, and a loss of interest in daily activities that a person normally enjoys, accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities for at least two weeks. In addition, there may be a loss of energy, a change in appetite, changes in sleeping pattern, anxiety, reduced concentration, indecisiveness, restlessness, feeling of worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, thoughts of self-harm and committing suicide. According to WHO report, prevalence of depression is about 5% in general population. Currently more than 300 million people are suffering worldwide from it. It is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents suffering from depression. In Unani perspective, depression is not a disease rather it is a symptom or a group of symptoms of Malenkholiya (Melancholia) in which the mental functions of the individual are disturbed leading to constant grief, fear and uncertain aggression. The patient finds himself/herself isolated and occupied, feels lonely and some patients experience delusion and hallucinations. There is also a change in feelings, mood and behaviour of patient. At times patient becomes overanxious and his thoughts and thinking process gets disturbed. Person suffering from Malenkholiya becomes easily irritable, prefers loneliness and is fearful of usual things. There are a number of factors responsible for depression but Unani scholars consider Ghair Tabayi Sauda (Abnormal black bile) as the main cause of psychological and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, etc. There are different regimens in Unani System of Medicine (USM) for correction of psychiatric disorders (depression) such as Ilaj-bil-Ghiza (dietotharapy), Ilaj bit tadabeer (regimenal therapy), Ilaj-bil-Dawa (pharmacotherapy or medicinal therapy).",

Recently, social maladjustment and Hikikomori states have also been noted to be highly prevalent among individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), which involve abnormalities in social interactions and communication. The individuals with PDDs report a tendency to sleep and wake at irregular or inappropriate times and to suffer from sleep disorders by nature, and they tend to sleep at extreme late night or during the day while experiencing social maladjustment and Hikikomori states. Therefore, it is probable that their oral hygiene might deteriorate due to a circadian rhythm disorder, such as an abnormal salivary secretion rhythm or refusals and noncooperation of dental care due to mood/emotional and social problems, underlying and caused by their sleep and wake patterns. In this review, we describe the importance of regular lifestyle, especially regular sleep–wake rhythm with appropriately timed bright light exposure during daytime, for management of oral health in PDDs via improving their circadian rhythm disorders.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "title": "Evidence base (EB) aproach to the first unprovoked epileptic seizure",
      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThis review is principally devoted to major sleep pathologies which pose exemplary problems for cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, physiology, internal, and pulmonary medicine. Fundamental information about the psychobiology and biorhythmic aspects of normal nocturnal slumber is presented and related to polygraphic findings on sleep pathology. Clinically significant increases in blood pressure, respiratory rate, cardiac irregularities and gastric acid secretion all occur in phase with the nocturnal sleep cycle. Exacerbations of duodenal ulcer and coronary-artery disease including cardiac arrhythmias at night have all been shown to coincide with REM sleep. Stereotyped abnormal leg movements associated with nocturnal myoclonus are due to activity of anterior tibialis or quadriceps muscles and occur episodically during the entire sleep period especially in the NREM-stages. Sleepiness has frequently been observed to accompany hypothyroidism and stages 3-4 are drastically reduced. The major symptoms of narcaolepsy are excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Drugs which suppress REM sleep such as monamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are effective in treating cataplexy. Central nervous system stimulants, particularly methylphenidate, are are recommended as the optimal treatment for controlling narcoleptic sleep attacks. The major treatment of upper airway sleep apnea is currently surgical. Successful therapy has been achieved in the central sleep apnea syndrome with imipramine and chlorimipramine. Although both respiratory problems disturb sleep about equally, central apnea leads to insomnia, while upper airway apnea is accompanied by hypersomnia. When tracheostomy is indicated it reduces the central apnea and obstructive apneic episodes during sleep. Polygraphic recording of human sleep has yielded extensive information about the nocturnal perturbations associated with clinical conditions characterized by physiological disregulation. The continued application of polysomnography possesses considerable promise for progress in diagnosis and treatment of those pathological states which lead to sleep continuity disturbances or are exacerbated by sleep itself. Attention to naturally occurring circadian and ultradian variations in the sleep-wakefulness rhythm would appear mandatory for comprehensive assessment and effective alleviation of impaired functioning related to temporal disruptions.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder which occurs in a large number of people, it can have a lot of different causes. Short lasting (acute) insomnias are mostly results of stressful situations which a person experiences in his or hers life, and they usually end when the source of the stress is removed. Chronic insomias have different causes and they are frequently associated with psyhological problems. Treatment of insomnia, depending on the severity, cause and the individual patient, can be simple or very complicated. Acute insomnia usually doesn't require special therapy, or if therapy is needed it is not long lasting and usually it doesn't show severe complications with it's use. Chronic insomnia can have different causes and it's therapy is usually long lasting. Pharmacotherapeutic possibilities of insomia treatment are usually based on administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (benzodiazepines and Z-drugs), but there are other options, such as antidepressants, ramelteon, melatonin, valerian, H1-antihistaminics and L-tryptophan. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality. Problems with the use of bendodiazepine receptor agonists are shown in daytime simptoms (fatigue, hangovers, restlessness) and the possibility of tolerance and dependence after longer use. Non pharmacological treatment are thought of as different methods of psyhological bihevioral therapy. The advantage here is that they show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality, and they are safe as a long term therapy option. The problem with this type of therapy is that it is expensive, it requiers specially trained experts and it doesn't show immediate results. Combined therapy has all the advantages of psyhological bihevioral therapy, with avoiding side effects which occure with pharmacological treatments. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, acupressure, yoga and tay-chi are other methods of insomnia treatment, but there are not a lot of studies in this field, and the ones that have been made have inconsistent results. When choosing a therapy option, one should always have in mind that it can be long lasting, and therefore the individuality of each patient should get the most attention, so the best possible, but affordable option can be determined.",

Many drugs have been studied in the management of this condition. Evidences suggest that lorazepam is better than diazepam or phenytoin for immediate control of status epilepticus. In the treatment of serially occurring seizures, diazepam gel administered rectally is effective in controlling seizures. For established status epilepticus, midazolam, lorazepam, phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam are effective agents in controlling seizures, but evidence base lacks the required degree of precision.

Several types of breathing dysfunction during sleep were identified independent of the patients' primary complaints. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was the most common; central sleep apnea and disturbances of the respiratory oscillator also were seen. Esophageal reflux was found to be the cause of some sleep-related problems. The observed respiratory irregularities were not associated with the usual cardiac response; a \"decoupling\" of heart rate from the respiratory cycle was noted during sleep in these patients.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health. Some fascinating clinical and experimental phenomena may represent bifurcations in the sleep/wake control system.",

OSA is characterized by ≥10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) ≥5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist’s role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",

The relationships between sleep and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are complex and are routinely overlooked by practitioners. Motricity and somnolence, the most consistent complaints and objectively measured sleep problems in children with ADHD, may develop as a consequence of multidirectional and multifactorial pathways. Therefore, subjectively perceived or reported restless sleep should be evaluated with specific attention to restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder, and awakenings should be queried with regard to parasomnias, dyssomnias and sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep hygiene logs detailing sleep onset and offset quantitatively, as well as qualitatively, are required. More studies in children with ADHD are needed to reveal the 24-h phenotype, or its sleep comorbidities.",
