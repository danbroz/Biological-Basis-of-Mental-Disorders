As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "abstract": "Depression can occur in association with virtually all the other psychiatric and physical diagnoses. Physical illness increases the risk of developing severe depressive illness. There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues.

The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

It is usually recognized by the sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and loss of general interest that accompanies it, but undoubtedly many people are given needless operations and many patients refuse to get well because the symptoms rather than the underlying depression are treated.

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Physical illness is a frequent event in everyone's life and in most cases has no particular effect on the psychological structure of the individual. However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

The physician should rule out three psychiatric disorders in which unexplained physical symptoms often dominate the clinical picture. These are hysteria, anxiety neurosis, and depression. Each is a definite syndrome with specific diagnostic criteria and a well-documented natural history. Hysteria and anxiety neurosis often can be managed as successfully by an internist or general practitioner as by a psychiatrist. Depression more often justifies a psychiatric referral. \"Functional\" symptoms which cannot be attributed to one of these syndromes often warrant further search for an organic cause.",

Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

Accurate treatment mandates a detailed history, often with collaboration with the family, and a thorough medical evaluation for other comorbid illnesses that may contribute to the patient's current presentation. The treatment of depressive symptoms in the elderly requires an understanding of both the origin of these symptoms and the proper treatment of the underlying disorder whether it is due to medical, dementing, psycho-social or melancholic factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

However, other problems reflect philosophical positions ranging from those based on the premise that primary depression does not fit the medical model and therefore is not a \"disease\" that can be modeled, to those holding that the emotional state of depression is so uniquely human that subhuman organisms cannot be used in its analysis. In evaluating animal models of any human disorder or condition, it is crucial for those using the models to keep abreast of developments and advances in the relevant clinical knowledge concerning the particular condition being studied. This is especially important for such disorders as essential hypertension or major depression where the central causative factors are not yet known, but where extensive clinical investigation is constantly expanding knowledge of the patients' condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal sensory experiences, or hallucinations (e.g., hearing voices that are not there); odd beliefs not shared by those around you, or delusions (e.g., that one is being followed by the FBI or that one's thoughts can be heard by nearby people); loss of normal functions such as motivation and anticipating pleasure (i.e., negative symptoms); cognitive impairment; and problems in social functioning. It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

The symptoms may be primarily psychological, such as misery, indecisiveness, irritability, inability to concentrate, or insomnia. They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one. In spite of thorough investigation, there will remain a proportion of patients in whom no lesion can be found to account for their symptoms.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

The sequelae of critical illness often extend beyond patients and impact the families of critically ill patients.",

To meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5), the full symptom picture must be present for more than one month, and the disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning [1].",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw.

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

A diagnosis of depressive disorder depends on the underlying cause, and on the nature, severity and duration of symptoms. Management involves accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical illness, practical interventions to resolve concurrent family, social and economic stressors, and emotional support. Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms.

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Anticipation of these situations is also experienced with uneasiness, distress or fear.

But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position.

Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "title": "Depresija kao javnozdravstveni problem",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next.

Stress is usually viewed as a mediator, that is, an unobservable inferred construct which is hypothesized to account for a certain observable behaviour such as health or illness differences between individuals. The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

The actual prevalence varies according to the setting, type and severity of disease, the individual's perception of their condition and premorbid risk factors (e.g. childhood adversity). Depression has a bi-directional causal relationship with physical disease, so each can be a risk factor for the other. Depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur more often than as separate conditions and are often undetected or diagnosed by primary and secondary healthcare staff. People who experience depression and physical illness understand depression as part of their whole life experience and not just as being simply related to their physical health. Depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, in the context of physical disease are associated with a range of poor outcomes, including poorer physical health outcomes and quality of life; increased hospitalisations, investigations and healthcare costs; and higher mortality.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist.

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "title": "Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Mada is considered as a prodromal phase of Unamada , or it can occur as an independent disease condition also. Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

Depression of middle age is subdivided depending on the predomination of one or another disorder in the clinical picture. There are simple depression and complicated depression with additional psychopathological symptoms. The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness.

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

Worldwide, depression is a major cause of disability and premature death. Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology.

A crucial question is whether stress is an epiphenomenon or a decisive factor in the causation of (certain forms of) mood disorder. Certainty about this question can only be obtained when it can be demonstrated that stress phenomena may induce changes in brain functioning similar to the ones supposedly associated with (certain forms of) depression. Since the phenomenology of stress syndromes, as well as their emotional intensity, are highly variable, careful diagnosis is a first requirement. In studies into the significance of stress in the occurrence of depression this degree of finesse has not been achieved. The major shortcomings are discussed. Those should be systematically addressed to provide this type of research with the necessary acuity.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

Within gastroenterology, attention has focused on the increased frequency of abuse history, particularly for patients with refractory functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Furthermore, regardless of diagnosis, abuse history can impair health status and one's ability to cope with one's medical condition. Especially for patients with painful functional GI disorders resistant to usual treatments, the physician should inquire in a supportive manner about the possibility of a prior abuse history or other psychosocial traumas (e.g., major loss).

It is not known to what extent these medical conditions precede or lead to depression. The present study proposes to identify somatic comorbities in a group of patients with major depressive disorder. The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk. Early and effective treatment leads to a lower mortality rate.",

Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus.

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "title": "Stress exposure, perceived stress severity, and their effects on health",
      "abstract": "While stress is one of the central concepts in many contemporary theories of health, there is no universal definition of stress or stressors. Stress is usually understood as a subjective experience of tension, pressure, distress, fear or negative emotions that occurs as a result of a perceived threat to one’s mental or physical well-being and is accompanied by an evolved biological response that facilitates adaptive reaction. While stress is conceptualized as a taxing condition, it is not understood as uniformly harmful per se. In fact, stress response is often cited as an adaptive reaction. Moreover, not every incident of stress exposure results in a disease or has an undermining effect on health. Mere exposure to stress does not warrant the healthy organism’s falling ill. Yet stress has been shown to affect health both directly and indirectly, having impact on multiple chronic conditions. Stressors vary in their severity and their ability to leave their mark on health, and it is therefore important to develop reliable methods of measuring stress to better understand how stress affects health and instigates pathology. One of the difficulties of measuring the effects of stress is connected to the distinction between external stressors and their internal appraisal. More recently, stress researchers began to make a distinction between stress exposure (i.e., facing an objectively measurable stressor) and perceived stress severity (i.e., a subjective experience of stress resulting from individual’s facing a stressor). The latter has been shown to have a superior predictive ability in terms of negative health outcomes (both breadth and depth of observed effects) compared to the former. Measurement-wise, subjective stress also tends to yield more precise results, which makes it preferable as a stress-assessment tool. The present article is a literature review study that delves into this distinction and attempts to shed light onto its implications for measuring stress and its effects on health.",

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "title": "Psychodiagnostics as a mandatory element of patient protocols in dentistry",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The psycho-emotional status of patients requiring dental treatment is severely affected by constant stress.[1] Stress is associated with visible or perceived defects that disrupt the patient's image: difficulties in articulating words during chewing or communicating with other people. The severity of such a stressful condition depends on several factors. Among these are the type of nervous activity, characteristics of the patient's perception of their image, social environment and social reaction to the patient's appearance, patient's assessment of their own condition, and the dentist's attitude toward the patient's psycho-emotional state.[2] Many unsuccessful dental interventions occur primarily due to the negative emotional mood of patients; however, they also deal with the discomfort that they experience both during and after the dental procedure. That is exacerbated by increasing stress, anxiety, and psycho-emotional tension or exhaustion, diminishing the positive effect of dental treatment.[3] Further, numerous research works observed possible changes in the normal functioning of the patient's body, namely, in pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate values.[456] These are visible in the results of studies when the ECG was performed during dental surgery.[7] Such deviations might also have the opposite effect. Thus, psycho-emotional stress leads to a delay in the grafting process. Changes in the nervous and endocrine systems can cause certain disturbances in the hemostatic system.[8] High emotional tension is also known to cause a specific contraction of the skeletal musculature of the face, which results in a manifestation of a local vascular response.[9] Another psycho-emotional trait that characterizes patients with dental problems is the anticipation of pain far before the start of the surgery. Some particularly sensitive patients can experience serious emotional trauma, even during simple dental procedures such as dental extraction. Fear can occur at the anesthesia stage, and the patient's body is then characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, which exceeds energy production. Psycho-emotional stress results in a 17% increase in oxygen consumption on average, triggering anaerobic glycolysis. This process, in turn, is a precursor to acidosis, leading to tissue hypoxia and a delayed reparation process. Increased anxiety is the cause of maladaptation and the appearance of neuropsychic disorders, as well as a slower recovery rate after surgery.[10] Psychodiagnosis is, thus, a necessary element of dental treatment. The use of dental questionnaires contributes to the selection of appropriate tactics for interaction between the physician and the patient. In this case, the questionnaires both before and after patients' dental treatment appear necessary. Comparing the results of the pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire provides good insights into the effectiveness of dental treatment. As there are relatively few studies of this type to date, it appears necessary and relevant to conduct them. In order to adequately assess patient satisfaction with the quality of dental care provided, specialized questionnaires may be helpful, in addition to traditional methods of psycho-emotional analysis.[11] They contain dental questions that are relevant to both the dentist and the patient.[12] Once these questionnaires have been analyzed, the right tactics for patient rehabilitation can be selected.[13] A logical construction of such an analysis is the study of changes in the values of indicators of the patient's psychological state both before and after dental intervention.[14] Such an analysis is a reliable measure of the effectiveness and quality of dental care provided.[1516] Further, these studies appear necessary as they may contribute to the improvement of dental service quality. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis of the psycho-emotional condition of patients both before and after dental surgery. The objectives of the study were: (a) to examine the psycho-emotional state of patients with removable constructions; (b) similarly, to examine the state of patients with fixed constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS The study was conducted in the Russian Federation in 2019–2020; it addressed data on patients from three dental clinics (two clinics from the Moscow city [Dental Clinic No. 62 of the Moscow City Health Department and Dental Clinic No. 12 of the Moscow City Health Department] and one clinic from the Perm city [City Dental Clinic No. 1]). The study involved a total of 600 patients divided into three groups. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 63 years, with a mean age of 42.0 ± 5.5 years. The average age and the number of men and women in each group are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Gender composition and average age of patients in the three groupsThe number of men and women in each group was similar (P ≥ 0.05; Table 1). The age of patients within each group and between groups also had no significant differences. The first group consisted of 200 patients with fixed dentures (metal-ceramic, used up to 3 years); the second group included patients with removable devices (200 patients); and the control group comprised 200 patients with healthy teeth. The dental procedures were provided under local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN The Fere method was applied to estimate the predominant activity of the hemispheres. A scheme included three components: a current source and its amplifier (15 mAm) + silver electrodes (S = 2 cm2) + ohmmeter. Parameters of this skin-galvanic reaction were taken from two fingers of the right and left hands. Parameters on different hands were measured separately, first on the left hand and then on the right hand. Low resistance values at the moment of data acquisition allowed concluding the right hemisphere dominance in the patient's mental and emotional spheres and the corresponding emotional manifestations, namely, aggression, negative emotions, and increased anxiety. On the left side, the same data indicated the dominance of the left hemisphere with the corresponding emotions—satisfaction and positive emotions. Afterward, a bilateral asymmetry of hemispheric activity was calculated, when the left-hand indicators were divided by the right-hand indicators. The index value equaling to one was considered to be a physiological norm. Thus, the activity of the hemispheres was balanced. This study was conducted following international ethical and moral standards (the Helsinki Declaration of 1975). When working with patients, their written consent to data processing was obtained. Anonymity and confidentiality of information were preserved. RESEARCH METHODS Levels of anxiety and pain were determined by using a questionnaire. For this purpose, a generally accepted scale of patients' self-assessment of anxiety by Spielberger and Hanin and a Universal Pain Assessment Tool were applied. This test adequately reflects personal and reactive anxiety, estimating it as a constant characteristic of a personality. The advantage of the test is its validity and informativeness in the self-assessment of anxiety levels. The test includes two blocks corresponding to the level of reactive (questions 1 to 20) and personal (questions 21 to 40) anxiety. Reactive anxiety was calculated following the formula P = (A1 − A2) + 50, where A1 is the sum of 3–4, 6–7, 9, 12–14, and 18 items of the anxiety level scale, and A2 is the sum of items 1–2, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 19–20. Similarly, the level of personal anxiety was calculated using the formula L = (A1 − A2) + 35, in which A1 corresponds to the sum of items from questions 22 to 25 inclusive, questions 28 and 29, 31 and 32, also questions 34 and 35, questions 37 to 39 inclusive, and A2 is the sum of items from the remaining questions. Pain level was interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10 or by monitoring the patient's behavior. Each patient also filled out a questionnaire designed to express their opinion about the quality of dental treatment received. The questionnaire included questions on the patient's assessment of their teeth condition and their opinion on how the treatment affected their health and various aspects of life. The list of questions also included social aspects of the patient's life and, from the patient's point of view, the necessity and obligation of visiting the dentist. RESEARCH ALGORITHM The study was performed in the following way. First, a testing of Fere's skin-galvanic reaction was performed. Then, each of the patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire developed by the authors. Pain assessment was performed during the dental procedure under local anesthesia. Afterward, the skin-galvanic reaction readings were taken again, and the Spielberger-Hanin Scale questionnaire was administered. The Anxiety Scale questionnaire was offered once since in case of repeated completion, the patient may deliberately change the answers following his/her momentum opinion that the wrong answer was chosen at the beginning. The aim was to capture the possible relationship between questions about dental health and changes in anxiety levels. The algorithm allows establishing a clear psychodiagnostic of the patient's psychic state after the dental procedure, in particular, to reveal any changes in anxiety scores after the received therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data were processed using Statistica v. 6.0. A two-sample t-test for independent samples was used to detect the significance of differences. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The distribution of features corresponded to normal, allowing for the establishment of Pearson's correlations. Tables 1–3 show arithmetic mean values for each parameter and the error of the mean.Table 2: Psychodiagnostics results of patients with healthy teeth (control group) before and after the survey about the condition of teethTable 3: Characteristics of psycho-emotional condition in patients from Group 1 (fixed metal-ceramic dentures) before and after evaluation of dental statusRESULTS For the control group, the asymmetry hemispheric activity index in 81 patients was within unity, which corresponded to a state of equilibrium. For another 69 patients, this index was less than unity, which corresponded to positive mood and the dominance of the left hemisphere. Finally, in 60 patients, the coefficient exceeded unity, which corresponded to dominance of the right hemisphere and negative emotional mood [Table 2]. In the control group, significant differences were established only for female patients. In both groups, with equilibrium and negative hemispheric activity index, the differences between the values before and after treatment were significant toward a 1.1-fold increase [Table 2]. The other indicators, particularly in the male group, did not differ from those in the control one. A direct correlation was established between the score in the dental status questionnaire and the emotions with which the patient filled out the questionnaire. This correlation was more pronounced in women (0.72; P ≤ 0.05) compared with men, namely, 0.72 vs. 0.57 at P ≤ 0.05, respectively. Consequently, the emotional state of the patients can influence the answers in the dental status questionnaire. There was also a direct correlation between the score growth in the questionnaire and the values of the hemispheric activity index after the survey, namely, 0.75 (P ≤ 0.05) for women and 0.64 (P ≤ 0.05) for men. Thus, the questions of the survey itself can have a significant influence on the patients' emotional state. At the same time, no statistically significant correlation between anxiety scores and the results of the dental status questionnaire were recorded for the control group. For patients from the second group with removable dentures, the hemispheric activity index corresponded to unity in 83 patients, that is, was equilibrium; in 48 patients, it was less than unity, that is, the left hemisphere and positive emotions dominated; and in the remaining 69 patients, the index exceeded unity, that is, the right hemisphere and negative emotions dominated. However, after a survey about dental health, the following changes were observed: 55 patients reported a state of equilibrium, 37 patients had positive emotional disposition, and the remaining 108 had a negative empathy. Significant changes were also obtained for the hemispheric activity index after the dental status survey, namely a 1.3-fold in men with the positive emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), a 2.2-fold in women with the negative emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), and a 2.1-fold in men from the same group (P ≤ 0.01). Also, a direct correlation between the increase of patients' questionnaire scores and their emotional state was recorded: 0.70 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.79 for men (P ≤ 0.05). These results indicate the influence of the patient's emotional state on the questionnaire results. After the survey, however, this relationship intensified in Group 2, and the correlation between the scores and hemispheric activity factor was 0.88 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.91 for men (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the control group, there was also a correlation between the anxiety level and score growth rates. Thus, for personal anxiety in men, the Pearson's correlation was 0.84 for both genders (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the reactive anxiety index amounted to 0.78 for women and 0.81 for men (P ≤ 0.05). The increasing level of anxiety indicates a negative influence of responses about dental treatment, which is also illustrated by the increasing number of patients with a negative emotional empathy in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 had a similar emotional state distribution compared with Group 2 before completing the dental status questionnaire. Thus, 87 had an equilibrium status with index values around unity, 68 were positive, and 43 were negative [Table 3]. After the patients answered the questions about dental health, the ratio of subgroups with different emotional moods changed in favor of the negative one. Hence, there were 80 people in an equilibrium state, 63 were positively inclined, and 57 had a negative emotional disposition [Table 3]. This indicates a tendency for the negative emotional mood to increase after the survey on dental status. Significant changes in the hemispheric activity coefficient both before and after treatment were noted for men with positive mood (a 1.1-fold increase, P ≤ 0.01), for women with negative mood (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05), and for men from the same group (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05). There was a direct correlation between the increased scores and emotional disposition among men and women in Group 1, namely 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Also, a correlation was established between the value of the hemispheric activity factor and the increased scores after the survey was recorded, namely, 0.82 for men and 0.81 for women (P ≤ 0.05). A correlation between an increase in the scores and the values of personal anxiety for men and women was 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). For reactive anxiety, these indices were 0.56 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). As a result, patients in Groups 1 and 2 with removable and fixed dentures differ in anxiety levels. This confirms the hypothesis that the results of the dental health survey generally have a negative impact on the psycho-emotional status of the patient, especially when the local type of anesthesia is used. DISCUSSION This study showed that after the survey on dental status and quality of life was conducted, a significant increase in the hemispheric activity index values was noted among patients in the groups with removable and fixed dentures demonstrated. Hence, the emotional state of the patients changed toward the negative in both groups in general. These changes affected most patients with negative emotional mood prior to the administration of the questionnaire. There was also a dependence on the type of dentures. In Group 2 (with removable dentures), the increase in negative emotions was more pronounced, with the indices of anxiety varying more in male patients. Thus, the survey results can be used to perform a psychodiagnostic of the patient's emotional condition. If the patient scored up to 18 points on the survey, it can be stated that he or she is satisfied with the dental treatment provided. When the number of points ranges from 18.0 to 29.0, the patient can be considered as only partially satisfied with the quality of dental care provided. If a patient scores more than 29 points based on the test results, it can be assumed that they are not satisfied with the dental treatment performed. The behavioral response of patients under local anesthesia in the first group suggested a moderate level of pain. According to the results on the hemispheric activity index, the indicators of negative emotional mood worsened 1.2 times (P ≤ 0.05) for men and women in the group with fixed dentures; however, in the group with removable dentures, this tendency was stronger with 2.2 and 2.1 times, accordingly (P ≤ 0.01). These results are supported by the increased level of anxiety in patients with removable and fixed dentures. No emotional changes were found in any of the controls. The significance of differences between the groups according to the survey results was confirmed by statistical tests and established correlations between the emotional mood and the increase in scores. Among the study limitations, the factor of gender belonging (significant differences obtained for men and women) and the state of the patient's psyche should be particularly considered. In cases where the patient's mental condition may deviate from generally accepted norms (i.e., phobias), the test results may not adequately correspond to the patient's real psycho-emotional state. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the stress level of patients with epilepsy during dental procedures.[17] Data from questionnaires administered to 85 patients with epilepsy before elective dental surgery were considered. Dental anxiety was found in 17.6% of patients (n = 15). At the same time, dental anxiety did not correspond to factors such as age, level of education, type of epilepsy, frequency of attacks, use of antiepileptics, and many others. However, a significant correlation was found between gender (P < 0.01) and the type of oral surgery (removal of a retained third molar; P < 0.05) on the one hand and the level of dental anxiety on the other. Similar results were reported in other studies.[1819] A relationship to the gender factor was also established in this study. Results from this study are generally consistent with similar research. Thus, using data on 105 patients (aged 18–23 years) of dental clinics, it was found that different groups demonstrated various anxiety levels expressed in dentophobia and salivary pH changes.[20] Group 1 demonstrated a low level of anxiety and consisted of 33 patients (31.4%). Group 2 included 32 patients (30.5%) with moderate anxiety levels; however, in Group 2 with 40 patients (38.1%), a high anxiety level was recorded.[20] Of the 105 study participants, 85% showed low levels of dentophobia, 27% demonstrated low levels of anxiety, 29% showed moderate anxiety levels, and 28% showed high levels of anxiety. The mean salivary pH of all participants was 6.79 at rest and 6.43 in anxiety.[20] Thus, saliva pH may also be a factor worth considering in such studies. Another study showed that microcirculatory changes can indicate psycho-emotional stress development.[21] The study included 30 patients. The control group consisted of patients without psycho-emotional disorders but with postprosthetic complications after dental implantation. The results obtained showed that the capillary blood flow during stress changes at both oscillatory and nonoscillatory levels. At vasodilatation, an intensification of blood flow and disruption of venous flow was established. Analysis of high- and low-frequency oscillations by wavelet transformations revealed an increase in endothelium activity and a decrease in sympathetic adrenergic vasomotor and precapillary tone. Psycho-emotional stress is, therefore, mostly caused by a physiological factor. The patient's consciousness in dental clinic is a comprehensive relationship with the stimuli received from external and internal receptors. Through the interaction of these receptors, the consciousness forms a kind of emotional background, reflecting the patient's perception of the physical condition.[22232425] Besides, all of the patient's perceptions or experiences about their condition are reflected in the way they relate to their health.[26] In general, such patients can be divided into three groups: with a dismissive attitude, with an adequate attitude, and finally, the group with increased attention to their health.[16] Other data indicate that a negative emotional background is influenced by factors, such as the patient's intelligence, the intensity of pain, and the severity of the ongoing disease or upcoming dental procedure.[2728] Thus, research into the patient's emotional activity type plays an important role in subsequent dental treatment. The predominance of negative emotions, such as irritability, demandingness, and the frustration of their physical sensations, constitute a significant proportion among character traits, which also affect the patient's social life.[29] It is known that among the patients who have agreed to treatment, feelings of fear and pain may increase even before the dental treatment starts. Fear may take different, and often opposing, forms, such as worry, euphoria, and anxiety. Of the techniques used, two approaches are dominant.[22] The first approach is clinical, consisting of analytical conversations with the patient and observing behavioral patterns. The second approach is a laboratory one, which is less costly in time and resources and implies the use of questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaires are the Eysenck questionnaire, the MMPI, and the MMPI 2. Further, the Eysenck questionnaire links types of temperament, extraversion and introversion, as well as stability and instability. However, most of the questionnaires show different deficiencies. Some of them diagnose a small number of psychoypes, others are too cumbersome, and many do not include psychometric properties. CONCLUSION This study showed that changes in the hemispheric activity index and indicators of personal and reactive anxiety are related to the survey results on the dental status and the type of dental service provided. By the quality-of-life criteria, the values obtained were different according to the emotional mood of the patient. It follows that obtaining reliable information about the patient's satisfaction with the dental care provided, questionnaires on the patient's dental health status are required in addition to the standard psychodiagnostic techniques. The study and analysis of the data obtained allow for the right choice to restore the patient's physical and mental health after receiving dental care. Such a multicomponent approach can greatly enhance the quality of dental treatments and establish the most efficient methods. These results are confirmed by the heightened level of anxiety in patients in groups with removable and fixed prostheses. No change of emotional mood was noted in controls.

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.).

Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression.

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma.

Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

      "title": "Depresija kao rizični čimbenik za školski uspjeh kod adolescenata",
      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "A variety of reactions are observed after a major trauma. In the majority of cases these resolve without any long-term consequences. In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Although multiple definitions have been used to describe the symptom, the most common explanation is that of chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort (a subjective negative feeling that may be associated with early satiety, fullness, bloating, or nausea) centered in the upper abdomen. When a thorough evaluation of a dyspeptic patient fails to identify a cause for her symptoms, the label of nonulcer or functional dyspepsia is applied.

The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "The word “depression” has come to be used in psychiatry to denote both a syndrome (or symptom:sign cluster) and one or more of the symptoms commonly occurring in this cluster. This attribution of two meanings to one term has led to considerable confusion. Thus it is often claimed that depression may be present in almost any mental illness. This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters. To deny this would be to deny the original principles of division.",

A weaker immune system, high blood pressure, heart problems, depression, and other harmful health conditions have all been linked to prolonged stress. Any external or internal discomfort that is caused by a physical, chemical, or emotional stressor may contribute to the complaint. Stress can also be defined as a state of being. Trauma, illnesses, poisons, injuries of any type, and infections of all kinds are examples of physical and chemical variables that can cause stress. There are many different types of emotional reasons of stress and strain.

      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

Stress is a combination of physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioural and emotional responses to new or threatening stimuli and serves as a protective adaptation of the body under physiological conditions. In accordance with the effect on the body, beneficial and negative stress is distinguished. Stress can be divided into “chronic” and “acute”. The intensity of the physiological response to a stressor is highly individual and situationally dependent. Many variables, including personal attributes, coping strategies, social support, and past experiences may modify the physiological stress response in any given situation and can account for the different response of people exposed to the same stressor. Intense and persistent stress can lead to psychological and pathological body injury. Stress has a significant impact on different brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala etc. Depression, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and even stress-induced mental diseases are closely related to functional and structural damage of the related brain regions. Repetitive daily acute stress can be associated with different diseases, first of all cardiovascular diseases, which affect quality of life and can cut short life expectancy. Timely treatment is required to prevent progression of early stress reactions to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in individuals at high risk. Advanced stress and anxiety management interventions include non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.",

      "title": "Disorders of Emotion",
      "abstract": "It is customary to distinguish between feelings and emotions. A feeling can be defined as a positive or negative reaction to some experience or event and is the subjective or experiential aspect of emotion. By contrast, emotion is a stirred-up state caused by physiological changes occurring as a response to some event and which tends to maintain or abolish the causative event. The feelings may be those of depression, anxiety, fear and so on. Mood is a pervasive and sustained emotion that colours the person's perception of the world. Descriptions of mood should include intensity, duration and fluctuations as well as adjectival descriptions of the type. Affect, meaning short-lived emotion, is defined as the patient's present emotional responsiveness. It is what the doctor infers from the patient's body language, including facial expression, and it may or may not be congruent with mood. It is described as being within normal range, constricted, blunt or flat.",

      "title": "Functional limitations associated with mental disorders : inescapable fact or avoidable reality?",
      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

Introduction</h3> A central notion in psychosomatic theory is that emotion which is dammed-up and fails to be \"discharged\" leads to physiological alterations which eventuate in tissue pathology. Concerning the physiological changes accompanying emotional responses, Dunbar<sup>3</sup>states: \"If they are not discharged in action they tend to persist or to be followed by other changes, such for example as disturbed endocrine balance . . . and any state of chronic disturbance of function tends to become crystallized in structural change.\" Similarily, Alexander<sup>1</sup>indicates that: \"Fear, aggression, guilt, frustrated wishes, if repressed, result in permanent chronic emotional tension which disturb the functions of the vegetative organs.\" Manifold clinical reports have suggested that a concomitance exists between the presence or exacerbation of \"psychosomatic\" disorders and emotion which is repressed or suppressed. Research has demonstrated clearly that widespread physiological changes take place during the development of overt emotional states. But",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

The clinical differentiation between functional and organic disease is at times difficult to establish, because, presumptively, in the beginning, at least, all organic disease is preceded by a physiologic perversion, that is, functional alteration, which may or may not be apparent with our present diagnostic limitations. Likewise, many conditions cause disturbance of rate or rhythm, the exact mode of production not always known, which, though hardly distinguishable from the symptoms of emotional or vasomotor instability, should as a rule not be classified as functional states in a restricted",

Since it is usually accompanied by nervousness, anxiety and other negative emotions, return to health can be longer than necessary. Hence much attention is paid to medical interventions which allow pain relief or a total elimination thereof. In some circumstances, however, they may be inadequate, that is why other, extra-medical factors are being explored.

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode.

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

These events range from extreme high magnitude stressors such as torture, terror attacks, rape, childhood sexual abuse, natural disasters, or war to more commonly experienced stressors such as the loss of a romantic relationship, persistent physical illness, or business difficulties. Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder share the same traumatic stressor criteria involving \"exposure to a threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation\" and include direct experiencing, witnessing, or learning about a stressor.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own.

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDRD) involves lack of integration of one or more components of perception and characterizes by \"the presence of recurrent or persistent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both\".

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "title": "CS03-04 - Concept of somatoform disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

      "abstract": "The medical causes of coma fall into two main categories: intercranial diseases, and metabolic disturbances. The clinical examination should define 1) vital functions, 2) depth of coma, 3) whether cerebral signs are diffuse or local, 4) any signs of organ disease. The blood sugar level must be determined. Hypoglycemia may be the cause even if the signs point to another cause. Head injury and intoxication/poisoning must always be considered, even if a medical cause is suspected. Prolonged coma calls for repeated clinical and laboratory examination. Combinations of causes, e.g. organ disease plus intoxication should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u.

There are three factors namely; mental breakdown, mental disturbances, and mental illness impair the mental health of employees. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life. Workplace stress derives specifically from conditions in their workplace. This condition may either cause stress initially or aggravate the stress already present from other sources. Studies have pointed to the growth in non-standard work and other changing work patterns as contributing to a recent sharp increase in stress leads in the workplace. In organizations the ergonomic the concern is work stress, which in any action from an external source that affects the body. This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents. Besides, employee’s health also provides other benefits such as improved morale of employees, increased productivity of employees and also longer working period of an employee which, of course cannot be easily measured.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

Conceiving of depression as a stand-alone diagnostic entity repeats the mistake of assuming a division between the mind and the body. Depression and anxiety frequently coexist, and generalized anxiety disorder may precede a major depression. Most mood disorders are dealt with at the level of primary care. The current understanding and clinical approach to them is dominated by a model derived from psychiatry, where there are significant differences in patient population and priorities from those in family practice. Family medicine has come under criticism for uncritically accepting this model and for failing to develop a model suitable for the family practice setting.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Most patients experience recurrent attacks, which converts depression into a chronic disease. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a type of emotional dysfunction caused by genetic abnormalities or great changes in the patient’s environment, which can manifest as a host of symptoms such as persistent and spontaneous depression with changes in cognitive function. According to worldwide statistics, 50% of suicides each year occur during episodes of depression, and patients with MDD are 20 times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.",

      "title": "[The practice of intensive care medicine as a stress situation].",
      "abstract": "A study about the problem of stress in physician who work in intensive care units requires a previous reflection about the stress concept itself. Selye's conception undoubtedly signified a great progress for the comprehension of the processes of biological adaptation, but it seems it can not be easily applied to the psychological and social field. The decrease of psychosomatic diseases during the last world war is one of the many examples that make question the causal relationship between stress and disease. The concept of life event in anglo-saxon psychiatry is also discussed, as well as its attempt to measure the stressor character of these circumstances through a scale of points. The concept of \"pathogenic situation\" of German psychiatry is proposed in exchange. From this perspective, medicine in general and intensive medicine in particular can be seen as human activities constituting \"pathogenic situations\" for the ones who exercise them. The corresponding literature allows to establish that medicine generates more pathology in physicians than other professions, but intensive medicine does not seem to be more pathogenic than other specialties. The elements of the \"medical act\" which could be responsible for the stress or pathogenic situation are studied. Respecting intensive medicine, two are the characteristics which seem to contribute to make it \"pathogenic\" for those who exercise it: a mistaken vision of death as an \"enemy\" which has to be fought à outrance, and the \"temporality of urgency\", proper to an ICU, which makes that the doctor can not give himself time enough for listening to the patient and telling him the adequate word of consolation.",

There is a lack of useful biomarkers common to all people who meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnostic construct that differentiates them from the healthy population. This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious. Many diagnostic constructs—medical or psychiatric—involve complex polygenetic interactions with the environment.",

While clinicians do not know if chronic pain induces depression or depression initiates pain, co-morbidity is common and the burden of illness increases when patients suffer from both illnesses. The patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases leading to decreased functioning which makes the treatment for pain more complicated. Patients who have chronic pain also may benefits from antidepressant medications for improved function and quality of life.

When stress becomes a prolonged or chronic experience, it can result in psychological distress, including generalized anxiety, burnout, and depressive symptoms. Anxiety, fatigue, burnout, and depression are familiar examples of \"distress\" and evidence has demonstrated that they are associated with prolonged exposure to stressful work. Many studies have shown an association between job strain and some form of psychological distress. Several other studies that have measured job strain and anxiety, often as part of a battery of \"psychological distress\" domains, have shown a positive correlation between high job strain and anxiety. Work-related stress can also be a factor in exacerbating pre-existing mental illnesses and may even precipitate clinically diagnosable symptoms of depression. The work environment is filled with challenges that provoke \"stress\" and engage our adaptive coping abilities.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

Thus, to take a common example from routine medical practice, upon finding that a patient has hypertension, the next step is to make an etiologic diagnosis by looking for the various causes of secondary hypertension, e.g., pheochromcytoma, before setting on a diagnosis of primary or idiopathic hypertension. A similar procedure should occur in the psychiatric evaluation of, say, a patient with depression, first looking for secondary causes, such as Cushing's syndrome, before considering a diagnosis of one of the idiopathic causes, shch as major depressive disorder. The goal of this chapter is to describe the secondary causes of several of the major psychiatric syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "title": "Major Depressive Disorder in Medical Illness: A Review of Assessment, Prevalence, and Treatment Options",
      "abstract": "Major depression, as well as other depressive disorders, is commonly comorbid with other medical illnesses, particularly chronic and systemic medical illnesses. The co-occurrence of the disorders is so common that it challenges our notions of the meaning of comorbidity and our desire to neatly separate psychiatric and medical illnesses. The overlap between symptoms of physical illness and the neurovegetative symptoms of major depression and the initial normative emotional response to physical illness add to the challenge of accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of depression in the medically ill. We review the literature on the comorbidity of depression and the various medical illnesses, including diagnostic and treatment approaches. The differential diagnosis for major depression among medically ill patients should include delirium and medication-induced symptoms. We suggest that major depression itself may be best conceptualized as a systemic illness whose pathophysiology overlaps with other systemic medical illnesses. The initial treatment strategies for major depression in medical illness are like those for the general population; however, the comorbid medical illnesses may interfere with remission. To illustrate these points, we describe a patient with clinical characteristics covered in this review who experienced major depression as well as several chronic illnesses, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain due to degenerative joint disease, and diabetes mellitus.",

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability. (7), (8) Anxiety symptoms may predict progressing physical disability among older women and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living over 1 year. …",

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

What is unclear is how much impact the pharmaceutical industry has in defining what mental illness is or, more particularly, what constitutes depression and what treatment should be prescribed. It is being postulated that the biological model is taking hold (partly due to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). This emphasizes the biological aspect of depression rather than placing an emphasis on environmental issues (i.e., problems in living), hence, reducing knowledge pools into two distinct dichotomies (biological and psychological). The increased emphasis on the biological model appears to be in direct correlation with how emotions are being medicalized, ultimately impacting the rate of psychotropic therapy, which positively impacts the fiscal success of the pharmaceutical industry.",

Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood.

      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble.

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

The close relationship between stress and migraine attacks and the significant psychiatric comorbidities in migraine provide evidence of a \"paradigm\" of tight interaction between somatic and psychological aspects in paediatric migraine. In particular in younger children, an uncomfortable situation, a psychological problem or an emotional distress is rarely expressed directly but usually through physical symptoms. So migraine may be considered as a disorder of psychobiological adaptation in which genetic predisposition interplays with internal and/or external environmental influences such as psycho-emotional, climatic, hormonal, dietary or other factors.",

As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses.

Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others.

The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure. Thus, a frequent early complaint is that the patient is",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

Although, the importance of emotional ventilation can never be understated in order to manage mental health, according to the WHO, depression is a mental disorder that is identified by a loss of pleasure or interest in daily activities for a long period of time, the causes of which may vary from physical or emotional abuse to severe losses in life. Depression needs to be diagnosed and treated, whereas the misuse of the term may lead to misidentification and the illusion that talking to loved ones and getting indulged in one’s favourite activities can cure it.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex disorder that is commonly associated with brain dysfunction, social isolation, and vocational difficulty. Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric illness in epilepsy, but emerging evidence is providing a more complete and clearer elucidation of the problem. Clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with quality of life than does the seizure rate. In fact, depression is second only to medication toxicity as the clinical factor that explains the greatest variance in quality of life. Only a small number of studies have investigated the plausible neurobiological mechanisms of depression in epilepsy, but preliminary data suggest that underlying brain dysfunction may be a more important predictor than vocational or social disability. Furthermore, specific aspects of hippocampal dysfunction may be a causal factor in the genesis and maintenance of depression in temporal lobe epilepsy. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management are expected to become available in the near future.",

As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs.

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress.

      "abstract": "The aim of this analysis was to highlight the significance of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive mood disorders in older adults, as well as to expand the knowledge of social educators and geragogists regarding the basic symptoms of depression. Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a term that refers to a clinical syndrome or disorder characterised by a feeling of hopelessness or unhappiness. Symptoms include weight loss with loss of pleasure, sleep changes (i.e. insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or regression, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, reduced ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. Basically, treatment consists of pharmacological and psychological interventions. Although these treatments are effective, not all patients achieve the same results. In this case, alternative approaches are needed to prevent and treat depression. Our literature review shows that high levels of physical activity and exercise have protective effects on depression cases. In combination with other treatment modalities, exercise and physical activity may lead to a more rapid improvement of the clinical picture. In this article, we reviewed the current literature on the use of physical activity and exercise for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

      "title": "Euthymic suffering and wisdom psychology",
      "abstract": "In Fava and Guidi's paper1, euthymia is defined by \"lack of mood disturbances that can be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics\" , \"positive affects\" and \"psychological well-being\" . So, good mood is euthymic. But, what about bad mood and suffering which can also not be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics? Life is no rose garden. All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

      "title": "The Phenomenology of Depressive States",
      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

The three most typical symptoms of a depressive illness are: depressed mood; loss of interest and pleasure; and loss of energy and increased fatigue. Anxiety disorders have been found to be correlated more closely than depression with chronic painful conditions in a large US sample of chronic pain patients. Panic disorder comprises severe unpredictable anxiety episodes that can occur \"out of the blue,\" although they are usually more common in one situation than another.

      "title": "Prevalence of Burnout in Bahamian Health Care Personnel",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: For many in the healthcare industry, feelings of exhaustion and low satisfaction with work are commonplace. Thirty years ago, the term “burnout” was coined to describe this state of frustration and fatigue among health and service workers, which arose from excessive demands on their resources.1 Burnout syndrome has primarily been described as a multidimensional process with three central constructs: Emotional Exhaustion or “EE” (feeling emotionally drained and exhausted by one's work), Depersonalization or “DP” (negative or very detached feelings toward clients or patients), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment or “PA” (evaluating oneself negatively and feeling dissatisfied with positive job performance and achievements).2 Burnout is different from stress in that while stress is acute, burnout tends to be chronic and is exacerbated by an accumulation of emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job.2 Burnout is relevant for both healthcare personnel as well as for the patients they serve as it has been associated with negative consequences for both groups.3,4 Burnout can result in decreased morale and increased physician turnover, as well as poor judgment in patient care decision making, increased medical errors, diminished dedication, decreased quality of care, and reduced patient safety all of which can have consequences. It is important for the culture of medicine, for healthcare workers, and for patients, that burnout be identified in practice and its symptoms alleviated. Physicians and healthcare workers are able to provide a higher standard of care when their work satisfaction is high.4 The burden of burnout in healthcare providers is significant. In fact, in the United States, burnout is more common among physicians than any other type of US worker.5 The prevalence of burnout in US physicians was reported at 45.8% in 2011 where physicians reported at least one symptom of burnout and rose to 54% in 2014.5 Its prevalence has been found to range from 17% to 52% in UK physicians6 and 9% to 82% in Middle-Eastern physicians. In all three groups the burnout symptom most commonly reported was EE. While mental well-being has been investigated among Caribbean physicians, burnout has not been studied in this group. Burnout has also been found to affect medical students and residents.7,8 Healthcare personnel (HCP) in the Bahamas were queried to assess the burden of burnout in this group. A convenience sample of HCPs who attended a Scientific Conference at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in the Bahamas was surveyed. In this cross-sectional survey the study population consisted of attending/private practice physicians, resident physicians, and medical students, all of whom practice and train in the Bahamas. The study tool used was the Abbreviated Maslach Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel,8 which participants completed prior to entering the conference. The Abbreviated Maslach Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel measures the three dimensions of burnout—Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Low Personal Accomplishment. For each item, participants were asked to respond, “Every day,” “A few times a week,” “Once a week,” “A few times a month,” “Once a month or less,” “A few times a year,” or “Never.” Each item was scored with a number ranging from 0 to 6; 6 being “Every Day” and 0 being “Never.” It consists of an abbreviated 9 items taken from the original 22, the latter being a gold standard, validated, survey. Sixty-six surveys were returned, some of which had incomplete sections of either PA, DP, or EE. Fifty four respondents answered all of the Personal Accomplishment items, 51 respondents answered all of the Depersonalization items, and 58 respondents answered all of the Emotional Exhaustion items. Most of the respondents were women (49/66; 75%), 41% were attending/private practice physicians and the remainder were resident physicians (16/66; 24%) and medical students (35%; 23/66). Of the three dimensions of burnout, emotional exhaustion was the only one reported as being experienced and it was only reported among resident physicians and medical students. Medical students and residents were significantly more likely to report this dimension. No symptoms of burnout were reported by attending/private practice physicians. In addition, healthcare workers aged 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 reported feelings of burnout in this dimension (emotional exhaustion), while those over the age of 40 did not report burnout in any dimension. Women were also significantly less likely than men to report burnout in the dimension of depersonalization. Neither attending/private practice physicians, resident physicians, nor medical students reported feelings of burnout in the dimensions of depersonalization or personal accomplishment. In summary, Bahamian medical students and resident physicians report burnout symptoms in the dimension of emotional exhaustion, to a significant degree, while practicing physicians did not report experiencing burnout in any dimension. This finding that burnout in the dimension of emotional exhaustion decreases with increased age may be partially explained by the fact that older physicians who are either attendings or private physicians, are able to set their own hours, while resident physicians and medical students are studying and working under unrestricted hours. It could also suggest that Bahamian medical professionals tend to learn how best to cope with their work environment over time through increased feelings of self-efficacy and increased resilience. Those who struggled more and did not experience this change over time may have exited the medical field entirely. A study conducted by Ey et al9 in 2013 found that 87% of residents who were aware of a Resident Wellness Program addressing burdens like burnout would be willing to seek help through the program. In order to promote physician well-being, leaders within organizations, including medical schools, residency programs, hospitals, and healthcare systems have to play a large role.10 Residents and fellows are looking to physician leaders for counseling regarding how to avoid as well as cope with distress in training.8 If burnout is identified and counseling made available, as well as provision of an environment that “cultivates well-being,”10 residents and medical students will benefit in the short term, and will also likely acquire some of the necessary tools to combat burnout throughout their careers. This convenience sample sheds some light on the burden of burnout in this setting. A more rigorous study design using the validated 22-item Maslach survey and securing a larger sample size may allow an improved understanding of burnout in this setting. However, it may be prudent to consider strategies to alleviate burnout and build resilience among medical students and resident physicians in the Bahamas. Importantly, burnout prevention methods must be explored, trialed, and implemented as well.

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "In the large group of psychoneurotic patients, the main emphasis has not to be laid upon the same factors in all the cases. In some cases the disorder of a somatic system plays an important etiological rôle; in some cases there are definite emotional idiosyncrasies; in some patients special experiences have sensitized the patient in certain directions; in some there has been, even with fair equipment and with no obvious disorder of the simple emotional reactions, a balance impossible to maintain for an indefinite period. In some there are personal traits of very special nature which cannot be reduced to simpler elements. In the formulation of each case one must take into account the possibility of a disorder at each of many levels. In working at this large group of patients we still require very much more information as to the rôle played by the simple organic functions, while not neglecting the complicated development of elaborate psychological reactions. The detailed analysis of the special determination of the specific psychological reactions has been carried further than the other lines of investigation, owing to the enthusiasm of the psychoanalytic school. There remains much work to be done in regard to the rôle of the various systems (cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal, etc.) in the setting of the emotional reactions; and the study of the personality along lines analogous to those suggested by Hoch and Amsden is an important field for further research.",

The difficulty of diagnosing such conditions, the inconsistency of their severity with the diagnostic criteria of depressive or anxiety disorders requiring specialized psychiatric care, affect the quality of qualified medical care, increase health care costs, contribute to the chronicization of diseases, deterioration of quality of life and social functioning. An important problem is the safety and effectiveness of therapy of such conditions, preservation of trust in the doctor and the therapeutic process as a whole. The conducted study confirmed the clinical indications for Selank regulatory peptide and its efficacy in the therapy of not only anxiety states, unmotivated anxiety, mood instability, but also somatic manifestations of anxiety and depression, including asthenic, algic (back pain, stomach pain, headache, chest pain) symptom complexes, palpitations, nausea, feeling of weakness, fatigue, sleep disorders and recovery from psychoemotional stress",

The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it. Treatment involves several roles of the doctor and his explicit or implicit use of some psychotherapeutic techniques in his medical practice. Four case histories illustrate these principles.",

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients.

      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

However, since such perception, besides serving as the alarm phase, could also be indicative of other, and often adverse, physiological effects, it has been the subject of much research since the early decades of last century [1-5]. These efforts, which have resulted in a vast body of the very valuable scientific findings, revolve around the physiological processes that stressors prompt in the biologic system; and how they affect its equilibrium, i.e., its homeostasis. But how the physiological processes are triggered through involvement of sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as other systemsthe underlying cause of what can be considered the over-drive engagements of these systemshas seemingly escaped scientific scrutiny and remains unanswered; perhaps because it does not have much bearing on the medical treatments of the ensuing effects of sustained (chronic) stress sensation, and also mainly because much about the details of brain processing of sensory data has not been clearly figured out, though the role of the brain in perception of the world, and life as a whole, has been widely recognized since the enlightenment era; early 17th century. However progress, in last few decades, in understanding modus operandi of the brain, has led to further recognition of the fact that much of the brain operations are computational in nature: It is inferred that brain, and the rest of the nervous system, comprise extensive computational machinery that process all sense-relayed information; using its innate (evolutionary-formulated) instructions, imbedded in its constructs (as patterns), for analyzing events and creating perceptions. In the context of such idealization of the operation of the brain [6], this work is an attempt to throw some light on the puzzle of stress; suggesting a mechanism for creation of its sensation, and the prompting of the physiologic effects.",

      "abstract": "CAN there be a cause-and-effect relationship between a stressful event in a person's life and the onset of a clinically serious and sustained affective disorder, mania, or depression which was not present before the event took place? This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Depression: epidemic or pseudo-epidemic?",
      "abstract": "There are a number of under-examined fault lines running through the medical literature on depression, and current clinical practice in the UK. This chiefly stems from a too exclusively biomedical focus, neglecting the social construction of the human mind. For a start, the term `depression' tends to be used without qualification, as if it was settled that we were always referring to a free-standing biologically-based disorder. Yet in everyday usage, as much by doctors as by the general public, `depression' can mean something figurative or literal, can denote a normal or abnormal state, and if abnormal either an individual symptom or a full-blown disorder. And though depression-as-disease may have acquired the status of a natural science category, this was an achievement rather than a discovery: the history of the concept demonstrates the gradual incorporation of a Western cultural vocabulary of guilt, energy, fatigue and stress.1\r\n\r\nOrthodox teaching has been that a `functional shift', the presence of so-called biological features, points to medically significant depression (and responsiveness to anti-depressants). But, bar a small subset of severe cases, there is no reliable demarcation of depression from ordinary unhappiness or misery on this basis. Poor sleep and concentration, weight loss, reduced motivation and drive, anhedonia, etc. (as well as suicidal ideas), not uncommonly accompany ordinary misery as well.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, just before the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners began a Defeat Depression campaign, they surveyed lay people's attitudes to depression and its treatment.2 The views they elicited tended to portray depression in terms of emotional problems, like unhappiness, caused primarily by social and situational factors, and not something to take to general practitioners (GPs). Of the 2003 people polled, 78% saw anti-depressants as addictive, and liable to dull symptoms rather than solve the problem. The Royal Colleges seem to have been undeterred by these findings, which were rather at odds with their view of `depression' as straightforwardly connoting a psychiatric disorder. Indeed the Royal Colleges initiated the Defeat Depression campaign because they believed that 50% of people with depression did not consult their GPs. They wanted to increase this figure. But was the lay view wrong? We can see here how professional pronouncements can contribute to a blurring between unpleasant but commonplace mental states, part of life, and those associated with objective dysfunction and breakdown, meriting medical attention.\r\n\r\nThe other explicitly stated reason for the campaign was the belief that GPs often missed depression anyway. Since then the notion that there were large numbers of undiagnosed cases has been remarkably tenacious. Why? There is, in fact, no sound evidence for an epidemic of depression (as psychiatric disorder) in the UK. On the other hand, the case for an epidemic of antidepressant prescribing is now cast iron. In Britain prescriptions rose from 9 million to 21 million during the 1990s, and in the USA have doubled in only 5 years—mirroring the production and marketing of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressants.\r\n\r\nWhat remains striking is how unrobust the evidence base for antidepressants still is, particularly for the mild/moderate cases that account for the majority of all prescriptions.3 Part of the reason is surely that antidepressants will not cure human misery, whether presenting in primary care or in psychiatric clinics. Indeed many of those difficult cases described in psychiatric journals as having `treatment resistant depression' may be `resistant' precisely for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this repeatedly aired assumption about under-recognition at primary care level has itself led GPs to prescribe more readily. Further, some GPs prescribe for low mood per se, even if other features of the syndrome are absent, and the simpler dose regimens of SSRIs by comparison with tricyclics have helped. Patient feedback is influenced by placebo effects, and by factors like nonspecific sedation that have nothing to do with `antidepression'. People whose record indicates prior prescription of anti-depressants are more likely to be prescribed them again at a later time by other doctors. It remains to be seen if NICE guidelines—which do not recommend antidepressants as the primary intervention in `mild/moderate' cases, make a difference to these trends.4\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical promotion of SSRIs made much of the claim to have fewer side-effects than the tricyclics, and this contributed to the confidence with which GPs recommended them to patients. In view of the public concern about addictive effects evident in the survey described above, it is ironic that discontinuation reactions are now emerging as a distinct clinical problem (extending to litigation against doctors in the USA), both in SSRIs and in other new anti-depressants like venlafaxine.\r\n\r\nThe weak construct validity of psychiatric categories, and the dominance of empiricism over theoretical development, are overarching issues for the psychiatric profession.5 Both are apparent in the discourse about depression. So, too, is a lack of explicit reflection on the ideological and societally-framed nature of medical practice, which would need to take account of cultural shifts in attitudes to adversity and the emergence of an expressive, less stoical individualism.6 The surge in anti-depressant prescribing is as much a cultural trend as a medical one, reflecting the rise of a medicalization and professionalization of everyday life and its problems across Western societies.7\r\n\r\nThere is also an important international dimension. `Depression' is said to contribute 12% of the total burden of nonfatal global disease.8 The World Health Organization describes it as an epidemic that within two decades will be second only to cardiovascular disease in terms of global disease burden. But `depression' has no exact equivalent in non-Western cultures, not least because these do not share a Western ethnopsychology that defines `emotion' as internal, often biological, unintentioned, distinct from cognition, and a feature of individuals rather than situations.9 Non-Western peoples would tend to see the problem in situational and moral terms (as some Western citizens still do, as evidenced by the survey described above), though when they migrate to the West they become more likely to ascribe to a depression-as-disease model.10 This is to highlight the work of culture and its opinion formers—including the medical profession—in shaping a particular interpretation of the world.\r\n\r\nThus the use of Western-derived quantitative instruments to estimate population prevalences worldwide is likely to commit a category fallacy, which is the assumption that mental and bodily state phenomena mean the same thing in whatever setting they are detected. There is no such thing as depression, if by this we mean (as the WHO appear to mean) a unitary, universally valid, pathological entity requiring medical intervention. Such claims seem a serious distortion, one serving to deflect attention away from what millions of people might cite as the basis of their misery, like poverty and lack of rights. The one clear-cut beneficiary would be the pharmaceutical industry, with its vested interest in the biologization of the human predicament.",

Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

      "abstract": "Summary There is a popular conviction that psychological disturbance is invariably a reaction to environmental events. This approach is associated with total rejection of the so-called ‘medical model’. However, allowance must be made for the fact that contemporary knowledge of psychiatric illness is well behind what is now known about general medicine, and current ideas about psychiatric aetiology may be emotionally determined to give satisfying concepts which are often almost impossible to refute. By tracing the progress of some hypotheses in general medicine, as they developed in the past, there are similarities with some current observations about the methods of action of physical treatments in psychiatry, treatments which have been discovered empirically. There is a widespread assumption that psychological responses relate precisely to the degree of evoking stress or the patient's personal attitudes to the stress. However, emotional responsiveness may show an intrinsic individual variation so that many patients who over-respond to stress may do so because of enhanced responsiveness rather than necessarily because psychological events have brought about a state of vulnerability. The exclusively dynamic approach to psychiatry has been perhaps unnecessarily encouraged by naming an illness ‘endogenous depression’ which could well be a primarily physical metabolic disturbance in the central nervous system but which happens to present with prominent depression, as well as other abnormalities. The emphasis on the component of depressed mood artificially delineates the illness and tends to impede consideration of its wider implications.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms are frequently present in patients with late-life depression.The designation \"anxious depression\" has been used to describe major depressive disorder (MDD) accompanied by clinically significant but subsyndromal anxiety symptoms.MDD may also present comorbid with diagnosable anxiety disorders, although this presentation is less common in late life.Diagnosis of anxious depression in the elderly is complicated by several factors (eg, their tendency to experience and report psychiatric symptoms as somatic illness) and is associated with a more severe clinical presentation, increased risk for suicidal ideation, increased disability, and poorer prognosis.Standard pharmacotherapy for depression may be sufficient but for many patients must be modified or augmented.Psychosocial interventions may also be an important component in the treatment of these patients, although no specific psychosocial treatments have been developed for late-life anxious depression.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent one of the leading problems of the public health community in the modern world today, especially because their incidence is steadily increasing and they are one of the main reasons for the overall disease burden in Europe. One of the most frequently diagnosed, yet under recognized diseases, is depression. Depression, whether a symptom, part of a syndrome or an independent diagnosis, is characterized by feelings of sadness, loss of interest and pleasure in activities that normally bring joy to a person, and can affect how a person feels, thinks and behaves. It affects all age and social groups, as well as both sexes, it is often comorbid with other physical diseases, and increases the risk of developing other physical diseases. There are certain differences between the sexes in the prevalence, the way a certain sex group deals with problems caused by depression, and the possible causes of these differences, which we present in more detail in this paper. Differences are observed in all cultures, environments and across different age groups. Patients suffering from depression have a particularly high risk of committing suicide. Suicide is a psychopathological phenomenon of multifactorial aetiology that is most often associated with psychiatry and mental disorders and is not a diagnosis in itself, but a complication of many psychiatric disorders. here are many differences in the rate of suicide by age and sex, as well as in the method of suicide, which we also present in more detail in this paper.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

The existence and characteristics of such putative predisposing personality patterns has been the subject of considerable discussion in psychiatric and psychoanalytic literature, the reliability of which, when subjected to critical review, is compromised seriously by method ological and other inadequacies. For instance, the association of obsessive personality and involutional depression rests on tenuous grounds. There is enough evidence for depressogenic potential of the socalled oral or dependent personality as described by psychoanalysts, especially in the case of major (manic-depressive) illnesses, to warrant further investigation.",

Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

      "abstract": "One of frequent presentations of multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic fatigue that may be determined as a subjective decrease of the physic and/or psychic energy level. Fatigue can be divided into asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (exhaustion during physical loading) and fatigue concomitant with other symptoms (MS exacerbation). There are central as well as peripheral mechanisms of fatigue formation. Frequent is a combination of fatigue and affective disorders in MS, in particular depression, as well as sleep disturbances (insomnia, restless legs syndrome) that may indicate the common origin of their mechanisms, i.e. reduction of serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems activity. Endocrinal and autoimmune components are considered as important in fatigue syndrome formation, the latter exerting more influence on asthenia than on pathological fatigability. Further investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms of asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (fatigue in active state) and specification of their differential diagnostic features allow not only to understand the essence of this syndrome but to choose an adequate individualized therapy.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Persistent headache, in particular, evokes concerns about an otherwise-overlooked underlying cause, although many chronic headaches are also primary (without a single underlying cause) in nature. The “state of the art” of pharmacotherapy for this primary headache syndrome is very much a work in progress. The recognition of a migraine component, or of psychological comorbidities is very important for these patients. Key nonpharmacological interventions are often most useful.",

Neurochemical, existential, sociogenic, familial, pathological, psychodynamic and behavioural explanations have all been offered as putative reasons for the psychological disorder, which in its various representations (panic disorder, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, phobias, post‐traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorders, etc.) can affect up to 20% of the population on a lifetime basis (1). Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "As emotional distress is often seen as an understandable reaction to a severe or life-threatening illness, clinicians are reluctant to make a diagnosis of depression and resort to alternative diagnoses such as adjustment disorder (AD) or demoralisation. This paper introduces these concepts and critically examines their clinical utility. It concludes that neither AD nor demoralisation can be clearly distinguished from depression on variables such as clinical symptoms, outcome or treatment response. Since AD and demoralisation are considered transient or understandable reactions, the risk of using these diagnoses as alternatives to depression in a clinical setting is that a simplistic approach of psychological therapies for the former and antidepressants for the latter will be adopted. Instead, a working diagnosis of a general distress syndrome complemented by a personalised formulation is advocated. This would lead to the generation of a problem list and a pragmatic management plan.",

The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels.

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Once considered relatively uncommon, it is frequently encountered in clinical practice, particularly in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Psychotically depressed patients respond poorly to antidepressants, but remission is likely with neuroleptic-antidepressant combinations or electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotic depression may be unipolar or bipolar with early or late onset and may be more likely to occur in patients with a history of childhood psychic trauma. Much is known about the course and treatment response of obvious presentations of psychotic depression, but more must be learned about depressed patients who have intermittent, subtle, or mild psychotic symptoms and about the ways in which the capacity to become psychotic interacts with the capacity to become depressed to produce a syndrome greater than the sum of its parts.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

In this context the paper elucidates the conceptual horizon of anxiety, stretching from its status as «normal», essential element of conditio humana, to representing a symptom of another (somatic or mental) illness and to constituting a psychiatric disorder of its own. In any case of acute dyspnoea it is important to «normalize» the patient's anxiety, i.e. to contextualize it as a comprehensible reaction to the stressing experience and not as proof of personal weakness. If dyspnoea and anxiety occur in a patient with a preexisting psychiatric disorder, defining the appropriate therapeutic steps will be more complex and demanding, especially with regard to a targeted interdisciplinary cooperation (consultation liaison psychiatry). The paper highlights the principles of psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutical interventions, a stable therapeutical relationship always defining the center of any treatment procedure.Dyspnoe und Angst.Eine akut auftretende Dyspnoe, auf Deutsch nicht ohne Grund meist «Atemnot» genannt, löst immer Verunsicherung und Angst aus. Der Beitrag leuchtet in diesem Kontext den Horizont des Phänomens Angst aus. Dieser reicht vom «normalen», essentiellen Element der conditio humana über den Status als Symptom einer anderen (somatischen oder psychischen) Erkrankung bis hin zur Angst als eigenständiger psychischer Erkrankung. In der somatischen Akutsituation einer Dyspnoe kommt der «Normalisierung» von Angst eine besondere Bedeutung zu, also das Einordnen der Angst als nachvollziehbare Reaktion auf die Belastung und nicht etwa als Ausdruck persönlicher Schwäche. Treten Dyspnoe und Angst bei einer Person mit einer vorbestehenden psychischen Erkrankung auf, stellen sich bei der Therapie besondere Herausforderungen, vor allem hinsichtlich einer gezielten interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit (Konsil- und Liaisonpsychiatrie). Die Prinzipien psychopharmakologischer und psychotherapeutischer Interventionen werden herausgearbeitet, wobei die tragfähige therapeutische Beziehung stets im Zentrum steht.",

Psychological difficulties are typically the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. As such, having a vascular malformation will not result in the same psychological outcomes for each young person. Having a new healthy baby is a known stressor that can precipitate a range of stress-related reactions in parents, including major mental health difficulties. When a child has physical health differences, the stress can increase as a result of uncertainty about the infant's health and development and the extra health care burden of hospital attendances and daily management at home.",

      "title": "Guidelines in the management of diabetic nerve pain clinical utility of pregabalin",
      "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. It presents as a variety of syndromes for which there is no universally accepted unique classification. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin.",

      "title": "Acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder are all psychiatric consequences of traumatic experiences. Because trauma is so common in medical practice, in the form of accidents, severe illness, and sometimes medical and surgical treatments, these disorders are commonly seen by physicians. An initial severe reaction to a traumatic event such as severe accident is an acute stress disorder and is commonly characterized by dissociation. A more long-lasting emotional reaction to ongoing stress such as a new diagnosis of life-threatening illness is termed an adjustment disorder. An often longer-lasting and more severe psychological reaction associated with repeated mental re-experiencing of the traumatic event is called post-traumatic stress disorder. These trauma-related disorders are not only an important cause of suffering but may also complicate medical care, hence they require recognition and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation.

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

This requires a full understanding of the patient's illness dynamics, which inform primary care clinicians as to the specific psychological needs to be addressed during the course of medical treatment.

Medical psychotherapy can then be implemented either as a supportive or introspective approach and sometimes supplemented with pharmacotherapy, if the patient's emotional distress is extreme.

      "abstract": "Depression has different types and causes and is considered a global health problem.In general, according to the DMS-5, the types of depression vary depending on the duration of the episodes, severity and set of symptoms present.For this study, regarding the consequences of this disorder, the definition used by DeCS (Descriptors in Health Science) for depressive disorder was considered: \"Affective disorder that manifests itself both in a dysphoric mood and in the loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities\".Depression is also related to impaired transmission in some central aminergic synapses, due to defects in the production, transfer or loss of amines, which negatively affect the individual in their daily activities, making them unproductive and depressed, which leads to carriers often commit suicide.Furthermore, this disorder can be discussed regarding the dysregulation of neurotransmitters and hormones that are important for the sensation of pleasure, reward and happiness.It is therefore inferred that this study's general objective is to determine the effects of physical exercise on the health -physical, mental and social -of people with depressive disorders.In order to present a clear and objective treatment alternative for carrier patients, the present study used the databases compiled in BVMS (MS Virtual Health Library) and PUBMED to explain the effects observed in individuals.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli.

The concept of mind and associated mood states defended here is that they are physically emergent, subjective, qualitative, unified features of the brain. We compared our neurobiological assessment also to psychoanalytical practice (first person's perspective). Argument Applied to recent work on major depressive disorder ( MDD ), our ideas are among other supported by clinical and experimental studies on sleep deprivation, deep brain stimulation and epidemiological assessments of time‐to‐recovery. Clinical implications We suggest that depression is a transient state of the brain, that is mutually exclusive to the state of pleasure (in the F reudian context), rather than a disorder or disease with a characteristic time course (like many reversible somatic diseases). MDD can best be described with stochastic transition models, which is discussed in the context of a presumed brain serotonin dysfunction in depression. Our ideas invite a reconsideration of some concepts underlying current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the clinical practice.",

Physical or psychological demands, known as stressors, can cause strain. Stress can be identified as the process in the body for adapting to influences, changes, demands, and strains to which it is exposed. Stress caused by a working environment is known as occupational stress and globally considered to be among the topmost serious health issues. Stress and burnout have reached all-time highs across various professions as stressors have become assiduous and indeterminate - employers and employees alike are scrambling to return to normalcy in the working environment. Burnout results from the physical, mental, and psychological reactions from experiencing prolonged stress. Burnout, considered an occupational phenomenon rather than a medical condition, is often exacerbated with depression and anxiety leading to concerns of employee well-being and mental health. The progressive escalation of occupational stress and burnout has gained attention from global organizations and as the nature of work continues to evolve, understanding occupational stress can support initiatives for managing it.",

Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict.

      "abstract": "Stress is a natural phenomenon designed to serve as the body's natural survival reaction to real or perceived threats. It is a complex and multifaceted function and its purpose is to allow organisms to adapt quickly to a potentially dangerous situation, promoting an individual's likelihood of survival. Stress levels peak markedly in a 'fight or flight' incident, then reduce again after danger has passed. Stress is designed to work in an acute situation, but when the stress becomes chronic – as is often the case in many modern lifestyles – the body remains constantly on high alert, potentially causing a number of stress-related symptoms.

The noun affect refers to feelings, emotions and mood. The most common affective disorders are depression, which is characterized by low or depressed mood. This chapter discusses these and the bipolar disorders, which are often characterized by extreme mood swings from heightened elation or mania to deep depression, or vice versa. It talks about clinical features of major depressive disorder (MDD), its subtypes, stress, learned helplessness and the causes and treatments for depression. Current management of MDD involves the use of antidepressant drugs together with psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Drugs that inhibit the synthesis of cortisol or inhibit the action of glutamate are presently under investigation for the use as antidepressant medication.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – An Overview",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that result in psychological trauma.This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.As an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent but more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and sometimes crippling condition and develops in a significant proportion of individuals exposed to trauma, and untreated, can continue for years.Its symptoms can affect every life domain -physiological, psychological, occupational, and social.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980, making it one of the more recently accepted psychiatric disorders.PTSD is one of the few DSM diagnoses to have a recognizable etiologic agent, in that it must develop in direct response to a severe (sudden, terrifying, or shocking) life event (American Psychiatric Association 2000).Since the introduction of PTSD into DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980), the disorder has been documented in children exposed to traumas such as domestic violence, natural disasters, medical trauma (such as hospitalization or medical procedures performed on children), war, terrorism, and community violence.According to the American Psychological Association, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, such as terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes, or military combat [1].\"PTSD is a problem in which the human brain continues to react with nervousness after the horrific trauma even though the original trauma is over.Brain can react by staying in \"overdrive\" and being hyperalert in preparation for the next possible trauma.Sometimes the brain continues to \"remember\" the trauma by having \"flashbacks\" about the event or nightmares even though the trauma was in the past. Historical backgroundReports of battle-associated stress reactions appeared as early as the 6th century BC.One of the first descriptions of PTSD was made by the Greek historian Herodotus.In 490 BC www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 4 Herodotus described, during the Battle of Marathon, an Athenian soldier who suffered no injury from war but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier.In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with \"exhaustion\" after the stress of battle.This \"exhaustion\" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma.Soldiers during the 19th century were not supposed to be scared or show any fear in the midst of battle.The only treatment for this \"exhaustion\" was to bring the afflicted back for a bit for a short term therapy and then send them back into battle.During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\"Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include railway spine, stress syndrome, shell shock, battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many military conflicts, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the war in Vietnam.In its initial DSM-III (formulation 1980), a traumatic event was conceptualized as a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human experience.The framers of the original PTSD diagnosis had in mind events such as war, torture, rape, the Nazi Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcano eruptions) and human-made disasters (such as factory explosions, airplane crashes, and automobile accidents).They considered traumatic events as clearly different from the very painful stressors that constitute the normal vicissitudes of life such as divorce, failure, rejection, serious illness and financial reverses.(By this logic adverse psychological responses to such \"ordinary stressors\" would, in DSM-III terms, be characterized as Adjustment Disorders rather than PTSD.)This dichotomization between traumatic and other stressors was based on the assumption that although most individuals have the ability to cope with ordinary stress, their adaptive capacities are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic stressor.The DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD were revised in DSM-III-R (1987) and DSM-IV (1994) [2].A very similar syndrome is classified in .Since 1980 there has been a great deal of attention devoted to the development of instruments for assessing PTSD.Although an optimal evaluation of a patient for PTSD consists of a face-to-face interview by a mental health professional trained in diagnosing psychiatric disorders, several instruments are available to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These include screening tools, diagnostic instruments, and trauma and symptom severity scales.For example, there are brief screening tools, such as the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Screen, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; self-report screening instruments, such as the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale; and structured or semi-structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (DIS-IV), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI), www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 6 Country PTSD DALY rate, overall PTSD DALY rate, females PTSD DALY rate, males Thailand 59 86 30 Indonesia",

      "title": "Clinical Effectiveness of Tofrānil in the Treatment of Depressive Psychoses",
      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

A diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, or recurrent severe depressive illness, is, at best, a lifelong vulnerability and, at worst, a continuous chronic condition with serious associated disabilities. Like many physical chronic diseases, such an illness demands of the individual and those closest to them acceptance of a highly unpalatable diagnosis, adjustments in lifestyle and life expectations, and the often unwelcome realities of long-term treatment and service involvement— if relapse and long-term disability are to be minimized. As with other chronic diseases, the organization of care needs to include a greater emphasis on certain key elements.",

      "title": "Disability Evaluation in Psychiatric Illness and the Concept of Hysteria",
      "abstract": "In the evaluation of disability resulting from hysteria, conversion or psycho-physiological reactions, consideration should be given to the clinical effects resulting from the disturbed, or actual loss of function upon the physiological homeostasis of the patient, as well as his personal activities on a day-to-day basis. While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

Further, psychosocial problems often are addressed only superficially or not at all during office visits. The challenge is to integrate quality-of-life issues into clinical practice and to better assess the patient's perception of the disorder, the seizures, and the medications, as they impact on cognitive function, emotional well-being, and social and economic functioning.",

The episode usually fits within a bipolar disorder, in which also depressive episodes occur. These episodes often precede the manic phase. When a first manic episode occurs at a later age without any personal history, a somatic cause must always be excluded. Lateonset mania is associated with increased somatic comorbidity in patients aged 50 years and older. [2]",

Public awareness and acknowledgment of depressions and other affective states have increased during the 1970s, and growing numbers of persons with depressive symptoms are seeking medical attention. Epidemiologic studies show that perhaps 15% to 30% of all adults experience depressive symptoms at some time during their lives. Depressions occur about twice as frequently among women as among men and often occur during the highly productive years of young adulthood. The term \"depression\" refers to a mood state, a symptom, or a group of clinical syndromes. Feelings of sadness, disappointment, and frustration are a normal component of the human condition. However, when the sadness interferes with normal functioning, medical intervention may be helpful. Dysphorias may be due to concurrent medical, social, or other psychiatric problems. The syndrome of clinical depression is distinguished from the symptom",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Ansiedad y depresión: el problema de la diferenciación a través de los síntomas",
      "abstract": "El problema de la diferenciacion de los sintomas entre ansiedad y depresion, constituye una de las grandes preocupaciones en la psicopatologia, dadas las profundas implicaciones para las tareas diagnosticas y de intervencion. La problematica referida anteriormente se ve reflejada en los datos de vigilancia epidemiologica, segun los cuales se indica una fuerte comorbilidad entre ambos tipos de trastorno, sin que llegue a establecerse con precision cual antecede o predispone al otro, o si se trata de una confusion entre ambos trastornos, dada la presencia de sintomas comunes. Este ultimo hecho se hace mas evidente cuando se considera que muchos de los sintomas tradicionalmente atribuidos a la ansiedad, tambien se presentan en la depresion y viceversa, asi como los casos en los que algunos sintomas pueden llegar a constituirse en cuadros clinicos completos. Ante el panorama anterior, surge la inquietud por la identificacion de las caracteristicas de los trastornos de ansiedad frente a los trastornos del estado de animo, entre ellos el trastorno de la depresion; mas aun , desde que en los manuales diagnosticos vigentes ambos tipos de trastornos se encuentran plenamente descritos, aunque la diferenciacion clinica, al comparar los criterios, sea verdaderamente critica. Una posible explicacion al solapamiento de los sintomas entre ansiedad y depresion (para referirse de manera general a ambos tipos de trastorno), ha sido clasicamente atribuida a comorbilidad, es decir a la presencia coexistente de ambos cuadros en muchos de los casos clinicos. Sin embargo, esta explicacion circular no deja del todo satisfechos ni a los clinicos ni a los investigadores. Por otro lado, dicha concurrencia de sintomas se atribuye a un asunto de instrumentos de evaluacion. Asi, se plantea como los trastornos dependen de las herramientas con que se midan, las cuales siguen un modelo teorico explicativo acerca de la etiologia, el curso, el pronostico y la sintomatologia asociada. De esta forma, los instrumentos tienen un sesgo implicito en cuanto a que privilegian un aspecto especifico en funcion de como se definen los trastornos, y dejan muchas veces por fuera otros aspectos tambien definitorios. De acuerdo con lo anterior y en relacion directa con la depresion, el presente estudio indica que la evaluacion se caracteriza por la multiplicidad de instrumentos disenados para este fin, asi como por la diversidad de contenidos que evaluan, de tal forma que se hace dificil establecer los sintomas caracteristicos cuando pocos sintomas coinciden a traves de las distintas herramientas de evaluacion. En la misma linea, se indica como las instrucciones dadas a los sujetos para responder a los cuestionarios, suelen confundir medidas de frecuencia con medidas de gravedad; esto nos lleva a la discusion clasica, acerca del caracter dimensional frente al caracter categorial de la depresion. Una alternativa explicativa de la presencia de sintomas compartidos entre ansiedad y depresion, se encuentra en el planteamiento de la existencia de un factor de afectividad negativa, compartido por ambos tipos de trastornos, de tal forma que en este nucleo se agruparian los sintomas que suelen ser comunes, mientras que habria otro componente especifico de la ansiedad que se refiere a la activacion fisiologica y un componente especifico, para la depresion, en relacion a la baja afectividad positiva. Asi, la ansiedad se definiria en funcion de una alta afectividad negativa y una alta activacion fisiologica (arousal), mientras que la depresion se caracterizaria por una alta afectividad negativa y una baja afectividad positiva. De acuerdo con los elementos senalados, se insiste en la importancia de disponer de adecuadas y fiables herramientas de evaluacion que contribuyan a la identificacion precisa de los distintos trastornos, que aporten datos en apoyo de procesos de intervencion mas eficaces, para el decremento de los trastornos mentales y su incidencia dentro de la salud mental de las comunidades. En este sentido, Spielberger y cols. ofrecen un instrumento de evaluacion cuyo objetivo es diferenciar aspectos caracteristicos de la depresion mediante el uso de dos escalas diferenciadas (estado y rasgo), con lo que se intenta aportar elementos que ayudan a esclarecer el panorama del diagnostico clinico de la depresion.",

      "abstract": "Post-stroke mood and emotional disturbances are frequent and diverse in their manifestations. Among them, post-stroke depression is the best known. Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

So ist es einerseits gut bekannt, dass psychische und soziale Faktoren, „Stress“ oder auch eine Depression einen unabhängigen Risikofaktor für das Auftreten von Schlaganfällen darstellen. Umgekehrt ist es aber auch so, dass der Schlaganfall selbst zu tiefgreifenden psychischen Folgen führen kann. Insbesondere die Post-Schlaganfall-Depression spielt hier eine wichtige Rolle. Sie tritt in mindestens 1/3 aller Schlaganfall-Patienten auf und ist mit einem schlechten „Outcome“ sowie einer erhöhten Sterblichkeit assoziiert. Klinische wie experimentelle Untersuchungen aus den letzten Jahren haben zum Verständnis der vielfältigen Beziehungen zwischen Schlaganfall und Psyche beigetragen. Insbesondere die vielversprechenden Ergebnisse der FLAME-Studie, welche eine verbesserte neurologische Erholung bei der frühen Gabe von Antidepressiva bei Schlaganfall-Pa­tienten zeigte, eröffnet nun die klinische Frage, ob Schlaganfall-Patienten generell bereits zu einem frühen Zeitpunkt mit Antidepressiva behandelt werden sollten.",

Освен това депресията често идва със симптоми на безпокойство. Тя може да доведе до различни емоционални и физически проблеми и да намали способността на човек да функционира на работното място и у дома. Депресията е различна от колебанията в настроението, които хората изпитват като част от нормалния живот. Временните емоционални отговори на предизвикателствата на ежедневието не представляват депресия. Депресията и тревожните разстройства са различни, но хората с депресия често изпитват симптоми, подобни на тези на тревожно разстройство, като нервност, раздразнителност и проблеми със съня и концентрацията. Но всяко разстройство има свои собствени причини и собствени емоционални и поведенчески симптоми. Много хора, които развиват депресия, имат история на тревожно разстройство по-рано в живота си. Няма данни, че едно разстройство причинява другото, но има ясни доказателства, че много хора страдат от двете заболявания. Депресивните разстройства включват две основни подкатегории: тежко депресивно разстройство / депресивен епизод, което включва симптоми като депресивно настроение, загуба на интерес и намалена енергия. В зависимост от броя и тежестта на симптомите депресивният епизод може да бъде категоризиран като лек, умерен или тежък. Дистимия, персистираща или хро нична форма на лека депресия. Симптомите на дистимия са подобни на депресивен период, но са склонни да бъдат по-малко интензивни и да продължават по-дълго. Депресията е рисков фактор за суицидни мисли (има много повече опити за самоубийство, отколкото завършени действия). Депресията засяга 350 милиона души. Търсенето на ограничаване на депресията и други състояния на психичното здраве се увеличават в световен мащаб.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Deep dyspareunia: a narrative review of impact on sexual function and quality of life",
      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

It causes suffering to many who go undiagnosed, and it burdens families and institutions providing care for the elderly by disabling those who might otherwise be able-bodied. What makes depression in the elderly so insidious is that neither the victim nor the health care provider may recognize its symptoms in the context of the multiple physical problems of many elderly people. Depressed mood, the typical signature of depression, may be less prominent than other depressive symptoms such as loss of appetite, sleeplessness, anergia, and loss of interest in, and enjoyment of, the normal pursuits of life. There is a wide spectrum of depressive symptoms as well as types of available therapies. Because of the many physical illnesses and social and economic problems of the elderly, individual health care providers often conclude that depression is a normal consequence",

If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms.

Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "title": "Feeling emotional: the amygdala links emotional perception and experience",
      "abstract": "The term ‘emotion’ most commonly denotes a specific phenomenal state, such as the solemn weightiness associated with sadness or the lightness of being associated with joy. Human affective neuroscience has begun to pin down the elusive neuroanatomy of these most experientially prominent of mental experiences. One of the brain structures consistently associated with emotional functioning is the amygdaloid complex (Phan et al., 2002). Numerous neuroimaging studies have shown the amygdala varies with emotional experience in both healthy and mood disordered populations, pointing to its central role in emotional phenomenology. One difficulty with this apparent association is that emotion like cognition is not a single entity but is a multi-component process. Emotions reflect a constellation of diverse but correlated central neurocognitive and peripheral physiologic events. For example, witnessing a gruesome automobile accident is highly negatively valent, may involve specific appraisals related to fear or sadness, results in central and peripheral autonomic arousal, is attention grabbing thereby demanding to be the central focus of awareness, and in the following months and years may be associated with vivid reminiscences. In the safer confines of the lab or the bore of an MRI scanner, the amygdala has been associated to some extent with all of these putative functions. As such, amygdala activity may represent the generation of emotional experience itself, and/or it may reflect sundry aspects of emotional information processing correlated with emotional experience. In this issue, Feldman Barrett et al. demonstrate amygdala responses represent a critical nexus between the propensity for emotional experience and emotional interactions with perceptual encoding. The amygdala's role in feeling emotions may be tied to enhanced sensitivity toward emotional perception.\r\n\r\nFeldman Barrett et al. examined amygdala activation and its relation to emotional experience through the use of experience sampling. For 1 month three times daily, participants were probed via handheld PDA to indicate their present emotional state. One year following, participants were presented with backwardly masked fearful facial expressions during fMRI to index sensitivity of perceptual encoding of emotional events. Individual differences in propensity for negative affect, as indexed by experience sampling, were correlated with magnitude of amygdala response to presented fear faces. Moreover, in participants reporting increased anxiety during scanning, amygdala responses were associated with enhanced perceptual encoding of faces as indicated by increased fusiform activity. These results suggest that the amygdala may contribute to emotional experience by setting the appropriate preconditions for its expression: enhancing attention and associated perceptual encoding of emotional events, and thereby increasing their subjective salience.\r\n\r\nConsidering the mounting neuroimaging evidence consistent with an important role of the amygdala in generating affective experience there is surprisingly little direct evidence of disordered emotional experience following amygdala damage (Anderson and Phelps 2000; Anderson and Phelps 2002; Tranel et al., 2006), compared with evidence of the amygdala's central role in the emotional enhancement of mnemonic (Cahill et al., 1995) and perceptual processes (Anderson and Phelps 2001; Vuilleumier et al., 2004; Adolphs et al., 2005). For instance, patients with amygdala lesions provide retrospective reports of affective states (daily reflections) and traits (yearly reflections) of similar magnitude, frequency and underlying covariance structure to healthy controls (Anderson and Phelps, 2002). When asked to relive emotions, examinations of facial efference reveal that patients with bilateral amygdala damage display remarkably intact emotional expressions, including fear, despite pronounced impairments in the perception of these same signals (Anderson and Phelps, 2000). The results of such lesion studies, however, regard introspective emotional experiences that are associated with complex abstract factors and not directly tied to momentary environmental events. Many emotional experiences involve ruminations upon the past or future, thereby involving representations of threats and rewards in the absence of in the moment environmental stimulation. Such forms of emotional replay and forecasting may depend upon evolutionary more recent prefrontal neocortical representations rather than the amygdala alone. By contrast, the results of Feldman-Barrett et al. suggest that the amygdala's role is more related to momentary experiential states and enhanced attention and sensitivity toward encoding events surrounding these states.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is neuroanatomically positioned to make a rapid and coarse appraisal of the state of the world, and via robust feedback projections, alter the perceptual process by enhancing the encoding of events of potential self importance. Neuroimaging studies have shown that emotionally arousing scenes vigorously engage early primary and secondary visual cortex (Bradley et al., 2003). Emotions thus bias attention to focus on events associated with subjective and physiologic arousal, shaping the ultimate contents of awareness (Anderson, 2005). Such arousal based modulatory effects depend on the integrity of the amygdala, with amygdala lesions eliminating the subjective biasing of perception toward the significant relative to the mundane, rendering the attentional landscape flat (Anderson and Phelps, 2001). Directly corroborating the results of Feldman-Barrett, enhanced extrastriate cortical responses to facial expressions of fear are correlated with magnitude of amygdala response (Morris et al., 1998), and these enhanced extrastriate responses are abolished following amygdala damage (Vuilleumier et al., 2004). The amygdala's role in evaluating the emotional value of fearful faces similarly depends on the ability to correctly attend to and encode their important features (Adolphs et al., 2005). If all the world's a stage, then the amygdala may be the emotional spotlight, shedding light on the most dramatic players of our life story.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala may thus represent embodied attention—the crucial link between central (mental) and peripheral (bodily) resources. Attention and awareness should be coupled with information of sufficient importance to result in autonomic activation and associated mobilization of peripheral metabolic resources, such as through altered respiration and heart rate. This redirecting of bodily physiologic resources may serve as the common primitive foundations of both attention and emotional experience. This common origin supports why emotional states are strongly correlated with how we think about and perceive the environment (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005; Rowe et al, 2007). More than a simple correlation, Feldman-Barrett et al.'s results suggest that emotional experience and individual differences therein may critically depend upon how we attend to the world (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005). Rather than being an ancillary consequence of, altered attention to emotional events may be part and parcel of emotional experience itself.",

Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction.

DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "abstract": "Many authors have investigated the role of psychic factors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypertension. Experimental studies have confirmed that the emotional stress induces a longterm blood pressure increase. Psychophysiologic investigations have revealed that patients with essential hypertension, when compared to the healthy population, are characterized by prompt reactions at the very initial stage of the disease, accompanied by an elevation of the biochemical and vegetative functional parameters, blood pressure in particular. It is in concordance with findings that hypertonics have hemodynamic reactions at rest quite similar to those found in normotonics under the emotional stress. Certain psychosocial factors cannot be identified as absolute causes of the disease. Their particular role varies from person to person. It depends on particular personality features whether any of these factors will be experienced as a stress. It has therefore been assumed that hypertension is a concomitant vegetative phenomenon, typical for people who have a permanent feeling of anger or for ambitious people who are under a permanent pressure of striving for success. Numerous psychological investigations have led to a conclusion that hypertonics have psychological troubles which cannot generally be considered as specific for hypertension. The question concerning the part played by such behaviour as the primary cause of the disease is still to be answered. Doubtlessly, such behaviour is frequent in hypertonics and it probably contributes to persistence of the disease, since they are more apt to stressogenic situations. These findings have resulted in formulating the therapeutic strategies with psychophysiologic orientation. At the physiological level, they resolve the increased excitement and lower the excessive reactivity of the vegetative nervous system, whereas on the psychological level, applying psychotherapy methods, they achieve both cognitive and behavioural changes.",

      "title": "TWO CASES OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS DEVELOPING AFTER SEVERE MENTAL EMOTION AND SHOCK",
      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "Insomnia Caused by Medical and Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of biopsychosocial model of health and pathology that is nowadays widely recognized in the different fields of modern medicine the mind, building the core of personality and the brain as the central regulatory organ play an essential role in the interdisciplinary approach to somatic illnesses. It is a common knowledge that comorbid anxiety and depression disorders can influence the course of various somatic illnesses and worsen their prognosis. We also have evidence-based studies that depression for example is an independent risk factor of heart infarct onset. On the other hand, we observe the somatization of clinical picture of mental disorders, the increase of atypical forms manifesting through pain or other somatic syndromes that leads to the increase of mental illnesses in the primary care. The research of common pathways of mental and somatic pathology should be the subject of further interdisciplinary research programs. The other issue is the patient's compliance that plays in important role in the success of every kind of treatment. Personality traits and status of mental health can influence ones attitude to illness as well as motivation to therapy. We cannot assess the population state of health without taking into consideration the evaluation of mental status as well as such definitions like subjective well being, life quality and stigmatization.

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

It is a challenge for psychiatrists and other physicians to accurately diagnose and treat the patient. There are patients who insist that they have a medical problem and whose claim is not confirmed by physical examination or laboratory testing. The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses.

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

If an occupational health physician is aware of them, it is much easier for him to organize activities with the aim to prevent stress in the work environment. The determination of physiological reactions to chronic stressors may be useful in assessing stressogenic traits of various jobs, understanding morbid effect of stress and recognising persons oversensitive to occupational stress. Physiological examinations of traumatic stress render it possible to identify the mechanism responsible for the development of disorders resulting from traumatic stress, provide indicators for an objective diagnosis of this disorders and help to distinguish and assess their long-term effects which may persist after a subsidence of acute symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric complication associated with pregnancy and childbirth with debilitating symptoms that negatively impact the quality of life of the mother as well as inflict potentially long-lasting developmental impairments to the child. Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.",

The event is then persistently re-experienced. The person avoids stimuli associated with the trauma and experiences a numbing of general responsiveness. Symptoms of increased arousal can occur as well as depression and anxiety. PTSD causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat. Repeated brief consultations over time can facilitate this process.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

      "abstract": "The physical symptoms attending the general paralysis of the insane have been shown to present in their progress three well-defined stages. Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of stress is complicated and it contains many different definitions.The first studies on stress have been based on physiology, but in the middle of the last century many psychological models emerged.Stress reaction can occur not only as a response to a real psychological and physical events, but also in their expectation.This type of stress is called the \"psychological\" and it is considered as the most important in today's society as the main cause of chronic stress.Professional, work or stress related to the profession, has a relatively short history in the scientific discussion.Certain theories emphasize people and the environment interact.In recent years, the pressure on physicians has increased in many countries, as a result of various health care reform affecting the autonomy of doctors, prestige and income, leading to more stress at work.Work stress can lead to chronic reactions, such as poor health, burnout and depression.The objective of this study was to investigate and determine the level of job stress for emergency medicine physicians and psychiatrists, as well as factors affecting its emergence, development and manifestation (in the actual medical literature called \"burnout syndrome\", i.e. \"burnout\").The study was designed as a cross sectional study.Respondents were emergency medicine physicians and psychiatrists (the average number of working hours at all was more than 35 per week), and 330 questionnaires were distributed.The total number of completed tests was 302 (152 emergency medicine physicians and 150 psychiatrists), which gives a very high response rate of 91.8%.The research was conducted through a questionnaire, which consisted of six segments, namely: socio-demographic questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire -GHQ, Maslach Burnout Inventory -MBI, Quality of Life -QOL, Questionnaire of employee satisfaction (UZZ) and emotions profile index -PIE.The level of burnout (MBI) was higher in all three domains, than in similar studies in the world literature, as well as level of psychological distress (GHQ), and the same scores were also higher than those in well-known, so far published and / or implemented in the papers in our country.Quality of life (QOL), and job satisfaction of employees (UZZ) in this sample, were significantly correlated with the above findings, i.e. burnout and psychological distress.The findings of certain characteristics of the emotional profile of the respondents (PIE), was also complement, and it showed the influence and importance of internal factors on the overall perception of job stress.Marriage, age, gender and habits, as sociodemographic characteristics, were statistically significantly associated with these factors.The general conclusion is that the level of job stress in emergency physicians and psychiatrists in this study was high, and as the factors that influence and contribute to the origin, maintenance and consequences, level of burnout, psychological distress, quality of life, job satisfaction among employees, emotional profile and sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents were proven.The presented results could contribute in the formulation of an additional guidance for the research and struggle against job stress, and all in order to protect the mental health of doctors who are entrepreneurs in a highly specific and human profession, and to achieve a greater productivity and to provide higher quality of healthcare services for patients.",

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

It is experienced as thoughts and feelings as well as in the body. Another way to define stress could be as an internal and conditioned response to external pressures. Mental health professionals often help people reduce and manage their stress. They can also help people work through other mental health issues that have developed while coping with high levels of stress over a period of time. The American Institute of Stress calls stress “America’s leading health problem.” In many cases, the stress Americans experience today is a response to psychological threats. Some of these threats might be losing a job or looking for employment, the death of a loved one, or relationship issues. Any of these can occur more than once in the course of a life",

      "title": "Xerostomia and Hyposalivation in Patients with Physical and Psychological Disabilities",
      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood,accompanied by low self-esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa. The impact of early childhood events in particular may have the long-lasting effects,especially if epigenetic changes are involved.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

      "title": "Duloxetine in the Treatment of Depression: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disorder that can be classified in the categories of non-organic psychiatric disorders and mood disorders. Mood tone is an important psychic function involved in the adaptation to both our internal and external world. It is flexible, that is, it goes up when we are in positive and favorable conditions, but it goes down when we are in negative and unpleasant states. We can define depression as a condition when mood tone loses its flexibility, it goes down and its no longer influenced by favorable external events. In fact, depression is characterized by changes in the way how the affected individual thinks, feels and acts. Even if this change occurs gradually, a depressed subject is not the same as before. For example, a brilliant student could be persuaded to be not able to finish his studies; an affectionate mother could start to neglect her sons; an enterprising worker could lose every interest for his activity. Moreover, a depressed person doesnt care of his aspect or of himself. The surviving instinct could leave place to the desire to stop his own life. The most evident characteristic of depression in the adulthood is a sad mood, a gloomy solitary and apathetic attitude. A depressed subject could cry also with no apparent reason, he could have difficulty falling asleep or he could wake up very early in the morning and no longer returns to sleep. Or, instead, he could sleep more than usually and he could feel tired persistently. He could lose appetite and weight, or, in some cases, he could eat much more than usually and he could gain weight. Typically, a depressed person feels himself in a extremely negative way, he could think to be hopeless and helpless and he often condemns himself for small guilty. A depressed subject is pessimistic about himself and his own future; he loses interest in all what happens around him and he gets no satisfaction from the activities that before were pleasant. Some persons can be depressed also if they dont show evident signs of depression, but they complain for physical symptoms or they abuse of alcohol or other substances. It has been estimated that in the industrialized Western world one to six persons has a depressive episode at least once during his life; at present, the incidence of depression in the general population is around 5% with clear cut prevalence in the female sex. This leads to high social costs: behind the short-term inability, we have to consider also the long term inability (it has been estimated that, in 2020, depression will represent the second most frequent cause of permanent inability) as well as the suicide risk, the proved major susceptibility of depressed subjects to various non-psychiatric pathologies and the increased rate of premature deaths of depressed individuals as compared to the general population. The present work not only evaluates the drugs used for the treatment of depression, but it focuses also on those studies that investigated the efficacy of a second generation drug: Duloxetine that has a higher selectivity of action and a better tolerability profile as compared to first generation medications. These characteristics make Duloxetine the most effective therapeutic choice to improve both psychological and somatic symptoms of depression in order to get higher rates of symptomatic remission on depressive episodes.

Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie. De nombreux facteurs peuvent influencer la remission fonctionnelle d'un episode depressif majeur en remission clinique partielle comme les symptomes cliniques residuels de la depression (symptomatologie anxieuse, troubles du sommeil...), les comorbidites (psychiatriques / somatiques eventuelles), la prise d'un traitement antidepresseur, les evenements professionnels, les troubles cognitifs residuels de la depression (deficit des fonctions executives, deficits attentionnels, ralentissement psychomoteur).

Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity.

Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

Here, stress means the factor or event or cause through which there is mental disequilibrium, tension and maladaptive behaviour in the individual. Reber (1995) ahs rightly defined stress as “Stress, generally is any force that when’ applied to a system causes some significant connotation that the modification of its forms, usually with the connotation that the modification is a deformation or a distortion.

Today, this division is becoming obsolete and is harmful. Obsolete, because we are discovering changes in the tissues or in biochemical and immunological functions of the body in people with mental disorders, and because psychological complaints are frequent in all physical illnesses. Harmful, because the labels \"psychological\", \"psychogenic\", or \"somatoform\" are so loaded with connotations of being simulations or complaints about nothing that patients are unlikely to recive the help they need.",

Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related derivative medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence.

      "title": "The etiology of sudden death",
      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Depression in the elderly in the community: Effect of physical illness and selected social factors",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a major problem in medical patients. It is a problem that has been generally under-recognized and under-treated, highly associated with somatized symptoms, loss of function, and increased medical utilization. Obviously more training needs to be provided in this area for non-psychiatric physicians, as well as other primary care providers. Much of what guides recognition and treatment of depression in medical patients has been derived from studies of depression in non-medical populations. However, it is not completely clear that depression in medical populations is the same problem as that seen in the mental health care setting. Furthermore, the majority of psychopharmacology studies have been done in patients with no medical conditions. There are, fortunately, increasing numbers of drug and ECT studies in specific medical populations as well as outcome studies in medically ill depressed patients. There has been increasing recognition that in the primary care setting, less severe depressive symptom constellations are a common problem. This so-called \"sub-syndromal\" depression is an area of great interest but little understanding. There is no well researched information on such depressions in terms of natural course, response to treatment, or relation to other disorders such as anxiety disorders. It is hoped that non-psychiatric physicians will increasingly recognize depression in their patients and feel comfortable in its evaluation and initial management. Clinical practice guidelines, which may be helpful to primary care physicians, are currently being developed. When patients seem difficult to manage or diagnose, consultation should be sought from psychiatrists familiar with the special presentations and problems of working with this population.",

      "abstract": "When stress overwhelms the body or persists for a long time (chronic stress), the body is affected by it in a number of ways. Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

      "title": "The influence of chronic stress on health and coping mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Stress represents a negative life experience, closely followed by physiological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes that focus on changing the event or adapting to its effects. Any situation or occurrence that requires adaptation can be experienced as a stress, even positive situations and circumstances may be stressful, whether they come from the outside world, or the sources of stress is internal. While acute stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, if it lasts for a long time, or is frequently repeated, it becomes chronic, and can cause various serious disorders. During chronic stress, there is an exhaustion of the body's capacity for an adequate reaction, which can lead to long-lasting immunological dysfunction, which significantly impairs health and quality of life. According to the WHO (2017), stress is one of the causes of even 60% known diseases, and in a number of mental disorders a direct connection with stress has been reported: in acute stress reactions, \"posttraumatic stress disorder\", adjustment disorders and other reactions to severe stress. In addition, in all categories of mental disorders (ICD-10), the stressful situation or event plays a significant role in occurrence of the symptoms. A particular category of stress-related disorders are psychosomatic disorders. These are functional disorders in which there is no pathoanatomic substrate. In contrast to these, psychosomatic diseases are the type of illness in which there are structural changes of tissues and organs, the etiology of which is based on chronic stress, in addition to a number of other factors (Adamović, 1983) and which occur when there is a biological predisposition. The paper presents the mechanism of development of these diseases and some of the ways of coping with stress. According to the DSM-V, psychosomatic diseases are divided into skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, heart and blood vessel diseases, disorders of endocrine glands, rheumatoid diseases, gynecological diseases and others. In order to overcome stress and preserve health, psychological strategies for coping with stress play an important role. Multiple strategies are used, which include various stress control techniques: relaxation techniques, meditation methods, and assertive training, biofeedback and stress inoculation techniques. Successful mastering of coping stressful situations, constructive problem solving in life crisis, relaxation techniques and contributions to better adaptation to unexpected changes in life are of key importance for both mental and physical health.",

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

      "abstract": "Depression is perhaps the most frequent emotional disorder to occur after a stroke. These depressions may be either major or minor in type and usually remit within the first year after the stroke. In addition to emotional suffering, poststroke depression has been associated with inhibited physical recovery, impaired cognitive functioning, and increased mortality. Determining whether these consequences of stroke may be improved by treatment of depression constitutes both a major challenge and an enormous opportunity for new approaches to poststroke pharmacotherapy. Previous controlled and uncontrolled treatment trials have provided partial support for the hypothesis that mood, cognitive, physical, and survival consequences of poststroke depression may be improved by antidepressant therapy.",

      "abstract": "Central poststroke pain (CPSP), formerly known as thalamic pain syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy, is a central neuropathic pain occurring in patients affected by stroke. It is one manifestation of central pain, which is broadly defined as central neuropathic pain caused by lesions or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Thalamic pain was first described 100 years ago by Déjerine and Roussy and has been described as \"among the most spectacular, distressing, and intractable of pain syndromes\". CPSP is characterized by constant or intermittent pain and is associated with sensory abnormalities, particularly of thermal sensation. While the pain is frequently described as burning, scalding, or burning and freezing, other symptoms are usually vague and hard to characterize, making an early diagnosis particularly difficult. In fact, those who develop CPSP may no longer be under the care of health care professionals when their symptoms begin to manifest, resulting in misdiagnosis or a significant delay before treatment begins. Diagnosis is further complicated by cognitive and speech limitations that may occur following stroke, as well as by depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Patients may also exhibit spontaneous dysesthesia and the stimulus-evoked sensory disturbances of dysesthesia, allodynia and hyperalgesia. The present study offers a historical reference point for future clinical and basic research into this elusive type of debilitating pain.",

      "abstract": "Burnout has been viewed as a syndrome developing in response to chronically adverse working conditions. Burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Historically, however, burnout has been difficult to separate from depression. Indeed, the symptoms of burnout coincide with symptoms of depression. Evidence for the discriminant validity of burnout with regard to depression has been weak, both at an empirical and a theoretical level. Emotional exhaustion, the core of burnout, itself reflects a combination of depressed mood and fatigue/loss of energy and correlates very highly with other depressive symptoms. Work-related risk factors for burnout are also predictors of depression. Individual risk factors for depression (e.g., past depressive episodes) are also predictors of burnout. Overall, burnout is likely to reflect a \"classical\" depressive process unfolding in reaction to unresolvable stress.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). Numerous descriptions can be found in ancient literature of conditions that would be labeled mood disorders today. A major depressive episode (MDE) is the building block of the MDD diagnosis. MDEs are characterized most prominently by mood changes that are manifest as sad, depressed, empty mood, and/or significantly decreased interest or pleasure in all or nearly all usual activities. Depressed individuals frequently report cognitive changes that include impaired attention, concentration, and decision making. Theories regarding a genetic basis for some cases of depressive illness stem from findings of family and twin studies. Cognitive theories of mood disorders have primarily focused on the role that negative cognitions can play in creating a vulnerability to depression and maintaining a depressive state. Anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbid conditions among those with depressive disorders.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

It leads to great limitation in physical activity and has a negative impact on quality of life. It occurs regardless of the etiology of the heart failure, is usually insidious in onset, and is an important part of the classification of symptom severity. Despite these facts, it is a symptom that can be difficult to quantify and difficult to distinguish from dyspnea, the other hallmark symptom of heart failure. It is a subjective complaint that has no single objective test to measure it. In addition, it can be multifactorial in origin. It is not adequately explained by a reduced cardiac output alone, and other factors such as peripheral muscle and vasculature abnormalities, neuroendocrine changes, depression, side effects of therapy, sleep disturbances, and other concomitant diseases all need to be considered as etiologic factors.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

The diagnosis is purely clinical and based on the Budapest criteria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood and is thought to be multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been described: an inflammatory state, an overactivation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and a poor perception of pain at the central level. The management of signs and symptoms is therefore global. It involves physiotherapy and occupational therapy, often combined with analgesic medications. Psychological treatment may be proposed in certain circumstances.

Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy.

However, heterogeneity may be unavoidable because of the biopsychosocial complexity of depression. MDD may be characterised by complexities that cannot be distilled down to any brief set of diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists and psychiatric epidemiologists may need to revise their expectations of this diagnosis in order to avoid over-estimating its ability to guide the selection of treatments and prediction of prognosis. An opposing perspective is that of reification, in which the diagnosis is viewed as being more real than it really is. The concept of rheostasis may help to explain some features of this condition, such as why major depressive episodes sometimes seem understandable or even adaptive (e.g. in the context of bereavement) whereas at other times such episodes are inexplicable and maladaptive.",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A 29-year-old man had a chronic history of muscle fasciculations and painful muscle contractions triggered suddenly after extreme exertion. His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "title": "‘Causal relation between spasticity, strength, gross motor function, and functional outcome in children with cerebral palsy: a path analysis’",
      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

      "title": "Interim report: Development and evaluation of a three-week inpatient fatigue management education protocol for persons with MS-related fatigue",
      "abstract": "Background\r\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) reported by patients (between 50% and 92%; Krupp 2006, Weiland et al. 2015). The Multiple Sclerosis Council (1998) defines fatigue as “a subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities”. Fatigue limits the ability to participate in everyday activities, work, leisure and social participation and is considered to be one of the main causes of impaired quality of life among persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) independent from depression or disability (Jackson et al. 1991). \r\nPrimary fatigue refers to fatigue in absence of an apparent cause and it is specific of MS whereas secondary fatigue is a consequence of other concomitant conditions (e.g. psychological disturbances, musculoskeletal problems, sleep disorders and medication side effects), which may be related to MS but also to other diseases. The pathophysiology of primary fatigue in MS is highly complex and, so far, not completely understood. To date, the best therapeutic approach seems to be a multidisciplinary management involving exercise therapy, self-management and education in conjunction with medication (Rottoli et al., 2016, Kos et al., 2016). \r\nTwo meta-analyses provide moderate to strong evidence for fatigue management education (or energy management education) based on energy conservation strategies and cognitive behavioural therapy to reduce the impact of fatigue on occupational performance and quality of life (Asano et al., 2014, Blikman et al., 2013). The treatment protocols used in these clinical trials (Vanage et al. 2003, Sauter et al. 2008, Mathiowetz et al. 2005, Finlayson et al. 2011, Hugos et al. 2010, Kos et al. 2007) are all based on the 6-week group-based program developed by Packer et al. (1995), carried out in outpatient setting and delivered by trained occupational therapists. The typical features of this program are stable groups with 6-12 participants, hierarchical construction of the issues, 4-6 group sessions (±2h x week, total 12 hours) and homework between the group sessions to apply the energy conservation strategies and to implement a behavioural change. At the moment the evidence for in inpatient settings (Wendebourg et al. 2016, Van Kessel K. et al., 2008) or individual treatments (Kos et al., 2016) with the same issues are inconclusive due to the small sample size. \r\nDespite good evidence for fatigue management education programs, their limited external validity has prevented the implementation of these treatment protocols in Switzerland and other European countries. They are currently not available for pwMS in these countries. The main reasons are the absence of locally specialized OTs and no translated and culturally adapted treatment programs as well as a miss match between the organisational needs of the regional healthcare organizations and the treatment protocols. In Switzerland multidisciplinary rehabilitation for pwMS is delivered mostly in specialized rehabilitation centres, where pwMS spend three to four weeks as inpatients yearly or biennially. During the rest of the year, pwMS maintain their normal busy life which often includes (part-time) paid and/or family work. At best, they receive physiotherapy in the meantime, but they have no access to specialized OTs due to time, energy and availability constraints. \r\nUntil now, no program has focused on treating inpatients in dynamic group compositions over a shorter period (three weeks) but with higher frequency and has allowed participants to stream into the group continuously whenever being admitted which is necessary for successful implementation in the rehabilitation context. Information is missing whether such treatment characteristics are feasible in the inpatient setting and how these would be perceived by pwMS.\r\nProject aims \r\nThe project is divided into two distinct parts. \r\nThe aim of Part 1 was the development of an evidence based energy management education (EME) treatment protocol in German and a training concept in using EME for occupational therapists, followed by a test run with 10-15 pwMS and 3 OTs, evaluation of the experiences and optimization of the treatment protocol and the training protocol of OTs. Additionally, a feasibility study for the evaluation of the efficacy of EME was prepared.\r\nThe aim of Part 2 is to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for EME in terms of processes, procedures, resource management and scientific metrics by a pilot-run with 40 pwMS. \r\nAfter the validation of the treatment protocol low-threshold courses for occupational therapist will be provided to facilitate a broad implementation so as to assure the availability for many pwMS.\r\nProject partners and finances\r\nThis project is a cooperation of the Stiftung Kliniken Valens with the Rehabilitation Research Laboratory 2rLab of the University of Applied Sciences (SUPSI) in Manno. Part 1 was partly financed by the Swiss Occupational Therapy Association and the “Stiftung Ergotherapie Zurich”. Part 2 is partly financed by the Swiss MS-Association. The execution of this project is enabled by SUPSI and Kliniken Valens.",

The study involved an on-line survey, which included measures of depression not confounded by somatic symptoms, medication use, self-reported physical functioning, pain, and other demographic variables.

The symptoms are recognized for what they are and respond rapidly to reassurance, mild sedation, and effective treatment of the obvious disease or injury. On the other hand, many patients come with anxiety of more obscure cause. It may manifest itself as fatigue, nervousness, tenseness, headache, insomnia, indigestion, or a host of other symptoms.

Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "title": "Determining the cause of dyspnoea: linguistic and biological descriptors",
      "abstract": "Dyspnoea is the most common symptom of patients with cardio-respiratory diseases. It is a generic term related to different pathophysiological abnormalities that may result in different qualities of respiratory discomfort, defined by specific verbal descriptors for a specific diagnosis. Often it is difficult to distinguish the underlying pathology of dyspnoea, eg, either from chronic heart failure (CHF) or from other respiratory causes. The discovery of the endocrine function of the heart, as well as the development of accurate and feasible assay methods allow the use of cardiac natriuretic hormones in the assessment of cardiovascular diseases, namely acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. It is advisable to measure cardiac natriuretic hormones in order to exclude or suggest the diagnosis of CHF in patients with a suspicious diagnosis, but with ambiguous signs and symptoms or manifestations that can be confused with other pathologies (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The most common symptom of patients with cardio-respiratory diseases is dyspnoea, a 'difficult, laboured, uncomfortable breathing'. Dyspnoea has been defined as 'a term used to characterize a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. The experience derives from interactions among multiple physiological, psychological, social and environmental factors, and may induce secondary physiological and behavioural responses'. Breathlessness is characterized by measurable intensity and qualitative dimensions, which may vary depending on the individual, the underlying disease, and other circumstances.3 The neurophysiological basis of dyspnoea relies on receptors in the airways lung parenchyma, respiratory muscles together with chemoreceptors providing sensory feedback via vagal, phrenic and intercostal nerves to the spinal cord, medulla and higher centres. Breathlessness is based on different pathophysiolagical abnormalities that may result in different qualities of respiratory discomfort, which are defined by specific verbal descriptors related to a specific diagnosis. Nevertheless different diseases may share the same descriptors. There is no clear relationship between the qualitative descriptors of dyspnoea and the quantitative intensity among the patient groups: different diseases may be distinguished by quality but not intensity of the sensation. Differences in languages, in races, cultures, gender, and in the manner in which concepts or symptoms are held can all influence the idea, quality and intensity of dyspnoea.",

      "title": "Un diagnostic \"psy\" invisible : le cas du trouble d'adaptation",
      "abstract": "Le trouble d'adaptation (TA) est un diagnostic defini par le DSM comme une reaction psychologique a un evenement de vie penible. Sa prevalence clinique est relativement elevee en premiere ligne medicale ou il fait parfois figure de diagnostic officieux de « depression mineure » et d' « epuisement professionnel ». Bien que le TA soit un diagnostic frequemment utilise en clinique medicale, il demeure relativement peu etudie. A peine une centaine de publications scientifiques abordent le diagnostic dans des revues savantes depuis son introduction en 1980. Un tel chiffre contraste avec les milliers d'etudes menees sur les autres diagnostics psychiatriques dont la prevalence est comparable, notamment la depression majeure. Cette faible attention scientifique portee au TA interpelle plusieurs chercheurs. La principale hypothese retenue jusqu'a maintenant pour expliquer ce phenomene est le caractere non specifique de la definition du TA qui entrainerait des obstacles methodologiques significatifs. Cependant, plusieurs autres attributs du diagnostic paraissent susceptibles de limiter son etude, dont sa nature relativement benigne vis-a-vis des autres troubles psychiatriques. Afin d'eclaircir les raisons derriere la faible attention scientifique portee au TA, nous avons procede a une analyse de contenu thematique de la litterature scientifique abordant specifiquement le diagnostic. Nous avons ainsi recolte cent quinze textes publies dans des revues savantes depuis trente ans ayant l'expression « trouble d'adaptation » dans leur titre. Apres categorisation des textes scientifiques et identification des principales dimensions substantives associees au TA, nous avons pu degager les principaux attributs du diagnostic susceptibles de repondre a notre question de recherche. Cette etude, qui propose un regard sociologique inedit sur le diagnostic du TA, laisse voir que la faible attention scientifique dont il est l'objet est le produit de plusieurs facteurs. D'abord, bien que defini par la psychiatrie, l'objet d'etude que represente TA se derobe vraisemblablement de cette specialite medicale par son profil phenomenologique mineur, par l'absence de substrat biologique associe ainsi que par l'approche pharmacotherapeutique minimale qu'on preconise a l'egard du diagnostic. Ensuite, l'ambiguite fondamentale qui caracterise le TA, le savoir tacite du DSM que requiert son etude ainsi que le benefice que le diagnostic retire d'une forme d'invisibilite contribuent aussi a reduire l'extension de la recherche a son endroit. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : trouble d'adaptation, diagnostic, depression, clinique, psychiatrie",

States of agitation are mainly due to simple or pathological inebriety. Any case of acute alcoholic intoxication requires a full clinical examination and a simple laboratory work-up. Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.",

Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.",

Often discussed in the frame of psychiatry, it is also observed in other domains of medicine.

Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life. Finally, it keeps researchers away from certain domains of medicine and has a negative impact on funding for research and treatment. It is therefore important to understand its underlying mechanisms in order to fight it more efficiently.La stigmatisation est un phénomène social très commun, basé sur la discrimination d’un individu ou d’un sous-groupe d’individus par un groupe dominant ou majoritaire. Discuté habituellement dans le contexte spécifique de la psychiatrie, ce phénomène existe aussi dans d’autres domaines de la médecine. Il touche non seulement les patients mais également leurs proches, leurs enfants, et parfois les soignants qui s’en occupent. De plus, il nuit à l’implantation de stratégies de prévention, induit des réactions dépressives, une perte d’estime de soi et une détérioration de la qualité de vie chez les patients.

When found, the physician has an important role in explaining the nature of depression and its treatment to the patient. Treatment is with antidepressant drugs and/or psychological treatment.

Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

The search for an extended understanding of the causes of depression, and for the development of additional effective treatments is highly significant. Clinical and pre-clinical studies suggest stress is a key mediator in the pathophysiology of depression.",

      "abstract": "Results of the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) are frequently abnormal in depression but not always. We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

Many of these conditions are located to cervical or suboccipital muscles and constitute a separate group in the classification scheme for chronic pain published in Pain (Merskey, 1986). The pain appears to originate in muscles or connective tissue associated with muscle. The aetiology is not known, but parameters indicating a negative emotional state (depression, anxiety), stressful conditions at home or at work (time pressure, emotional conflicts, perceived poor psychosocial work environment) or mechanical stress (posture, repetitive work tasks) are often shown to correlate with the pain condition (Holm et al., 1986; Ellertsen & Kløve, 1987; Kamwendo, Linton & Moritz, 1991; Winkel & Westgaard, 1992).",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is the most feared of diseases.Unsurprisingly, it causes considerable psychological distress in patients, families, carers, and often those health professionals who care for them.Only a minority of cancer patients develop psychiatric illness, but other psychologically and socially determined problems are common.These include unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue; problems with finances, employment, housing, and childcare; family worries; and existential and spiritual doubts.Well planned care that fully involves patients and their families can minimise these problems. Psychological consequencesThough often dismissed as \"understandable,\" distress is a treatable cause of reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcome.Some patients delay seeking help because they fear or deny their symptoms of distress.Presentation can be obvious, as depressed or anxious mood can manifest as increased severity of somatic complaints such as breathlessness, pain, or fatigue.Adjustment disorder is the commonest psychiatric diagnosis, and neuropsychiatric complications may occur.The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of coping with cancer. DepressionDepression is a response to perceived loss.A diagnosis of cancer and awareness of associated losses may precipitate feelings similar to bereavement.The loss may be of parts of the body (such as a breast or hair), the role in family or society, or impending loss of life.Severe and persistent depressive disorder is up to four times more common in cancer patients than in the general population, occurring in 10-20% during the disease. Anxiety, fear, and panicAnxiety is the response to a perceived threat.It manifests as apprehension, uncontrollable worry, restlessness, panic attacks, and avoidance of people and of reminders of cancer, together with signs of autonomic arousal.Patients may overestimate the risks associated with treatment and the likelihood of a poor outcome.Anxiety may also exacerbate or heighten perceptions of physical symptoms (such as breathlessness in lung cancer), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (with intrusive thoughts and avoidance of reminders of cancer) occasionally follow diagnosis or treatment that has been particularly frightening.Certain cancers and treatments are associated with specific fears.Thus, patients with head and neck cancers may worry about being able to breathe and swallow.Patients may develop phobias and conditioned vomiting in relation to unpleasant treatments such as chemotherapy.",

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

      "title": "Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

It originates (with few exceptions) from stimulation of the so-called tissue nociceptors. Their stimulation results in depolarisation of C-fibers. The stimulus will be transferred to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and may then, depending on facilitating or inhibiting modulation, be conducted through the spinothalamic tract to the medulla oblongata (1,2). Here, in the hypothalamus and the thalamus, additional processing takes place before the information is translated into the sensation of \"pain.\" The subjective feeling of pain may be influenced by further factors such as distraction. In principle, the production of pain can be modulated, either amplified or reduced, at all of the aforementioned levels.",

No obstante, existen algunos vacíos de conocimiento en relación con esta problemática. Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial. Adicionalmente, vivir una experiencia de aprendizaje con este tipo de tensiones puede desencadenar dificultades para la concentración y la memoria, procesos que son fundamentales para el éxito académico.",

A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

Anxiety disorders are psychiatric disorders commonly encountered in the elderly and correlate with increased health burden, morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. The elderly with cardiovascular and multimorbid diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This disorder can be a continuation of previous occurrences or a first-time event. The interaction between neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors triggers the onset of this disorder. Diagnosis enforcement is often challenging due to comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression or cognitive disorders, as well as the similarity of anxiety symptoms to symptoms caused by other medical conditions or aging. The elderly find it difficult to accurately describe and identify anxiety. Expertise is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, this disorder often does not receive proper treatment, even though optimal management is crucial to improving outcomes and achieving optimal quality of life in the elderly. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches require special attention due to the impact of aging on organ function.

Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder, and the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders among youths with chronic medical illnesses is higher compared to their healthy counterparts. Anxiety disorders may develop secondary to predisposing biological mechanisms related to a child's specific medical illness, as a response to being ill or in the hospital, a threatening environment, as a result of other genetic and psychological factors, or as a combination of all these factors. Additionally, exposure to physical pain early in one's life and/or frequent painful medical procedures are correlated with fear and anxiety during subsequent procedures and treatments, and may lead to medical nonadherence and other comorbidities. Anxiety disorders can have serious consequences in children/adolescents with chronic and/or life-limiting medical illnesses. Therefore, proper identification and treatment of anxiety disorders is necessary and may improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also physical symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive methods as well as psychotropic medications are used to treat anxiety disorders in pediatric patients. We will review current treatments for anxiety in children/adolescents with medical illnesses and propose future research directions.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor.

Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mood disorder characterized by hopelessness then heartbreak, helplessness, excessive and unable to decide to start an activity, then unable to concentrate, not having the spirit of life, and in the final stage trying to commit suicide. Depressive symptoms are a collection of behaviors and feelings that can be specifically classified as depression. Symptoms of depression are at least seen from three aspects, namely physical symptoms, psychic symptoms, and social symptoms. Some people have a negative stigma about individuals affected by mental disorders such as depression, some studies show data on affected individuals exposed to negative stigma, one of which was shown by McLean Hospital in 2020 which showed that 75% of individuals with mental disorders had been stigmatized by society. The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders. The results showed that faith can be a factor that can improve the mental health of an individual.",

The relationship between depression and CFS is unclear and may be explained by one of four models: (1) CFS is an atypical manifestation of MDE; (2) depression is the result of CFS as either an organic mood syndrome or an adjustment reaction; (3) CFS and MDE are covariates; and (4) the diagnosis of MDE is artifactual. The evidence for these models is discussed. The potentially confounding effect of depression on tests of immune function and neuropsychological testing is described.

Diagnosis is made basically on somatic symptoms, the most important ones being chronic fatigue, chronic pain, chronic sleep disorder, chronic gastrointestinal disturbance, and dysphoria. Other illnesses that might be present instead of or in addition to depression should be sought, both before depression therapy is started and also in the face of persistent symptoms after treatment is started. Basic treatment is with antidepressant medications, with careful attention to selection of drug and dosage, and careful monitoring for adverse effects. Antidepressant therapy and any other applicable forms of therapy are not mutually exclusive, and any other means of improving the patient's overall situation should be vigorously sought.",

Muskelschmerzen (Myalgien) treten in verschiedenen Schweregraden bei bis zu 75 % aller ME/CFS-Patienten auf. Das zentrale Symptom dieser Patienten ist die durch körperliche Anstrengung hervorgerufenen Erschöpfung. Ursprünglich wurde die Erkrankung als Myalgische Enzephalomyelitis beschrieben, als 1955 in Großbritannien plötzlich eine ganze Gruppe von Patienten mit einer mysteriösen ansteckenden Erkrankung entdeckt wurde. Es gibt jedoch keine wissenschaftlichen Beweise für eine Entzündung im Gehirn, daher wird heute die Bezeichnung Chronic Fatigue Syndrom bevorzugt. Fatigue bezeichnet ein Gefühl von körperlicher und geistiger Müdigkeit, das mit reduzierten Energiereserven und Muskelkraft einhergeht. Unter physiologischen Bedingungen wird diese Erschöpfung nach extremer körperlicher oder geistiger Anstrengung als normal und angenehm empfunden. Als Krankheitssymptom tritt sie ohne vorherige Anstrengung auf, und verschwindet auch nach ausreichender Erholungszeit nicht. Fatigue interferiert mit wichtigen Aspekten des täglichen Lebens und kann somit die Lebensqualität der Betroffenen sehr ungünstig beeinflussen (siehe auch Ulrich Rüffer in psychoneuro 2004; 30: 218-220).",

The adoption of a lumping strategy for mood disorders, particularly for classifying depressive disorders, reflects the perspective of depression as a unitary construct that represents a final common pathway derived from a variety of etiological and pathophysiological sources, which accounts for the shared clinical features seen in the heterogeneous groups of depressive disorders. A diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) is made by recognizing the characteristic syndrome of symptoms that cluster together during the same period of time. The hallmark of manic and hypomanic episodes is a discrete period of abnormally elevated, euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood that persists for at least a week in the case of mania or at least 4 days in the case of hypomania. Major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes.",

      "abstract": "Stressful or traumatic life events can lead to emergence of mood episodes. Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir. Göç, taşınma, yer değiştirme, işini kaybetme, iflas, ekonomik kayıp, boşanma, doğal afetler, kaza sonucu yaralanma ya da yakınını kaybetme gibi olaylar bipolar bozukluğun ilk hastalık dönemini tetikleyebilir. Bu tür yaşam olaylarından sonra genellikle depresif dönem belirtileri ortaya çıkar. Cenaze manisi ise, yakın bir aile üyesinin ölümünü takiben kişide mani dönemi belirtilerinin ortaya çıkması olarak tanımlanmıştır. Sevilen kişinin kaybından çok kısa bir süre sonra ortaya çıkan cenaze manisi ile ilgili bilgiler kısıtlıdır. Konu ile ilgili az sayıda olgu bildirimi mevcuttur. Bu çalışmada babasının ölümü sonrası ilk kez mani dönemi belirtileri ile başvuran, öncesinde herhangi bir psikiyatrik hastalık ve tedavi görme öyküsü olmayan 26 yaşındaki kadın hasta literatür bulguları eşliğinde sunulmuştur. DSM-5 tanı ölçütlerine göre bipolar bozukluk (mani dönemi) tanısı ile izlenen hastanın duygudurum dönemi belirtileri ile babasının ölümü arasındaki zamansal yakınlık olması ve önceki örseleyici yaşam olaylarına bu şekilde bir tepki geliştirmemiş olması dikkat çekicidir. Bu nedenle olgunun tanısı cenaze manisi olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Olası yas tepkileri arasında nadir de olsa mani dönemi belirtilerinin görülebileceği unutulmamalıdır.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Empirical studies have recently demonstrated that major and minor depressive disorders occur in 30–50% of stroke patients, and last more than one year without treatment, although they do respond to tricyclic antidepressants. These mood disorders are not strongly associated with severity of impairment, demographic characteristics, social supports or prior personal history, but major depression is often strongly associated with left frontal or left basal ganglia lesions and pre-existing subcortical atrophy. While the aetiology of these mood disorders remains unknown, serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction may play a role. Mania is a rare complication of stroke: the clinical presentation and response to treatment are usually the same as mania without brain injury. Post-stroke mania is strongly associated with both a right hemisphere lesion in a limbic-connected area and a second predisposing factor, such as genetic loading for affective disorder, pre-existing subcortical atrophy or seizure disorder. This disorder may be mediated through frontal lobe dysfunction. The lesion method represents a potentially fruitful technique for investigating the mechanisms of affective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

In addition, challenges attend making decisions about an individual's ability to function based solely on the medical diagnosis, particularly when impairment is subtle or subjective. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a model for understanding the limits of the medical approach to determining impairment and disability. A protocol from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is used to define CFS. This protocol is not a list of diagnostic criteria, and some patients with chronic fatigue may not meet the CDC definition. The syndrome reflects dysfunction in the neuroendocrine system similar in some ways to that seen with depressive illness, and most patients seen for this condition fulfill the criteria for depression, which is another illness characterized by fatigue and somatic complaints. Physicians who evaluate and treat patients with subtle persistent illness know that employers and coworkers respond less positively to an employee's needs when illness is subtle than when impairment is obvious. Physicians must be clear about the family, job, and employment risks patients take when they stay out of work for medical reasons; they also must recognize the risk these patients take when they continue to work despite impaired performance.",

When pain occurs in spinal lesions most cases show the classical features of central pain: the pain takes time to develop, there is no tissue damage outside the CNS, there is associated sensory deficit, there is the presence of allodynia and there are lower skin temperatures in the painful area, with the frequent exacerbation of pain by temperature changes or emotional stress, and resistance to narcotic analgesia.

      "abstract": "The primary purpose of any treatment, whether psychological or pharmacological, should always be the curing of a disorder, or at least an improving of the symptoms. Thus, we should be very critical of those treatments that offer only improvements of secondary aspects, like quality of life, or unspecific results, like the patient's subjective evaluation of the treatment in question. The latter is especially common for psychological treatments. Thus, it can be said that most psychological treatments might be useless because, perhaps due to lack of tradition, there is a limited number of psychological treatments that are properly validated by controlled clinical trial that includes a large enough sample, a prospective design, an adequate control group, randomized assignment of groups, blind evaluation of results and a medium- to long-term follow-up of patients. To make matters worse, some studies that have a good part, if not all, of these features use very indirect measurements of effectiveness that do not make it possible to show that a specific psychological treatment significantly reduces one type of symptoms, the number of hospitalizations, etc. And in reality, strictly speaking that is really the only thing that should be important to us, at least in principle, as therapists. This does not mean that an improvement in certain non-nuclear aspects of the disorder is not important: it is, but at a level immediately below symptomatic improvement, and therefore two levels below the primary objective (“curing” the disorder, somewhat utopian for more than 90% of psychiatric disorders).",

Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.",

In clinical practice this combination of depression and anxiety is challenging as high levels of anxiety in depression are associated with more impairment and a worse prognosis. Anxiety in late-life depression has many faces. It can represent itself in a physical or mental form, like tension or worry. With all its complications it can also be categorized as a separate anxiety disorder, like a panic disorder or a generalized anxiety disorder. Many former studies that examined this so-called ‘anxious depression’ did not differentiate between depression with high levels of anxiety and a depression with a concurrent anxiety disorder.Our general message stresses the importance to differentiate between these depressive states. Different characteristics are found, like certain personality traits or the impact of life-events. These characteristics differentiate even further when we look at separate concurrent anxiety disorders. The combination of anxiety and depression shows a less favorable course and has a negative impact on complete remission over a period of two years. In one of the studies, we investigated the feasibility of a method of intensive repeated measurements. The patient reported about her depressive and anxiety symptoms five times a day during her daily activities. This provided a detailed insight in her symptom dynamics and stimulated a dialogue on possible treatment targets and interventions.",

      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

Clinical correlates of post-stroke depression include severity of physical and cognitive impairment as well as location of brain injury. Perhaps the most compelling reason to identify post-stroke depression, however, is its substantial impact on recovery in activities of daily living, cognitive function, and survival. Antidepressant medication has been shown to effectively treat depression, although its administration may require careful clinical monitoring. Other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders include mania, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, apathy, and pathological crying. Controlled studies have not documented the effect of these disorders on long-term recovery, but the potential impact of syndromes such as mania and apathy on rehabilitation efforts or pathological crying on social functioning are evident. With the exception of pathological crying, which has been shown to respond to antidepressant drug therapy, the other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders need to be evaluated in controlled treatment trials for response to therapy.",

Meta-analysis was performed when two or more studies of the same substance could be analyzed in a subpopulation of participants (i.e., with the same illness).\r\nRelevance to Nursing\r\nFatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in individuals who have cancer and also is highly prevalent in populations with progressive life-threatening conditions. Fatigue presents a challenge for healthcare professionals because it can be nonspecific to treatment or illness, ongoing, subjective, and disabling to patients. In addition, the actual causes of fatigue are difficult to isolate, particularly in the person who is receiving palliative care because the symptom usually overlaps with concurrent disease-related problems such as malnutrition, sleep disturbances, pain, depression, asthenia, infections, and anemia. No consensus exists on the definition of fatigue or a standardized method of assessment. The working diagnosis used for the purpose of this review was “fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy” (Radbruch et al., 2008, p. 15).\r\nIn the context of palliative and advanced disease, fatigue can be viewed as an inevitable characteristic of the last phase of life. However, several pharmacologic treatments have been studied in an attempt to reduce the severity of the symptom and thereby improve the overall quality of life. Knowledge of effective medical treatments will be of particular interest to nurses who care for patients who frequently experience debilitating fatigue.",

Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder.

The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

      "abstract": "Pain presents an ethical problem in psychotherapy which it shares with other symptoms. It presents this problem because initially it does not give rise to the same expectations as overt psychological complaints such as depression or anxiety. At first glance pain appears to represent an obvious example of the traditional doctor/patient relationship...I hope to demonstrate that what began as a transaction in the medicine of organic disease, may become, before the patient recognizes it, a process of personal change of which the consequences may often not be foreseen. Such a development poses a problem in bioethics. If the development can be foreseen, the problem may be forestalled. If not, the proceedings may reflect paternalism and we need to consider if that is acceptable. The problem is not unique to pain but tends to be masked by the initial context of somatic treatment.",

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

      "abstract": "Children and adolescents may express psychiatric symptoms via somatic complaints. Likewise, children with chronic somatic illnesses are likely to experience psychiatric sequelae. We report three cases of adolescents who were admitted to general paediatrics services for abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting with a negative medical workup. In each case, a clear psychosocial stressor was evident. It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter. More research is needed to determine appropriate screening tools for identifying cases where psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in symptom presentation, as well as potential treatment modalities for such cases.",

      "title": "Stress and insomnia – A vicious circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterised by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school and social settings. The common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, general discomfort and cognitive difficulties. On the other hand, stress results from emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can make a person feel frustrated, angry or anxious. Stress is the body’s response to a challenge or demand, accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stress depends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual’s characteristics, their neuroendocrine system and the combination of these elements, collectively determining how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, improving sleep hygiene and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than address its underlying cause. In the context of homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual’s unique structure, composition, nature and physical makeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualise each case and administer a simillimum remedy, the remedy most likely to restore health, and achieve complete healing according to homoeopathic principles. This review explores the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur due to the interplay between stress and the development of insomnia.",

Pharmaceutical reductionism leads to overtreatment or mistreatment, and does not offer solutions to the complexity of clinical situations, such as the problems related to discontinuation of antidepressant medications. A different psychiatric approach is outlined. Psychiatrists have the potential to move from their traditionally assigned position as marginal components of the medical profession to leaders in multidisciplinary medicine, favoring the role of clinical judgment.

      "abstract": "Pain is an ubiquitous human experience. It is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for approximately one quarter of general practice consultations and half of all outpatient attendances and hospital admissions in the UK (Royal College of Physicians, 1996). For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors.

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

Namun, dalam proses pembelajarannya, seorang mahasiswa kedokteran harus menghadapi berbagai tuntutan akademik yang berat dan dapat menyebabkan kesehatan mentalnya terganggu. Gangguan kesehatan mental merupakan kondisi seseorang mengalami gangguan psikologis sehingga menyebabkan perubahan negatif pada kesejahteraan hidup, fisiologis kejiwaan, dan kecakapan hidup. Beberapa contoh gangguan ini adalah perasaan stres, cemas, dan depresi. Stres merupakan reaksi tertekan pada tubuh terhadap besarnya tuntutan dan kewajiban yang harus dilakukan dalam waktu tertentu. Cemas adalah kondisi seseorang yang merasa gelisah, takut, dan khawatir yang terlalu berlebihan terhadap masa depan. Depresi merupakan kondisi berkurangnya energi tubuh, berkurangnya minat dalam menjalankan aktivitas sehari-hari, serta perasaan sedih yang berkepanjangan. Segala stresor yang menyebabkan gangguan kesehatan mental ini tidak hanya didapatkan dari proses pembelajaran, namun juga didapatkan dari kondisi eksternal, seperti tekanan dari teman sejawat, finansial, dan keluarga. Gangguan kesehatan mental mampu memberikan pengaruh besar bagi mahasiswa kedokteran dalam melaksanakan aktivitas perkuliahannya, salah satunya adalah pengaruhnya terhadap hasil Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter (UKMPPD). UKMPPD merupakan exit exam nasional bagi mahasiswa program profesi dokter yang harus diambil sebelum mengangkat sumpah dokter, ujian ini terdiri atas Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) dan Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Kondisi mental yang tidak sehat berpengaruh pada kinerja mahasiswa dalam menganalisis setiap materi yang akan dipelajari. Besarnya beban mental yang ditampung mahasiswa akan membuat diri mereka tidak fokus untuk mempelajari materi secara terstruktur sehingga tidak semua materi dapat dipelajari dengan baik. Hal ini bermuara pada hasil UKMPPD yang tidak optimal.",

Despite this the development of quality of life research has been rather slow in the field but it is evident both from epidemiological and clinical studies that persons with major depression have a substantially lower subjective quality of life than healthy subjects, and that quality of life is severely affected in a number of life domains as well as associated with a worse functioning in various external life conditions. Subjective quality of life has also mostly been found to be worse than in other psychiatric conditions and equal to or worse than quality of life in several major medical chronic illnesses. Although investigations of quality of life in anxiety disorder are growing they are less frequent than in depression and still in its infancy. This is most evident concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and further studies in all anxiety disorders are strongly needed. The general picture emerging from studies performed is that anxiety disorders are illnesses that impair quality of life and social functioning in a number of life domains. There is some evidence that quality of life is most compromised in panic disorder (PD) and PTSD.",

The functions and implications of pain are clearest in situations of acute illness or injury or in chronic, organically based conditions in which actual or threatened tissue damage is signaled by its report. Much greater complexity is found in a variety of clinical presentations (conversion hysteria, hypochondriasis, chronic pain syndromes, Briquet's syndrome, Munchausen's syndrome) in which pain may form part or all of the clinical picture. In such conditions the relationship of the patient's report of pain to other phenomena (tissue damage, physiopathology, perceptual and cognitive styles, personality type, individual and family psychodynamics, anxiety, depression, behavioral patterns, social and economic factors, cultural influences) is important in elucidating pathogenetic mechanisms of which several may be operating in any one case.

So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.).

Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]. Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death. adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well. The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral). General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer.. Psychosocial Treatment Laboratory, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo alto, Ca1991Google Scholar, 18.Kissane D.W. Love A. Hatton A. et al.The effect of cognitive-existential group psychotherapy on survival in early stage breast cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4255-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19.Fawzy F.I. Fawzy N. Hyun C.S. et al.Malignant melanoma: effects of an early structured psychiatric intervention, coping and affective state on recurrence and survival 6 years later.arch General Psychiatr. 1993; 50: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar]. Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

It was found that the closest relationship between the level of post-traumatic stress and psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, etc.) is observed in the case of delayed experience of a dangerous disease, which allows us to consider it as a special existential situation.",

      "abstract": "Depression and Anxiety Disorder in Children and AdolescentsDepression and anxiety are common in children and indicate a problem with mood or anxiety processing.Everyone has moods and fears.Some people have intense moods or feelings that interfere with their lives in their family, with peers, at school, and in play.Importantly, both depression and anxiety disorders can be treated.Depression is mostly a problem of moods.Sadness or irritability are the core symptoms, and thinking, sleeping, eating, and energy are also affected.Anxiety disorders are difficulties with worries or fears that make it hard for a child to participate in their day-to-day life.Extreme fears can focus on specific types of situations, such as social situations or being away from parents, or can be generalized about almost anything.Anxiety can also include panic attacks with rapid heartbeat or trouble breathing.Depression and anxiety can cause difficulties with sleeping, thinking, or managing frustration.It is common for anxiety or depression to first be noticed with disruptive behaviors such as trouble with rules, talking back, or tantrums.Depression and anxiety disorders can develop in children at any age, from preschool through adolescence.A combination of life experiences, inherited genes, and other factors influence who develops anxiety or depression and when.While depression and anxiety are more likely to develop in stressful situations or run in families, both can develop any time and in anyone.During the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of anxiety and depression have doubled, with depression rising to 1 in 4 children and youth and problematic anxiety to 1 in 5. Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

      "abstract": "In spite of its nature as an often severe and disabeling disease, it is still unclear, whether the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is an entire disease of its own right or not. Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

Elles correspondent souvent a la survenue d'evenements nouveaux, vecus comme traumatisants. Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre.

      "abstract": "Evidence for a connection between stress and selected cardiovascular diseases is analyzed. Does stress cause or exacerbate cardiovascular diseases?The stress phenomenon is illustrated and the impact of stress on the circulatory system is examined. In particular, the pathophysiological significance of stress in hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (and others) is described.Stress plays a major role in various (patho)physiological processes associated with the circulatory system. Thereby, it potentially has ameliorating or detrimental capacities. However, with regard to cardiovascular diseases, stress most often is related to deleterious results. The specific outcome depends on multiple variables (amount of stress, duration of its influence, patient's history/predisposition, genetic components -- as they all may alter functions of the basic stress response components: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal medullary system).Stress has a major impact upon the circulatory system. It plays a significant role in susceptibility, progress, and outcome of cardiovascular diseases. Subjective or individual differences have also to be taken into account. Stress, especially 'adequate' acute stress - stress that is not 'overwhelming' - may improve performance and thus be beneficial in certain cases. The close relationship between stress and cardiovascular diseases may represent an important aspect of modern medicine. New therapeutic strategies have to be set in place.",

      "title": "3001 – Are mental illnesses disorders of the brain?",
      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

      "title": "Somatization",
      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully.

Center of Diagnosis has developed diagnostic criteria as based upon symptoms & exclusion of other illness. Treatment of CFS is sympom based and include pharmacological, cognitive and behavioral therapy, with lifestyle exercise and lifestyle management therefore the assesment and treatment of CFS should be multidirectional and taliored to the need of patients.",

      "title": "Insomnia associated with medical disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

      "abstract": "Major depression is a widespread, often chronic disorder affecting the individual, his or her family, and society as a whole. It incurs tremendous social and financial costs in the form of impaired relationships, lost productivity, and lost wages. Although chronic major depression is eminently treatable, it continues to be undertreated and underrecognized. This is particularly true in primary care settings, where physicians are usually the first to encounter chronic depression but are seldom trained to distinguish depression from other medical illnesses with similar symptoms. In addition, because of the stigma attached to depression, patients often characterize their symptoms as part of a physical illness or fail to report them to a clinician at all. This article discusses the epidemiology of depression, its impact and burden on society, and its special character (including diagnosis and treatment) as a chronic illness.",

      "title": "Late-life depression",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression is highly heterogeneous in clinical presentation, and is also commonly resistant to treatment. While some cases are a continuation of the chronic course of illness beginning in early adulthood, a large number of persons will have a first episode of depression in later life following alife-time of relatively good mental health. While incident cases of major depression tend to decrease with age, the number of persons with clinically significant depressive symptomatology rises. À distinction has often been made between early-onset and late-onset depression, however, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest these are distinct clinical entities. On the other hand observations from a fifteen year prospective population study of psychiatric disorder in the elderly (the ESPRIT Study) supports the alternative idea that depression may be divided into sub-types according to postulated aetiology; for example depression with a strong genetic component, related to hormonal changes, the consequence of trauma; the result of cerebrovascular insult. Exposure to these putative causes may be more common at different points in the life span, thus suggesting age-differences. Our research further suggests that even cases of depression appearing for the first time in late-life, may be initially triggered by risk factors occurring decades before. Our findings suggest, for example, that childhood events may lead to changes in the biology of stress management, which continue throughout life, increasing vulnerability to depression and persisting even after effective treatment of symptoms. Together these observations suggest it may be more meaningful to classify depression in the elderly according to probable principle precipitating factors rather than age.",

      "title": "Die Depression in der Postpartalzeit: eine diagnostische und therapeutische Herausforderung",
      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

Accurate recognition and diagnosis is very dependent on the skills of the clinician. This chapter focuses on the assessment of a patient with depression, but highlights the differences between this presentation and that of a patient with an anxiety disorder. A patient attending with physical symptoms may have a comorbid psychiatric illness or somatic symptoms of an underlying depression, which are perceived as a physical illness. Anxiety is an emotion experienced as a normal phenomenon in response to threat or uncertainty. Anxiety disorders occur when anxiety is out of proportion to the threat posed and also impacts on the patient's functioning. Anxiety and depression are recognised as discrete primary disorders. However, there is often some overlap between the two: most depressed patients also have some symptoms of anxiety, and many of those with more severe anxiety disorders will also have some feelings of depression.",

Individual anxiety disorders have considerable symptomatic overlap in their expression. The life-time prevalence of all anxiety disorders in the general population is about 25%. There is familial aggregation of anxiety and mood disorders such as major depression. Genetic factors and life experiences both contribute to the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and uncontrollable worry, is present for longer than 6 months, and tends to occur comorbidly with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders and major depression as well as general medical conditions. GAD, given its chronic nature, is associated with significant impairment. GAD is responsive to pharmacological treatments, such as anxiolytics and antidepressants, as well as psychotherapies such as cognitive therapy.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "Neurally mediated syncope",
      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "title": "Alexithymia, Clinical and Therapeutic Aspects",
      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

In dental practice it may include the difficulties in managing anxious children, or dealing with neurotic, difficult or uncompliant adults. Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide. How does stress manifest in the practice? It may result in absenteeism, increased incident rate, inter-personal aggression, poor quality control, low productivity, high aggression, low productivity, high turnover, reduced morale, complaints and litigation.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

The mild depression of the puerperium has several intriguing aspects. Although it is associated with a critical phase in the life cycle, the dysphoria curiously occurs<i>after</i>delivery at a time when one would expect women to feel joyous.

      "title": "Validation of Stress Assessment Using Mobile Phone",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONStress is a universally experienced phenomenon. It represents a continuum which no single definition can encompass. Stress is considered as an external load or demand on a biological, social or psychological system (Lazarus, 1993). In general terms, stress is defined as the reaction of an organism to a change in its equilibrium. More commonly it is referred to, as, the tension one experiences in response to a threat (Lu et al., 2012). Cumulative stress in daily life impacts negatively on health and societal well-being. Stress being highly pervasive, is widely accepted as the leading cause of illness and diseases. This presents an inherent need to detect and monitor stress as a pre-requisite for eliminating stress and diseases caused due to stress. Yet, despite the scientific advances of modern times, stress continues to be measured only through a self declared questionnaire. Such a questionnaire has several limitations, including lack of portability to measure frequently.Physiologic responses to stress could be used as markers to quantify stress. As a rule, stress does not exist in the absence of stressors. Stressors are stimuli which evoke stress responses. They could be real or imagined, physical or psychological. Physical stressors pose a threat to a person's physical equilibrium such as an electric shock, prolonged exercise, or deprivation of sleep. A psychological stressor on the other hand could be an event that poses a threat to an individual's self-esteem, e.g., the pressure of solving a difficult mental task within a time limit (Lu et al., 2012). It has been recognized that all stressors, whether physical or psychological elicit the same physiological response. Among the various physiological responses to stress such as, changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, respiration, skin conductance etc., cortisol responses function as the chief biomarker of stress. Largest cortisol responses entailing longest time for recovery are found to occur as a result of acute psychological stressors. (Dickerson and Kenney, 2004) These stressors refer to tasks of motivated performance (public speaking and mental arithmetic) with both uncontrollable and social evaluative elements (i.e., task performance could be negatively judged by others) present in them.On the other hand, it has been widely acknowledged (Hecker, Stevens, von Bismarck and Williams, 1968, Scherer, 1986., Tolkmitt and Scherer, 1986) that human voice is influenced by stress. According to Chang, Fischer and Canny (2011) the human voice encodes a wealth of information about emotion, mood and mental state. Variations in speaking fundamental frequency, duration (Griffin and Williams, 1987) amplitude (Brenner and Shipp, 1987) etc., provide for changes in acoustic speech signal that are measured as correlates of stress. Alterations in acoustic signals could be an outcome of changes in respiration during stress. Rate of respiration increases during stress, as a result, sub glottal pressure increases during speech. This in turn increases fundamental frequency or pitch of voice. Increased rate of respiration decreases duration of speech between breaths. Dryness of mouth, activity of the muscles of the larynx, vibrating vocal cords affect the volume velocity through the glottis and thereby fundamental frequency which contribute to changes in speech production under stress. These facts tender human voice as a potential source for stress detection. Voice features that could be influenced by stress include loudness, fundamental frequency, jitter, zero-crossing rate, speech rate and high-energy frequency ratio (Rothkrantz, Wiggers, van Wees and van Vark, 2004). Utilizing these facts the stressMobile-a tool developed to assess stress, demonstrates the possibility of quantifying stress levels from voice features recorded in a mobile phone.The present investigation was conducted to validate stress assessment using stressMobile against salivary cortisol responses to psychologically induced stress task on a sample of university students. …",

      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often identify psychosocial stress as a factor that exacerbates their symptoms, and many trace the onset of symptoms to a stressful period of life or a discrete traumatic incident. However, the pathophysiological relationship between stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder remains poorly characterized: it is unclear whether trauma or stress is an independent cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, a triggering factor that interacts with a preexisting diathesis, or simply a nonspecific factor that can exacerbate obsessive-compulsive disorder along with other aspects of psychiatric symptomatology. Nonetheless, preclinical research has demonstrated that stress has conspicuous effects on corticostriatal and limbic circuitry. Specifically, stress can lead to neuronal atrophy in frontal cortices (particularly the medial prefrontal cortex), the dorsomedial striatum (caudate), and the hippocampus. Stress can also result in neuronal hypertrophy in the dorsolateral striatum (putamen) and amygdala. These neurobiological effects mirror reported neural abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder and may contribute to an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual behavior, an imbalance that is implicated in the pathogenesis and expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology. The modulation of corticostriatal and limbic circuits by stress and the resultant imbalance between habit and goal-directed learning and behavior offers a framework for investigating how stress may exacerbate or trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

Thus, anxiety may be etiologically related to the neurobiological changes that accompany PD and not simply a behavioral reaction to chronic disability. The anxiety disorder in PD tends to be panic, phobic, or generalized anxiety disorder. It can be a manifestation of an \"off\" state, can be worsened by motor fluctuations, or can occur independently from—and even precede—motor manifestations. Anxiety in PD may be directly related to dopaminergic deficit or may be the result of imbalance in other neurochemical pathways. The neurotransmitters primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety are norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid, as well as some neuropeptides. The key to successful management of anxiety in PD is its early recognition. A \"team approach\" to treatment that includes pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures, such as education, counseling, and stress-reduction strategies, is most beneficial, particularly in a complex illness where motor and behavioral dysfunction are often intertwined and tend to affect each other. Well-designed studies that address the pharmacological management of anxiety in PD are needed. Nonetheless, based on clinical experience, the effective agents for primary anxiety disorders seem comparably efficacious in PD-related anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Depression has been conceptualized in two separate ways. Some define the phenomenon by a unique array of psychological abnormalities (a social and behavioural profile). On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

U nezdrave oblike reakcije na traumu ubraja se i posttraumatski stresni poremecaj (PTSP) koji predstavlja anksiozni poremecaj ciji je razvoj povezan s traumatskim događajem. Kao i ostali stresom uzrokovani poremecaji uvelike utjece na opce zdravstveno stanje pojedinca i smanjenje njegove funkcionalnosti na socijalnom i radnom planu. Njegovo je osnovno obilježje razvoj karakteristicnih simptoma, kao odgovor na stresni događaj ili situaciju iznimno prijetece ili katastroficne naravi. Postaviti ispravnu dijagnozu posttraumatskog stresnog poremecaja u klinickom radu nije uvijek lako i jednostavno. Uzrok je tome cesto udruženi komorbiditet te cinjenica da se dijagnoza vecinom temelji na simptomima opisanim od bolesnika. Zbog toga se prilikom postavljanja dijagnoze PTSP-a, kao i bilo kojeg drugog psihickog poremecaja, treba služiti iscrpnim klinickim nalazom te primjenom razlicitih upitnika (testova), a dobivene podatke iskoristiti za izradu sto ucinkovitijeg terapijskog plana. Samo lijecenje, koje nije savrseno i ne znaci potpuni nestanak simptoma vec smanjenje njihove ucestalosti i intenziteta, potrebno je prilagoditi pojedincu kombiniranjem psihoterapijskih, psihofarmakoloskih i psihosocijalnih metoda. U ovom su radu prikazani postupci za dijagnozu PTSP-a, odnosno dijagnosticki kriteriji i metode kao i diferencijalna dijagnostika te lijecenje PTSP-a, odnosno tri važna aspekta koja to lijecenje obuhvacaju: edukacija, psihosocijalna i psihoterapijska podrska i/ili lijecenje i primjena psihofarmakoloskih metoda lijecenja.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

The pathogenesis is multifactorial but is probably often due to changes in the autonomic nervous system, as well as to age-related changes in the cardiovascular and endocrine systems. In addition, the presence of multiple diseases and medications are common contributing factors. Standardized measurement of postural blood pressure and recording of heart rate and assessment of associated symptoms are essential for the clinical diagnosis. Evaluation and management depend on an initial thorough clinical review of problems. Usually elimination of offending medications and treatment of contributing medical disorders are adequate. Occasionally, use of volume expanders and newer experimental agents is indicated. Postural hypotension can be seen as a prototypical clinical disorder of the elderly. It reflects impaired homeostasis; its etiology is multifactorial and due to the effects of both age and disease; it is clinically protean; and it can result in falls, injury, and progressive decline if not recognized and treated early.",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too.

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

Hysteria, by definition, is distinguished both by psychic or physical symptoms reported or voluntarily induced by patients (simulation or pathomimic behaviour) and by somatic disorders having an underlying, associated organic pathology, favoured by an emotional context or a conflictual situation (psychosomatic disorders). The divergence, but above all the analogies between hysterical symptoms and such limits are underlined, showing the frequency of succession with time, associations and transitional forms (\"somatisation disorder\" of the DSM III, psychogenic pain, and psychosomatic disorders termed \"psychofunctional\").",

      "abstract": "Psychological distress and chronic exposure to high levels of stress during medical school can result in a “burnout syndrome” with the potential for multiple detrimental consequences. Burnout syndrome develops as the sequence of emotional exhaustion, followed by depersonalization as a coping mechanism, and which finally manifests itself as feelings of professional dissatisfaction and anguish. If burnout continues into residency and later into medical practice, it will affect the physician’s functioning and quality of life. Interventions targeting unsuccessful coping strategies and complications related to burnout, may offer an opportunity to improve medical student well-being and mental health.",

      "title": "A Review on Depressive Disorders in Cancer Patients",
      "abstract": "Cancer turns from a terminal illness to more of a chronic illness. This perspective has broadened the scope of care from treating the disease alone to managing cancer-related symptoms including mental disorders. Among the nosological forms of comorbid mental pathology in cancer patients, affective disorders (depression and anxiety) predominate. While there is no evidence to support a causal role for depression in cancer, it may impact the course of the disease and a person's ability to participate in treatment. Depressive syndromes are highly correlated with a reduced quality of life, increased difficulty managing the course of disease, and earlier admission to inpatient or hospice care. The most common form of depressive symptomatology in people with cancer is an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, sometimes referred to as reactive depression which may be under-recognized and undertreated. More severe symptoms of depression are of clinical concern because of their association with marked distress, more prolonged hospital stays, physical disorders, poorer treatment compliance and adherence to therapy, disability, increased desire for hastened death and completed suicide. Suicidal statements may range from an off-hand comment resulting from frustration or disgust with a treatment course to a reflection of significant despair and an emergent situation. The diagnosis of depression is difficult due to the problems inherent in distinguishing biological or physical symptoms from symptoms of illness or toxic side effects of treatment. A critical part of cancer care is the recognition of the levels of depression present and determination of the appropriate level of intervention, ranging from brief counseling or support groups to medication and/or psychotherapy. At least one half of all people diagnosed with cancer will successfully adapt. Pharmacotherapy for depression in patients with advanced cancer should be guided by a focus on symptom reduction, irrespective of whether the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for major depression. The optimal antidepressant for specific patients can be determined by each patient's depressive symptom profile and potential dual benefit for depression and cancer-related symptoms such as anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, neuropathic pain and hot flashes. Because of both their adverse effect profiles and risk for lethality in overdose, tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A are rarely used in patients with cancer. Timely and precise diagnosis and appropriate treatment of depression is required in an effort not only to increase quality of life but also to reduce adverse effects on cancer course, length of hospital stay, treatment adherence and efficacy and possibly prognosis and survival.",

They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

      "title": "The impact of severe mental disorders and psychotropic medications on sexual health and its implications for clinical management",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

Osim ostecenja dijelova tijela, nakon politraume osoba može imati i traumatsku ozljedu mozga koja ce utjecati na oporavak i daljnje funkcioniranje bolesnika, ovisno o stupnju i težini ozljede. Bolesnik nakon politraume zahtijeva dugotrajnu hospitalizaciju i lijecenje te samim time dugotrajnu ili cak i trajnu promjenu životnih navika. Psiholoski ucinak ozljede ukljucuje razvoj akutnih i dugorocnih mentalnih problema kao sto su posttraumatski stres, depresija i anksioznost. Posttraumatski stresni poremecaj (PTSP) je najcesce istraživani problem mentalnog zdravlja nakon zadobivanja tjelesnih ozljeda. Prepoznavanje rane pojave poremecaja i ranih simptoma pružaju mogucnosti za rano otkrivanje i prevenciju. Anksioznost se također javlja kod preživjelih nakon politraume, a neki karakteristicni simptomi anksioznosti ukljucuju povecano uzbuđenje i fizicke simptome kao sto su tahikardija, tahipneja i suhoca sluznice usta. Osnovna patofiziologija depresivnog poremecaja nije jasno definirana. Postojeci dokazi upucuju na složenu interakciju između neurotransmitera i regulacije receptora te osjetljivosti koja leži u pozadini afektivnih simptoma.

Uloga medicinske sestre kod bolesnika s psihickim poremecajima nakon politraume je prepoznati simptome koji dovode do određenog poremecaja, te provođenje intervencija prema odredbi lijecnika, uz stvaranje empatijskog odnosa prema bolesniku te pružanje sigurnosti i emocionalne potpore.",

Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder.

This work is a study of the major hormones associated with depression. It was drawn from a literature review, in which corticotrophin hormone, cortisol, estrogen, progesterone and thyroid hormones were identified as the main hormones related to depression. These hormones are essential for the correct functioning of the metabolism, therefore, it is observed that hormonal changes may contribute to the development of depression as well as aggravate it or even hamper the treatment of patients who already have the disorder.",

The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "abstract": "Physical pain, psychological distress and the deleterious effects of medical procedures all cause the chronically ill to suffer as they experience their illnesses. However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person. The data are drawn from a qualitative study of 57 chronically ill persons with varied diagnoses.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

The name given varies—“endogenous depression”, “manic-depressive psychosis/depressive type”, “melancholia” or “depressive illness”. The present generation of laymen (not to say some psychiatrists) use the word “depression” so freely in order to describe an unpleasant, unhappy mood, whether lasting or transient, that one may prefer the term melancholia, or at least “depressive illness”, to signify that condition which justifies the number 301.1. The adjective “endogenous” implies for many that environmental stress plays little or no part in the onset of the illness; we cannot accept that this is always so. The term “reactive” is used in several ways, generally to indicate that the state of unhappiness arises out of some external circumstance and that it would end when circumstances improved or the individual accepted the realities of practical life. The patients used in the present study were suffering from an illness of a kind which we believe may sometimes develop in the absence of severe environmental stress, while in others it may be clearly provoked by circumstances, but the illness, as it develops, may take on a form which becomes largely independent of the environmental circumstances and may continue even when the provoking factors are past; it has become an autonomous melancholia. It will be apparent that by autonomous melancholia we mean an illness shown by clinical experience to respond especially well to electroplexy.",

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

Since specific studies have yielded a relatively large numbers of cases in the past, it can be concluded that the disorder is probably more prevalent than is suggested in the literature. These cases may well be not only primary types, based on mental or unclear causes, but also secondary types, mediated by aberrant somatosensory sensations. Treatment of the underlying condition (in most cases a psychotic or mood disorder) has proved to be increasingly successful over time.Because of the possible co-occurrence of zoanthropy and alterations in coenesthesis, i.e. the sensation of physical existence, mental health workers should be on the lookout for cases of clinical zoanthropy in clinical practice and avoid treating them in the same way as they would treat other delusions. All cases that occur should be subjected to extra somatic investigations – including an EEG and neuroimaging – and treatment should be adjusted in accordance with the findings.",

These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures.

      "title": "Application of the PRECEDE Model to Understanding Postnatal Depression.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fourth Edition (SM-IV-TR) postnatal depression (PND) is not currently recognized as a separate diagnosis. Instead, the DSM-IV-TR recognizes mood problems during the postnatal period using a postnatal onset specifier to several mood disorders including, major depressive, manic or mixed episode of major depressive disorder, bipolar i disorder, bipolar ii disorder and brief psychotic disorder (1).Postnatal depression, that is depression occurs in a mother within 6 weeks of her giving birth, can have profound effects upon the health and wellbeing of the mother, her baby and the family (2) characterized by a number of symptoms including core symptoms of depressed mood and/or loss of pleasure, together with additional symptoms, including changes in weight or sleep, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worth lessens or guiltiness, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation (3). Therefore, PND is a multifactorial disorder with biological, psychological, and sociological aspects interacting with woman's risk individually. In addition to the considerable negative personal impact that PND has on women, PND also negatively affects marital relationships (1). Mothers are fully active in their role, when they feel healthy, and the society considers them healthy. While, PND can be explained by clinical criteria and physical symptoms, social recognition is also effective in this area.PND may also detrimentally affect mother-infant attachment, and infant social and cognitive development. Depressed mothers are less emotionally sensitive and less attuned to their infant's emotional state. These serious implications make PND an important mental illness to study because of the tremendous impact it has on the mother and support system, including child's development and familial relationships (1). The ability of a woman to adjust to these changes affects herself, her infant, other children she may have, and her partner (3). Healthy People 2010 listed improve-ement of the health and well-being of women, infants, children, and families as goal (3).The first step in designing an educational program is selecting a health education model which starts the program on the right way and guides it to the evaluation phase. One of the frequently used models in health education and promotion is the PRECEDE model. We assessed the effectiveness of application of PRECEDE model on pregnant women for preventing PND. We hypothesized that predisposing, enabling and reinforcing would serve as antecedents to postnatal depression. Identifying preventive factors is considered an important step in treatment of PND. Predisposing factors, enabling and reinforcing factors are presented as underlying factors in PRECEDE model and addressing each of these factors by the individual and society plays an important role in prevention of this disorder.Therefore, this study investigated predisposing, enabling and reinforcing as factors that can prevent postnatal depression.The PRECEDE model has been widely applied in health promotion settings. Its main goals are to explain health-related behaviors and to guide the design of interventions that aim to change healthrelated behaviors, their antecedents, and their sequelae (4). The PRECEDE framework attempts to identify a type of education which results in certain changes and eventually leads to Prevented PND. The PRECEDE portion of the model (Phases 1-4) includes social, epidemiological, behavioral, environmental, educational, adminis-trative, and policy assessments. Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model has been developed by Green and Kreuter as a theoretical model to identify the needs of educational programs and health promotion (5). …",

      "title": "Treatment options for situational anxiety in the neurology physician practice",
      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms.

In DSM system, such reactive disorders are listed as adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, a growing number of individuals is suffering from a prolonged feeling of embitterment after exceptional negative life events and this condition could be diagnosed neither PTSD nor adjustment disorder nor depressive disorder in the context of DSM-IV diagnostic system. This clinical condition can be described as 'posttraumatic embitterment disorder' (PTED). PTED is a reactive disorder triggered by exceptional, though normal negative life events such as conflict in the workplace, unemployment, death of a relative, divorce, severe illness, or experience of loss or separation. The common feature of such events is that they are experienced as unjust, as a personal insult, accompanied by psychological violation of basic beliefs and values. The central psychopathological response pattern in PTED is a prolonged feeling of embitterment. In particular, the core emotion of embitterment can lead to the rejection of treatment. Therefore, wisdom therapy as a new treatment approach specifically designed for PTED has been developed. It is assumed that many patients suffering from PTED are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. This review would help to introduce PTED into the clinical field in psychiatry.】",

A number of experiments are described which show that biochemical, physiological and/or pathological changes in an organism do not seem to be caused by the aversive or noxious nature of the stressor but by the ability or inability of the organism to deal with this stressor. If an individual can cope successfully with the environmental challenge, little or no stress is experienced, the challenge is viewed as only minimal stressful and no major health consequences seem to arise. If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise. Thus, coping strategies available to and employed by an individual will determine whether or not stress is experienced, whether or not an event becomes stressful and whether or not pathological consequences will occur.",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

      "title": "Reactions to stressful experiences",
      "abstract": "In biological terms, stress literally means a force from the outside world acting upon an individual, and is a phenomenon we have all experienced. The term ‘stress’ was first used in the 1930s by the endocrin­ologist Hans Selye to describe the responses of la­boratory animals to various stimuli. Originally, Selye meant ‘stress’ to be the response of an organism to a perceived threat or ‘stressor’, but the term is now used to mean the stimulus rather than the response in some cases. When presented with a stressor of any type, everyone will produce a reaction to that stress, and this is a normal physiological event. However, if the reac­tion is prolonged, too intense, or atypical in some way, stress can become abnormal and cause problems. Stressful events, even when reacted to normally, are important contributors to the causes of many kinds of psychiatric disorder. In this chapter, we consider those psychiatric disorders that are specific reactions to stressful experiences. These may occur independently or alongside other psychiatric conditions and include: … ● acute stress reactions: short- term disorders after stressful events; ● post- traumatic stress disorder: a disorder following exceptionally severe stress; ● adjustment disorders: conditions occurring after a change in life circumstances; ● grief reactions: the normal and abnormal responses to bereavement; ● reactions to special kinds of acute stress: for example, traffic accidents, war, earthquakes, etc… For all these conditions, an identifiable stressor is a necessary but not always sufficient factor in its aetiology. GPs encounter the vast majority of patients with stress disorders who present to the health services, but all clinicians will see these patients in their clinical specialties. The reasons for this are threefold: … 1 Acute physical illness and its treatment are stressful. 2 Chronic illness or disability can result in substantial changes in life circumstances. 3 Clinicians treat people involved in other kinds of stressful experiences…. Everyone reacts to stress differently, and what consti­tutes a stressful event is therefore highly subjective. However, there are certain situations that are likely to be experienced as stressful by anyone. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is a list of 43 life events which predispose to stress- related illnesses, weighted ac­cording to their respective probability of doing so.",

      "abstract": "The refusal of food by an insane patient is a troublesome and frequently a serious matter, partly because, from the absence of symptoms in most cases, it is difficult to arrive at a diagnosis of its cause. In many instances it may reasonably be supposed that subjective feelings of pain or discomfort in the stomach, leading to the refusal of food, arise from organic disease or functional disorder of that organ. That there is a centre in the brain, disorder of which causes a distaste for food, has been suggested, but is scarcely worthy of serious consideration. The cause is more likely to be some local affection, such as malignant disease, gastric ulcer, or simple gastritis, giving rise to pain on the ingestion of food; the refusal of food is then the translation of a protest from a stomach in an unfit state to receive any but the lightest food.",

These stressors interact with personality traits and with a genetic predisposition to depression, thereby bringing about mdd. Therefore, the neurobiology of depression cannot be separated from the neurobiology of stress system. A substantial number of publications have in fact demonstrated that mdd patients show abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, which is a key element of the stress response. Such disturbances are exacerbated by chronic stress, early experiences of abuse and even prenatal exposure to stress. On the other hand, genetic variations can play a role in the hpa axis dysfunction and in vulnerability to depression. Evidence is emerging that certain genes are directly involved in the functioning of the hpa axis. Other genetic factors, not directly related to the hpa axis, are probably relevant as well, the best known example being the serotonin transporter gene.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in routine activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure. There are several depression classification systems and diagnostic tools based on clinical symptoms, i.e. the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Scale and Beck's Depression Inventory. Depression frequently occurs in patients with heart failure, as similar pathophysiological mechanisms of neurohormonal activation, arrhythmia, inflammation and hypercoagulation are present in both these diseases. Prognosis in patients with depression is also affected by insufficient cooperation between a patient and his doctor as regards the lifestyle and medication intake of a patient. Depression is usually accompanied by remission and relapse periods which might be related to the current heart failure status of a patient and despite intensive medical treatment they may recur. Depression is often difficult to diagnose or even left undiagnosed and thus untreated, because its symptoms: fatigue, apathy and decreased exercise tolerance, are common in the general population. Furthermore, safety and efficacy of antidepressant therapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases are not well established. Evidence from clinical trials evaluating the influence of depression behavioral and pharmacological treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure is also limited. Taking into account that depression affects prognosis in patients with variety of disorders and common pathological mechanisms present both in depression and heart failure, screening tests for depression should be considered not only in patients with diagnosed heart failure but also those at risk of heart failure development.",

Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

In the acute stress situation these changes rapidly revert to normal with cessation of challenge, but with long continued stress, they may become perpetuated and result in adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. An increasing awareness of the role that stress may play in the etiology of sustained hypertension might well lead to a better control of stress factors in the patient's life.

It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

      "abstract": "Sadness and distress are expectable aspects of the human experience and these have been understood and managed in various ways across culture, time, and place. Currently in the West, intense and sustained periods of sadness are typically labeled as “depression,” understood in terms of biomedical illness, and managed with antidepressant medication and/or psychotherapy. Depression is regarded as one of the most common mental illnesses, with prevalence rates particularly high among women, members of some racial minority groups, and individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or queer. While mainstream formulations focus on individual pathology such as neurochemical imbalance, feminist and critical scholars have highlighted the social and political contexts of people's lives, particularly the ways in which social injustice reliably predicts depressive experiences.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

These disorders may be defined as morbid changes in the muscles, tendons, joints and vertebral column, arising as the result of malfunction or over-function, i.e. stresses which with time or through intensity exceed the limit for the strength of the tissues. The disorders are caused by physical and/or psycho-social circumstances. In treating the different forms of stress disorders, physical activity has been utilised with good results. Training is believed to work both through its favourable effect on the function and physical strength of the various tissues and through its general capacity for relaxing the musculature.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression, a debilitating illness characterised by a persistent depressed mood that impairs normal function, exerts an enormous health and financial cost worldwide. Diagnosis of depression is complex, as not all people experience the same symptoms, with diagnosis based on a series of questions as no biological test is currently available. This is due to the fact that the causes of depression have yet to be fully elucidated, although development of depression appears to be dependent on both genetic and environmental factors. While there is no cure for depression, psychological, pharmacological and brain stimulation approaches successfully manage the symptoms of many patients. However, there are patients that are refractive to current treatments, highlighting the need for improved diagnostics and therapeutics. For this, increased understanding of the neurobiology underlying depression is necessary, requiring further research utilising both animal models of depression and human clinical studies. Key Concepts The diagnosis of depression is complex, is based on the types and duration of the symptoms and is commonly complicated by the presence of comorbid conditions. While there is no cure for depression, symptoms of depression can be managed through a variety of cognitive, pharmacological and brain stimulation approaches. Depression is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Human imaging studies suggest that depression is correlated with activity changes in multiple brain regions. Animal models are necessary to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that lead to depression and to test novel therapeutic strategies.",

It is a disorder that impacts the lives of people who do not receive timely help affecting not only the individual himself in his feelings, thoughts, and behaviors but also harming his relationships and daily life and is prevalent among elderly people. Depression manifests through multiple symptoms, is caused by numerous factors, and is preventable with specific practices.

      "abstract": "Background: Depressive disorders are significantly more common in the medically ill compared to the general population. Depression is associated with worsening of physical symptoms, greater healthcare utilization and poorer treatment adherence. The present paper provides a critical review on the assessment and management of depression in the medically ill. Methods: Relevant articles pertaining to depression in the medically ill were identified, reviewed and synthesized qualitatively. A systematic review was not performed due to the large breadth of this topic, making a meaningful summary of all published and unpublished studies not feasible. Notable studies were reviewed and synthesized by a diverse set of experts to provide a balanced summary. Results: Depression is frequently under-recognized in medical settings. Differential diagnoses include delirium, personality disorders and depressive disorders secondary to substances, medications or another medical condition. Depressive symptoms in the context of an adjustment disorder should be initially managed by supportive psychological approaches. Once a mild to moderate major depressive episode is identified, a stepped care approach should be implemented, starting with general psychoeducation, psychosocial interventions and ongoing monitoring. For moderate to severe symptoms, or mild symptoms that are not responding to low-intensity interventions, the use of antidepressants or higher intensity psychotherapeutic interventions should be considered. Psychotherapeutic interventions have demonstrated benefits with small to moderate effect sizes. Antidepressant medications have also demonstrated benefits with moderate effect sizes; however, special caution is needed in evaluating side effects, drug–drug interactions as well as dose adjustments due to impairment in hepatic metabolism and/or renal clearance. Novel interventions for the treatment of depression and other illness-related psychological symptoms (e.g. death anxiety, loss of dignity) are under investigation. Limitations: Non-systematic review of the literature. Conclusion: Replicated evidence has demonstrated a bidirectional interaction between depression and medical illness. Screening and stepped care using pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is merited.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu.

This dizziness almost always occurs either spontaneously or as a result of certain movements or positions.

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

Studies of this problem explicitly show that the loss of the job exerts a detrimental health effect. A number of other factors decide about the significance of this relationship. The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor. Many authors turn particular attention to a growing intensity of all negative effects of unemployment if it lasts for a long period of time.",

In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses.

Depression is a particularly common and worrisome comorbidity, especially because suicidality seems to be increased significantly in the context of epilepsy. Although psychosocial stressors commonly are associated, intrinsic characteristics of seizure disorders may contribute to the expression of depressive symptoms. Depression and epilepsy may exacerbate each other. Epilepsy with seizure foci in the temporal lobe may represent a higher risk of developing depression, especially if the seizures do not generalize. Treatment of depression is multifaceted and includes psychotherapy and sophisticated regimens of anticonvulsants. Most antidepressants may be used safely and effectively in the context of depression, although high-quality evidence is lacking. Ultimately, treatment of comorbid mood disorder has important implications for outcome and quality of life, perhaps even more than treatment of epilepsy itself.",

      "title": "Brief review of pathophysiological disorders as consequence of psychological stress",
      "abstract": "Background: Psychological stress is a reaction to an unexpected situation that favours adaptation and response to the event. However, when psychological stress is chronic or very intense, it can induce changes in various systems and tissues, causing diseases or aggravating existing ones. Objective: To briefly analyse the pathophysiological conditions caused by psychological stress. Method: A narrative review of the scientific literature on pathophysiological conditions as a consequence of psychological stress was performed. Results: Psychological stress can induce various conditions at the gastrointestinal, immune and cardiovascular levels. This is mainly due to the neurobiological and endocrine response because when faced with a stressful stimulus, a deregulated release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines is generated, altering the normal physiology of the organism. Gastrointestinal disorders are mainly due to goblet cell dysfunction, resulting in intestinal hyperpermeability, inflammation and infection. Changes at the immune level lead to an increase in inflammatory responses but a decrease in the protective activities of the immune system. Finally, cardiovascular conditions include atherosclerosis, increased blood pressure and stroke. Conclusion: Psychological stress can induce real physiological pathologies and, in some cases, fatal ones. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies have already been studied and identified. Knowledge of these molecular mechanisms can help clinicians and therapists to improve the treatment and therapy of patients.",

      "abstract": "Funktionelle Erkrankungen des Magendarmtrakts sind uberaus haufig. Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

      "title": "Trauma as a life event and its impact on suicidal behaviour",
      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

      "title": "Psicosis instrumental: a propósito de dos probables casos",
      "abstract": "El Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de los Trastornos Mentales (DSM-5) define a la simulación como la representación intencional de síntomas físicos o psicológicos falsos o muy exagerados, motivada por incentivos externos diversos, aunque reconoce que, en muchos casos, la simulación puede tener cierto valor adaptativo. Estrictamente hablando, la simulación no es un trastorno mental sino un problema que puede ser objeto de atención clínica. Sin embargo, se presume erróneamente que la simulación podría darse solamente en contextos forenses, lo que dificulta su identificación en ámbitos clínicos. La “psicosis instrumental” es una variante de simulación consistente en el fingimiento de síntomas por parte de un individuo con diagnóstico subyacente de una psicosis primaria y que simula sus síntomas en momentos de estabilidad clínica. Se presentan dos casos de personas con diagnóstico primario de esquizofrenia que pueden ser considerados también como aparentes casos de psicosis instrumental. No existen reportes previos de este trastorno en nuestro país, aunque presumiblemente su número no debe ser exiguo. Se revisa también la literatura pertinente a este interesante fenómeno que, más alláde su naturaleza psicopatológica, parece reflejar conductas de una definida índole psicosocial.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "title": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN",
      "abstract": "In the holistic approach in medicine а person is viewed through the bio-psycho-social model. Human health is a trinity of “soma” (body), “psyche” (soul) and social role (position) that are constantly interacting with each other and with the environment. Any action on one of the dimensions inevitably affects the others. Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. They cause social, economic and psychological burden for individuals, their families and the whole society. Much of the socially significant diseases (especially cancer and degenerative diseases) are associated with chronic pain. Epidemiological data shows that between 10.1% and 55.2% of people in different countries suffer from chronic pain. Pain has been shown to affect all dimensions of health related to quality of life. Patients with chronic pain also suffer from depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Limitation of physical activity leads to overweight and all additional health risks related to this condition. Depression, inability to work, impaired social contacts and suicidal thoughts make chronic pain a public health problem. Drug medication along with psychological support and social commitment are important elements of holistic integrated care for patients with chronic pain.The purpose of this article is to analyze the ethical considerations of integrative care for patients with chronic pain.In modern medical ethics autonomy is basic principle. In bioethics autonomy means “the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision for your health”. To participate in the decision-making process patients, need sufficient and comprehensive information. The right to information is a basic patient’s right and obligation of the physician. The partnership model is of great importance in the treatment of chronic diseases. The patient is engaged as part of the therapeutic team, actively participates in the healing process and implements self-management of the disease. Numerous studies have proven that patient involvement improves medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in healthcare. The communication between the doctor and the patient is a cornerstone and a premise for quality medical care.In conclusion, in the age of high-tech medicine, the human factor and patient-centered care have remained intact. Good awareness of patients is of key importance for their participation in the treatment. Easily available, true and relevant information is a prerequisite for understanding the pain control options.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar.

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Intense or chronic stress can have long-lasting consequences in an individual's health, and can be the cause of debilitating mental illnesses. A very common mental illness induced by traumatic stress is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a syndrome of symptoms indicative of emotional dysfunction, which develop after exposure to life-threatening events, or very stressful situations of different nature. Prevalent symptoms are fear and anxiety, which become particularly intense during exposure to situations reminiscent of the traumatic events that precipitated the disease. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder of considerable prevalence and morbidity and can affect persons of any age and ethnic or socioeconomic background. It is, unfortunately, a far too common result of participation in wars. In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that the prevalence of PTSD is even higher in inner city communities exposed to compound community trauma. It is imperative, therefore, to understand the neurobiological mechanisms by which exposure to traumatic stress leads to PTSD in order to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD. Clinical evidence indicates that certain stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD are associated with changes in the amygdala's excitability. The amygdala is a key component of the brain's neuronal network that determines the emotional significance of external events",

The presence of psychotic features has a profound influence on the course and treatment response of mood disorders, and psychotic disorders in turn are influenced by coexisting dysregulation of mood. Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy. The results of treatment are usually positive.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta. En este articulo se pretende revisar las posibles evolu- ciones y sus opciones terapeuticas, abordar si existe riesgo de encarnizamiento terapeutico, y finalizar con algunas cuestiones de la vida de estos pacientes que influyen en el afronta- miento de la enfermedad EnglishDepression is the most frequent psychia- tric illness in elderly patients. It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Empirical results from epidemiological studies on pain-depression comorbidity in primary care and population samples have shown that: (a) pain is as strongly associated with anxiety as with depressive disorders; (b) characteristics that most strongly predict depression are diffuseness of pain and the extent to which pain interferes with activities; (c) certain psychological symptoms (low energy, disturbed sleep, worry) are prominent among pain patients, while others (guilt, loneliness) are not; (d) depression and pain dysfunction are evident early in the natural history of pain, but dysfunction and distress are often transient; and (e) among initially dysfunctional pain patients whose dysfunction is chronic, depression levels do not improve but neither do they increase over time with chronicity alone. These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event.

Physical activity has been consistently shown to be associated with improved physical health, life satisfaction, cognitive functioning, and psychological well-being. Conversely, physical inactivity appears to be associated with the development of psychological disorders. Specific studies support the use of exercise as a treatment for depression. Exercise compares favorably to antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression and has also been shown to improve depressive symptoms when used as an adjunct to medications. While not as extensively studied, exercise has been shown to be an effective and cost-efficient treatment alternative for a variety of anxiety disorders.

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

Two recent studies showed how depressive symptoms accounted for much more of the variance in morbidity in Parkinson’s disease (40%) than did movement disorder (17%).1,2 Critics of these studies could rightly point out that before the advent of L-dopa, motor disorder was definitely the biggest contributor to morbidity in Parkinson’s disease, and that quality of life as a measure is more directly related to mood state …",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders represent an array of phenomena characterized by abnormal movements during or just preceding sleep. The majority of sleep-related movement disorders is represented by benign conditions which have no known adverse effects on health. Many of these disorders include muscular jerking of the torso or legs. Some disorders consist of repetitive movement of the legs. The severity of each of these disorders varies greatly and, in severe forms, the sleep-related movement disorders can result in sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, similar movements can arise from disease of muscle, nerve, spinal cord or even brain, so if movement is frequent or severe, it is best to consult a health care professional.",

      "title": "Factores Asociados a la Carga Mental en Docentes de Instituciones Educativas Ecuatorianas",
      "abstract": "Introducción: Ciertos sectores económicos en pandemia establecieron el decremento de la carga física de los trabajadores, relacionadas con sus tareas de carácter manual; éstas a la vez, fueron reemplazadas por el incremento permanente de actividades vinculadas a funciones cognitivas y psicosociales que se corresponden íntimamente a la carga mental, que se constituye en uno de los factores de mayor influencia para el riesgo laboral y adquiere gran interés, esencialmente por las nuevas formas de organización del trabajo; así como también, los avances tecnológicos e informáticos, que demandan de mayores esfuerzos cognoscitivos e intelectuales. La carga mental genera tensiones en el trabajador, provocadas por distintas variables concernientes a los requerimientos laborales; dada la relación que se produce entre éstas y las capacidades mentales o recursos propios de la persona para afrontarlas, junto con los procesos cognitivos y aspectos afectivos del individuo.Se han descrito efectos en la salud y ciertos componentes de riesgo mental se expresan como síntomas depresivos y estrés, afines con otros elementos específicos de las profesiones como: agotamiento, cansancio físico y fatiga generalizada, lesiones musculares, perturbación del sueño y exposición a situaciones y comportamientos de violencia en el contexto laboral. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), ha reconocido que el bienestar de los trabajadores, no solo se condiciona por peligros en el lugar de trabajo, sino también por factores sociales e individuales. Las consecuencias que surgen a raíz de los intentos por superar las condiciones precarias que enfrenta el trabajador, llevan a una connotación negativa de las cargas físicas, psíquicas y fisiológicas, que a futuro se manifiestan en cargas mentales excesivas difíciles de manejar lo que genera un decrecimiento en la productividad. En Ecuador, las políticas públicas, no han considerado aún la salud mental como parte de la salud pública; de ahí, la necesidad de iniciar su discusión, análisis y propuesta.Objetivo: El estudio tiene como propósito fundamental determinar los factores asociados a la carga mental de los docentes de diferentes niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico, conforme a la normativa vigente ecuatoriana.Materiales y Métodos: Se aplicó una metodología con enfoque cuantitativo. Fue aplicado el cuestionario CarMen-Q que evalúa cuatro dimensiones de carga mental: dimensión cognitiva, temporales, requisitos de desempeño y aspectos emocionales. Consta de 29 ítems, con un formato de respuesta mediante Escala Likert. El instrumento se aplicó en línea a 111 docentes de Ecuador de niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico. Para analizar los resultados se recurrió a técnicas estadísticas multivariantes como Análisis de Componentes Principales y estadística descriptiva para análisis de los datos socio demográficos.Resultados: Los resultados sugieren que los factores asociados a la carga mental, se relacionan con la gestión de información, la dimensión emocional, carga laboral y la presión por rendimiento, al que deben responder en este caso los docentes de las instituciones educativas investigados.Conclusiones: Los docentes enfrentan dificultades para responder a las demandas de las tareas. Estas, están directamente relacionadas con las dimensiones cognitivas, de rendimiento y temporales, sin dejar de lado, aquellas vinculadas con la subjetividad humana como corresponde a las emociones, sentimientos y vivencias, más aún cuando el ejercicio de la docencia involucra la interacción directa entre seres humanos.",

Nicht jede Art von Tremor ist krankhaft und der physiologische Tremor des Normalen sogar unvermeidbares Begleitsymptom jeder muskulären Aktivität. Der pathologische Tremor ist demgegenüber gekennzeichnet durch eine vergrößerte Tremoramplitude, in der Regel durch niedrigere Tremorfrequenzen und häufig durch Auftreten unter unphysiologischen Aktivierungsbedingungen (z.B. Ruhetremor). Die medikamentösen Behandlungserfolge bei allen Tremorformen sind häufig unbefriedigend. Da bei den meisten Tremores der genaue Ort und die Art der Pathologie im zentralen Nervensystem unbekannt ist, gibt es kaum kausale Behandlungsansätze. So hat es bis heute in der spezifischen medikamentösen Behandlung pathologischer Tremores keine wesentlichen Durchbrüche gegeben, die dem Erfolg des Levodopa beim M. Parkinson vergleichbar wären. Deshalb ist der fortgeschrittene pathologische Tremor seit längerem eines der Zielsymptome funktioneil stereotaktischer Behandlungsverfahren. Seit Einführung der tiefen Hirnstimulation, die bei vielen fortgeschrittenen pathologischen Tremores zu einer dramatischen Reduktion der Tremoramplitude führt und weniger Risiken als die läsionellen Verfahren birgt, ist die operative Behandlung zu einer wichtigen Säule der Tremortherapie geworden. Im Folgenden werden zunächst Klinik, Pathophysiologie und die Grundzüge der Pharmakotherapie pathologischer Tremores dargestellt und dann die Möglichkeiten der tiefen Hirnstimulation bei den verschiedenen Tremores auf dem derzeitigen Wissensstand zusammengefasst.",

It is a multidetermined biopsychosocial disorder in which physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical expression of the disorder. These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome. Currently, clinical outcome has become understood in terms of global symptom relief and health-related quality of life.",

      "title": "Treatments in depression",
      "abstract": "Major depression is believed to be a multifactorial disorder involving predisposing temperament and personality traits, exposure to traumatic and stressful life events, and biological susceptibility. Depression, both unipolar and bipolar, is a \"phasic\" disease. Stressful life events are known to trigger depressive episodes, while their influence seems to decrease over the course of the illness. This suggests that depression is associated with progressive stress response abnormalities, possibly linked to impairments of structural plasticity and cellular resilience. It therefore appears crucial to adequately treat depression in the early stages of the illness, in order to prevent morphological and functional abnormalities. While evidence suggests that a severely depressed patient needs antidepressant drug therapy and that a non-severely depressed patient may benefit from other approaches (ie, \"nonbiological\"), little research has been done on the effectiveness of different treatments for depression. The assertion that the clinical efficacy of antidepressants is comparable between the classes and within the classes of those medications may be true from a statistical viewpoint, but is of limited value in practice. The antidepressant drugs may produce differences in therapeutic response and tolerability. Among the possible predictors of outcome in depression treatment, those derived from clinical assessment, neuroendocrine investigations, polysomnographic sleep parameters, genetic variables, and brain imaging techniques have been extensively studied. This article also reviews therapeutic strategies used when initial treatment fails, and describes briefly new concepts in antidepressant therapies such as the regulation of disturbances in circadian rhythms. The treatment of depressive illness does not stop with treatment of acute episodes, and has to be envisaged as a continuous therapeutic intervention, of which we are still not able to determine the optimal duration of treatment and the moment that it should be ceased.",

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

A multidimensional way of contemplation has to be gone even if the actual situation of the illness and the point of view of the physician put either the somatic-biological, or the psychic or the social aspect in evidence. In this case the visible symptom leads to detect the intra-psychic and interhuman problems and conflicts.

The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue fracture of the pelvis is the form of fracture due to repetitive micro-stress accumulation, can be affected by a number of factors such as patient's nutritional status, biomechanics, social status and so on. Still there is no study about precise standard degree of external force that lead to stress fracture, but it may caused by compression force, traction force or complex force and others. Avulsion stress to ischial tuberosity or anterior superior iliac spine by attached muscle is known as the main factor for the avulsion fracture. This report will deal with 19 years old conscripted policeman who occurred ischial tuberosity avulsion fracture after training of 6-hour running for 5 days accompanying hip hyper-flexion motion. This reports aims to provide case study of stress fracture occurred after 5 days of exercise which is relatively short period who had no specific trauma history or pain.",

      "abstract": "Certain mental disorders seen in geriatric psychiatry include depression, dementia, and delirium. The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Delirium oppstår oftest etter kirurgi og under intensivbehandling, og er en akutt forvirringstilstand på grunn av forstyrrelser i hjernens funksjoner. Patofysiologien er uklar, men delirium har en identifiserbar organisk årsak. Forløpet er fluktuerende og kan utvikle seg over tid. Symptomene kan være desorientering, hukommelsessvikt, hallusinasjoner og persepsjonsforstyrrelser (1). Pasientene blir svært sårbare fordi de har redusert evne til å ta del i, påvirke, eller kontrollere egen situasjon (2). Intensivmiljøet inneholder fysiske, psykiske og miljømessige faktorer som kan utløse et delirium, for eksempel respiratorbehandling, sedasjon, alvorlighetsgrad av kritisk sykdom, mangel på døgnrytme og farmakologisk påvirkning. Predisponerende faktorer som demens eller kognitiv dysfunksjon, depresjon, alvorlig sykdom eller komorbiditet er også tilstede hos pasienten før sykehusinnleggelse (3, 4). Det er rapportert om delirium hos nær 87% av alle respiratorbehandlede pasienter. Ubehandlet delirium kan påvirke pasientens kliniske tilstand, og føre til redusert kontinuitet i behandlingen, lengre behandlingstid, økte kostnader og i verste fall økt mortalitet (5). Pasientens adferd deles inn i hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium, eller en kombinasjon av begge tilstandene. Hyperaktivt delirium er klassisk beskrevet som at pasienten er aggressive og utagerende, og ute av stand til å samarbeide. Hypoaktivt delirium viser seg ved svekket oppmerksomhet og bevissthet, og nedsatt psykomotorisk aktivitet. Det er høyest forekomst av pasienter i hypoaktivt delirium. På grunn av vage symptomer er det vanskeligere å avdekke. Dette fører til at langtidsprognosen for pasienter med hypoaktivt delirium er dårlig (5, 6). Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) er et validert kartleggingsverktøy som benyttes for å avdekke tilstanden hos intuberte pasienter som ikke kan kommunisere verbalt (4, 7, 8). Rutinemessig screening med et slikt kartleggingsverktøy for å avdekke delirium er anbefalt. Likevel viser forskning at tilstanden er underdiagnostisert (9, 10).",

      "title": "The confusing tale of depression and distress in patients with diabetes: a call for greater clarity and precision",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies have identified significant linkages between depression and diabetes, with depression associated with poor self‐management behaviour, poor clinical outcomes and high rates of mortality. However, findings are not consistent across studies, yielding confusing and contradictory results about these relationships. We suggest that there has been a failure to define and measure ‘depression’ in a consistent manner. Because the diagnosis of depression is symptom‐based only, without reference to source or content, the context of diabetes is not considered when addressing the emotional distress experienced by individuals struggling with diabetes. To reduce this confusion, we suggest that an underlying construct of ‘emotional distress’ be considered as a core construct to link diabetes‐related distress, subclinical depression, elevated depression symptoms and major depressive disorder ( MDD ). We view emotional distress as a single, continuous dimension that has two primary characteristics: content and severity; that the primary content of emotional distress among these individuals include diabetes and its management, other life stresses and other contributors; and that both the content and severity of distress be addressed directly in clinical care. We suggest further that all patients, even those whose emotional distress rises to the level of MDD or anxiety disorders, can benefit from consideration of the content of distress to direct care effectively, and we suggest strategies for integrating the emotional side of diabetes into regular diabetes care. This approach can reduce confusion between depression and distress so that appropriate and targeted patient‐centred interventions can occur.",

Most of the patients who use the services of the Kainuu Central hospital pain clinic suffer from low back pain. IASP (International Association of the study of Pain) defines pain as unpleasant sensory or emotional experience with possible or clear tissue damage, or which is described at the same way. Acute and chronic pain differ from each other clearly. Acute pain warns about danger that is threatening the human body. This starts us to evaluate the situation and to act upon the danger. Behind an acute pain is always some somatic disturbance or disease. Acute pain causes also many changes in the autonomic nervous system; blood pressure, muscle tension and heart rate raise when the body is in the alarm position. Chronic pain doesn't warn the body about threatening danger because clear pathology doesn't always exist. Chronic pain reduces human life. It causes zest for life, tiring and reluctance. The chronic pain brings also following symptoms: sleeping disturbances, depression, social isolation, unemployment and loss of control of life.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

Direct injury to the muscle itself from accident or operation, damage to its nerve supply anywhere along the course of the fibers from the cerebral cortex to the end-organs in the muscle, and certain congenital defects from which either the muscle or its nerve supply is defective are the principal types of lesions which result in incontinence of feces. For some of these conditions, efforts have been made in the past to repair the damaged muscle by suture or plastic operations of various sorts. Others",

      "title": "The Nature of Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is arbitrary, being based on criteria defined by consensus rather than specific biologic markers. IBS is merely a consortium of symptoms and as presently defined is no more a disease than dyspnea or fatigue are diseases. In this context, it is therefore not surprising that defining the nature of pain has proven elusive. It is often etiologically assumed that the origins of the pain seen in IBS patients are mechanistically distinct from those of some of the other symptoms of IBS such as diarrhea and constipation. In addition pain is assumed to be part of a continuum ranging from complete absence of any pain to varying degrees of discomfort to severe pain. Both of these assumptions should be challenged: there are no data to support the notion that discomfort and pain experienced in IBS are mediated through different pathways than symptoms such as bloating or that they are not merely the consequence of the physiological perturbations associated with altered bowel function. Similarly one can easily argue that visceral pain may actually be the cause rather than the effect of the altered gut function seen in IBS. Abdominal discomfort could then be the consequence of the latter and be only indirectly related to pain. It is likely that central (such as stress) and peripheral factors (such as intestinal infection) will produce similar symptoms but via markedly different pathways. It may be time to deconstruct IBS as a concept and to approach the clinical picture from a mechanistic rather than a phenomenological perspective, particularly if we are interested in understanding the basis of the symptoms and develop effective therapeutic modalities. Our patients deserve no less.",

The etiology of any anxiety is sought in early conditioning life experiences; here it may be related to infants' responses to first teething. The universality of dental anxiety makes it a paradigm of psychosomatic disorders. These are conceptualized as pathologic exaggerated reactions to early traumatizing events, a causality not unlike that of conversive-hysteric symptoms or \"normal\" bodily characteristics. Psychiatric-etiologic considerations of dental anxiety are not to be found in the literature. Recalling the cheerful manner in which children's loss of their first tooth is greeted, one gathers that repressed ambivalence is involved.

      "title": "Happiness and neurological diseases",
      "abstract": "Happiness is an emotional state reflecting positive feelings and satisfaction with life, which, as an outcome in disease states or as an end point in clinical trials, is a neglected concept in most therapeutic areas. In neurological disease, happiness is important as it can be diminished either as a direct result of damage to neuronal tissue or as a reaction to a poor prognosis. The monitoring and maintenance of happiness and wellbeing have historically been considered to be peripheral to medicine. However, as happiness interacts with the patient’s physical health, it is an important parameter to assess alongside all aspects of any given disease. Happiness provides a reliable overview of the patient’s general status over and above standard parameters for quality of life, and is more wide-ranging than the narrow measures of disease activity or treatment efficacy that are the focus of most clinical trials. In many studies, happiness has been associated with health and success in most areas of life, including performance at work, sporting achievement and social functioning. For approximately a decade, previously studied aspects of psychology have been grouped under the label of positive psychology (PoP). Principles of this discipline are now being used to guide some treatments in neurological and psychiatric diseases. PoP aims to define patient wellbeing in scientific terms and to increase understanding of happiness, meaning in life, resilience and character strengths, as well as to determine how this knowledge can be applied clinically to promote health. Some evidence has emerged recently suggesting that improvements in patient status can result from interventions to improve the patient’s level of happiness in diseases, including epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and stroke. Several effective approaches to increase happiness employ activities to engage and stimulate patients who might otherwise be unoccupied and isolated. In addition, specific interventions to increase happiness developed by PoP clinicians have demonstrated efficacy and validity. Several measurement scales now exist that reliably measure happiness as a long-term state, rather than as a fluctuating condition resulting from prevailing mood. These enable the use of happiness as an end point in clinical trials. As happiness becomes increasingly accepted as an important consideration in neurological disease, it is likely to be monitored more extensively, with measures to raise happiness levels being taken as an effective means of improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder is a mood disorder that affects millions of people each year, in many cases leading to disability or even suicide. Its symptoms, as outlined in the DSM ‐5 , include low mood, fatigue, loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, difficulty sleeping or eating normally, trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. These symptoms have been described in many forms throughout history, dating back at least to the time of Hippocrates (460–370 BC ) and the ancient Greek diagnosis of melancholia. Modern clinicians and researchers have proposed a variety of cognitive, biological, and social/environmental theories to explain the cause of major depressive disorder. The disorder is commonly assessed via clinical interview and/or self‐report questionnaires. First‐line treatments for major depressive disorder include psychotherapy and antidepressant medications.",

      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

All nine DSM-IV symptoms of major depression were found to characterize a class with a high chance (96%) of having a clinical diagnosis of major depression, and symptoms of anxiety were also frequent. Other psychiatric symptoms may also be included under the construct of depression in AD, since both apathy and anxiety are among the most frequent comorbid conditions for major depression in AD. Subtypes of depression should also be validated in this condition. For instance, increased awareness of cognitive and functional deficits is significantly associated with dysthymia but not with major depression, suggesting that different depressive syndromes in AD may have different etiology.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "title": "Inquadramento diagnostico e gestione farmacologica della depressione senile Assessment and pharmacological management of elderly depression",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression is chronic and disabling and is an important factor for elderly suicide. The prevalence of depression in the elderly has attracted extensive research effort and yelded a wide range of estimates, depending on diagnostic criteria, the method of detecting depression, the experience of the interviewers and, most importantly, the characteristics of this population. Major Depression appears to be less common in the elderly than in younger adults, but subsyndromal depression is more prevalent. DSM diagnostic criteria require either depressed mood or loss of interest, but these symptoms appear to be less prominent in the elderly, being anxiety, irritability and physical symptoms more significant indicators of elderly depressive states. Depression in the elderly is essentially heterogeneous and has a multifactorial etiopathogenesis (Fig. 1): this has contributed to its underrecognition, underestimation and undertreatment. The “atypical” clinical presentation of depression in the elderly as somatic symptoms, anxiety, changes in functional ability, loss of capacity to enjoy life or loss of interest in usual activities, can be misleading for the clinician and masks an underlying mood disorder. Even “pseudodementia” is clinically important since it may result in failure to recognize and treat either depression or dementia. Comorbidity with a physical illness such as cardiovascular disease or other psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety) is frequent in late-life depression, and the presence of one or more medical illnesses may influence the diagnosis of depression; moreover, it represents a negative prognostic factor for response to antidepressant therapy. The pharmacological management of depression in late life is complicated by physiological changes associated with aging (Fig. 2), higher sensitivity to develop side-effects, concomitant medical disorders with drug-drug interaction phenomena and compliance problems. These factors need to be carefully taken into account when selecting antidepressants for the treatment of depressive states in the elderly. Antidepressants are as effective in the elderly as they are earlier in life. The development of newer antidepressants has focused on compounds that are better tolerated, with reduced unwanted effects and more likely to be used in long-term treatment. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonergic/Noradrenergic Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI), (e.g. venlafaxine) and Noradrenergic/Serotonergic Specific Antagonist (NaSSA), (e.g.mirtazapine), show a more favourable side-effects profile and appear to be more suitable for the treatment of elderly depression. In selecting the appropriate treatment, the physician should take account of concomitant illnesses and current therapies, choosing an agent with a simple once-daily regimen and a larger pharmacodynamic and therapeutic spectrum (e.g. on depressive and anxiety symptoms). However, a comprehensive management of elderly depressive states should include not only the physician, but also a psychological and psychosocial support, which appears important to explore stressors for depression and to educate patients and their families about depressive illness and its treatment.

The thymopathic factor (manic-depressive constitutional tendency) is one among a number of other dynamic factors in the production of manic-depressive and allied psychoses rather than representing an independent disease entity. 2. Although hereditary and other more or less static constitutional factors undoubtedly play a very definite rôle, their influence is of a general nature.

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse.

Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data.

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

Unfortunately, there is as yet no simple, definitive test for detecting depression. Family physicians must be aware that depression is very often masked by somatic or anxiety complaints. A pattern of increased office visits, with a constellation of varied functional somatic complaints, perhaps accompanied by disturbances in social relationships, often indicates the presence of a developing depression. Although hospitalization or psychiatric referral or both are in order for complex psychiatric diagnoses or for suicidal patients, the morbidity and the mortality of depression can be reduced by the alert family physician who provides both carefully managed antidepressant treatment and supportive therapy early in the course of the illness.",

      "title": "Stress, stigmatization and psychosomatic purpuras.",
      "abstract": "Stress is a term that is readily recognized by everyone but defines rigorous scientific definition. It is widely interpreted as the emotional and biologic responses to novel or threatening situations. In humans, however, the term \"distress\" seems to be preferable, more clearly defining the fact that is the response that is being referred to, rather than the stimulus. Distress has been postulated to be capable of precipitating an overt illness, as when it occurs coincidentally with an incipient infection or neoplasm. Moreover, it is able to provoke several disorders and symptoms in many tissues and organs, including the skin. In this paper the authors focus on the main characteristics of stress and emphasize the relevance of psychosomatic medicine that proposes the simultaneous examination of psyche and soma. Special consideration is given to a peculiar form of skin disease, psychogenic purpura, together with the stigmata of mystics that, in large part, seem to be conditioned or provoked (or provocable) by emotional stress or by psychic influences on cutaneous fibrinolytic activity.",

Descriptions of the symptoms, as we have described throughout this book, and as spelled out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), serve as the point of departure—symptoms that are not just fleeting, but recurrent or persistent. The symptoms must also not be occurring exclusively and only in the context of some other condition, be it psychiatric, medical, or related to substance use. If, for example, the depersonalization happened only when the person was deeply depressed, or during a panic attack, or a seizure, or because a person has a brain tumor, he or she would not be diagnosed as having DPD. Likewise, regular substance users (daily drinkers or marijuana users) who experience depersonalization only in that context would not be diagnosed with DPD.",

Their general occurrence is reflected in phrases like “it makes me sick” and “to sweat with fear”. In some groups of people these autonomic disturbances are not confined to stressful situations but become more general and frequent and so more disabling. For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease.

Asi, los trastornos del estado de animo no son mas que la perturbacion o la alteracion del humor del individuo, los cuales varian en intensidad y calidad. De esa forma, el rasgo esencial de los trastornos de esta categoria es que todos reflejan un desequilibrio en la reaccion emocional o de estado de animo que no se debe a ningun otro trastorno fisico o mental. Estos se conocen tambien como trastornos afectivos. Por ello, se deduce que los trastornos del estado de animo durante la senectud se acompanan de complejidades nosologicas, fenomenologicas, diagnosticas y terapeuticas que requieren conocimientos especiales. Son frecuentes presentaciones clinicas poco visuales como depresion oculta y pseudo demencia que pueden confundir el diagnostico de cualquier enfermedad.

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised. There is evidence for the benefit of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in high doses for at least 12 weeks, as in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "abstract": "Most movement disorders in children are hyperkinetic. The most common type is tic disorders, which can involve motor and phonic tics and are classified as simple or complex. Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most widespread and common disorders of today. It belongs to internalized disorders or disorders of over-controlled behavior. This emotional state is characterized by feelings of sadness, sorrow, inactivity, and represents the universal and increasingly frequent life experience of modern man. Life events (changes) and influential social factors can be a trigger for depression. Causes can also be biological or genetic. Depression affects all age groups, but not everyone in the same way, with the same intensity or persistence. Also, each group has different causes with regard to age and life experience. It was generally thought that depression was a disease that affected only adults, but it turned out that it was not. It is more difficult to diagnose it at preschool and school age, but in adolescence it is easier because it is a period of the most turbulent change and the symptoms are more visible. One of the dangers of this disorder is that it can lead to suicide. Suicide is not a disorder in itself, but one of the possible outcomes of severe depression.Young people should be taught first and foremost for self-help and self-protection, as well as helped to preserve and promote mental and physical health. They should be objectively informed of all the harmful consequences that may arise as a product of reckless thinking, ideas and behavior. Depression affects the life of an individual by disturbing relationships with close people and can lead to the use of addictive agents. It is treated with different types of psychotherapy and / or pharmacological agents. The combination of all treatments has proven to be the most effective. Psychological educational work with teachers on this disorder has also shown to be effective. It is certainly needed in order for the teacher to recognize the symptoms and to support the child in crisis situations.",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

      "title": "Identifying the constructs to non-melancholic depression: stress",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 1, the binary model of depression viewed one ‘type’ of depression (i. e. reactive or neurotic depression) as essentially being a response to a major or salient life-event stressor. By contrast, the other type of depression (endogenous or melancholic) was seen as a condition that occurred without any such trigger, with the term ‘endogenous’ emphasising that the depression came from ‘within’ rather than from stressors and the environment. We now turn to examine the role of life-event stressors in those with non-melancholic disorders. Life-event stressors may, theoretically, be all-explanatory and contribute totally to the onset of the depressive disorder. Terms such as ‘reactive depression’ and ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’ emphasise the contribution of a life event and do not recognise any predisposing or other factor. While life events may vary in their magnitude, one could posit that most of these ‘pure state’ reactions are likely to be in response to cataclysmic or extremely severe depressing events, and where it might be imagined that most people would develop such a depressive condition.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

The consequences of advanced disease can comprise emotional states such as anxiety, distress and depressive episodes, fear of being a burden to others, loss of control, anger, loss of sense of dignity, uncertainty, and changes in close relationships and social roles. Adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and the demoralization syndrome represent common disorders and phenomena among patients with advanced cancer. Moreover, uncontrollable pain and high unrelieved physical symptom burden, depression, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, delirium, and low family support are major factors in the desire for thoughts of suicide and the desire for hastened death. Caregivers play an important and challenging role, providing emotional and social support for the patient, helping with medical needs, and meeting increasingly complex instrumental needs such as running the household and work.",

The symptoms may vary from discomfort and pain to decreased body function and invalidity. Although it is not clear to what extent MSDs are caused by work, their impact on working life is huge. MSDs can interfere with activities at work and can lead to reduced productivity, sickness absence and chronic occupational disability [1].",

Se define el estrés y se clasifica desde diferentes perspectivas. El estrés es una causa de tensión y exigencia o mecanismo de adaptación.El estrés y la presentación del primer episodio depresivo están directamente relacionados, sin embargo cuando se presentan recurrencias el estrés significativo pierde fuerza dentro de los factores que lo desencadenan. Los estresores, especialmente los psicosociales, están relacionados con la presentación de recurrencias. Entre estos se destacan estresores internos y externos, por sucesos vitales, estrés de rol y las contrariedades cotidianas, la alta exigencia y el perfeccionismo. El no cumplimiento de metas es otro factor provocador de crisis en la transición del ciclo vital. El neuroticismo y el perfeccionismo, como actitudes disfuncionales provocan aislamiento y falta de soporte social. Los esquemas cognitivos disfuncionales conducen a un procesamiento erróneo de la información. La depresión es una pauta de relación que no permite encontrar formas adaptativas de enfrentar la vida y conducir las relaciones interpersonales. Aunque hay nuevas visiones que la consideran como un esfuerzo adaptativo. La comorbilidad puede hacer recurrir la depresión. Se ha sugerido que patrones maladaptativos cognitivos, en particular en interacción con estresores, podrían llevar a pobres resultados en el tratamiento de sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor en comorbilidad con trastornos de personalidad. Estos, independientemente del estado de la depresión, han sido asociados con elevadas actitudes disfuncionales.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

There are different kinds of trauma or stresses. There are some that are cause by natural disaster, some by warfare trauma, violence on civilians, sexual assault, physical assault, psychological assault and others. PTSD was first described on soldiers who participated in the American civil war. Mental problems in soldiers which took part in the First World War, experts of that era considered functional and labeled the term grenade shock. Upon completion of the Second World War, the observed psychological disturbances of war participants were termed uncommon acute PTSDs occur within 3 months of the traumatic event, and chronic PTSD occurs after 3 or more months and in the postponed PTSD the symptoms occur 6 months after the traumatic event. Treatment of PTSD involves biological, social and psychological therapy. One that stands the most in these types of psychological disorder is psychological one. There are different approaches for it, it can be run as an individual conversation with a psychiatrist or in a way of group therapies that indicates larger progress in behavior of people in everyday life. There are different kinds of diagnosis analysis that can be done for this type of disorders. International classification MKB-10 is primarily used for classification of sickens and cause of deaths, while DSM-V is used for diagnosis of mental disorder behavior, and it is used on global scale. Advantage of specific group therapy primarily depends on the fact that individual has a chance to verbalize feelings without the fear of being judge, without the fear of non-acceptance. With that kind of activity, the progress of the emotional state of the person in hand, comes progress. With an individual progress there is a possibility that all members of the group learn about there own patterns of that behavior, and that they can see there reactions which are going to be positive or negative. Group psychotherapy is a method that uses group members to give feedback to the individual about his behavior and his emotional state. The advantage and specificity of this type of therapy is most in the sense that an individual has the opportunity to verbalize his feelings without fear of condemnation, prejudice and disapproval. The role of a nurse on people who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder is very broad in scope. Starting from communication skills to more complex beginnings of sister care for such patients. There is a great deal of empathy, knowledge and patience for such work. The nurses have first contact with the patient and are carrying it 24 hours a day. The nurse takes data for the sister's history by talking to family members and the patient himself. A nurse is a member of a therapeutic team and has to know the psychic disorder and recognize the patient's needs that the health care aspect can accomplish.",

Stress factors in elderly have their particularity. Anxiety states in elderly can develop in response to factors that wouldn’t cause mental disorders in a young persons. The most common chronic factors in elderly are lonely dwelling, change of life conditions and financial losses, diminished capacity of self-serving, helplessness and living in dependence of other people because of somatic diseases. Among acute stress factors could be mentioned on interrupted association with relatives, moving to a new place, had planned hospitalization and surgical treatment. Clinical picture of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder in elderly has its particularity. It is characterized by impairment of emotional and will functions expressed in depressive mood, fear, anxiety assessment of future. These factors lead to forming pathological motivation of behavior, accompanied by feeling of helplessness, uncertainty in abilities. Cognitive functions are also disturbed, especially in case of comorbide organic emotionally labile disorder of vascular genesis. In such cases symptoms of both disorders enforce each other. Firstly, attentive functions are disturbed because of fixation on unreal problems, connected with anxiety apprehensions. Voluntary memory is also reduced, especially on recent events. Although mixed anxiety and depressive disorder has a mild level of severity, it is accompanied with disturbance of critical functions. It has a great influence on persons’ capacity to make decisions and on level of social functioning.",

      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation.

It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

Article provides the perspective of the possible determinants, mechanism and consequences. The etiology of depression in longterm care service is complex and multifactorial. From the psychological point of view, depression is considered as the response to difficulties in adaptation to stress connected with chronic diseases and/or institutional setting. Depression is explained as an integral element of clinical symptomatology in variety of chronic somatic diseases, specifically related to central nervous system. Depression in long-term care setting is understood as an effect of overstretched capabilities in coping with stress related to chronic disease and the stay in institution. It is also the result of pathophysiological changes related to ongoing chronic diseases. The identification and treatment of depression in institutional setting is crucial. Mood disorders have negative influence on both the course of chronic disease and efficacy of treatment, as well as the patient’s quality of life and medical expenses. Furthermore the complex etiology of depression in the group of patients with chronic diseases in institutional setting highlights the essence of the holistic approach in their diagnosis and the need of interdisciplinary approach in their treatment.",

Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed.

Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

Dies gilt gleichermaßen für Menschen mit einer subklinisch depressiven Stimmungslage wie auch für Patienten mit einer klinisch manifesten Depression. Depressive Diabetiker weisen bezüglich Morbidität und Mortalität eine deutlich schlechtere Prognose auf als nichtdepressive Diabetiker. Obwohl es effektive Behandlungsmöglichkeiten gibt, werden viele depressive Diabetiker in der klinischen Routine nicht erkannt. Ein regelmäßiges Monitoren des Wohlbefindens und Ansprechen von emotionalen Problemen und diabetesspezifischen Belastungen ist wesentlich, um eine Diagnose und die richtige Behandlung für Depressionen bei Diabetes zu identifizieren. Je nach Schwere der Depressivität und entsprechend der Zusammenhänge mit diabetesspezifischen Problemen lassen sich unterschiedliche Therapiestrategien identifizieren. Bei subklinischen oder leichten klinischen Depressionen, bei denen ein relevanter Zusammenhang zu diabetesspezifischen Problemen besteht, scheint eine Fokussierung der diabetesspezifischen Belastungen durch Schulung, Beratung oder Therapieumstellung sinnvoll. Bei diabetesunspezifischen Auslösern einer depressiven Erkrankung können bei leichteren Formen psychotherapeutische Interventionen oder Beratungen, in schweren Fällen in Kombination mit einer pharmakologischen Therapie Abhilfe schaffen. „Collaborative Care“-Ansätze, in denen eine antidepressive Therapie mit diabetesspezifischen Elementen kombiniert und im Rahmen eines „Stepped Care“-Ansatzes eskaliert werden kann, erscheint nach dem jetzigen Stand der Forschung die Therapie der Wahl bei der Komorbidität von Diabetes und Depression.",

When the individual refuses to accept medical opinion and attributes the pain to a physical illness and persistently seeks diagnosis and treatment, then there is a possibility of an unexplained somatic problem. Depression, anxiety or even a personality disorder may be causative factors. The lack of studies of this type of disorder in the prison environment makes it difficult to fully evaluate the importance of this phenomenon for primary health care consultation in prison, despite the fact that the number of presented unexplained somatic complaints may well be the same as in the community (around 15%). Management of this type of patient is always difficult, complex and emotionally demanding for the health care professional.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

Attention to categorical entities such a major depression or anxiety disorders will alert the clinician to comorbid psychiatric disorders that respond to traditional psychiatric treatments. Finally, by assessing the domains of illness behaviors such as disease conviction, beliefs in organic versus psychological causes, and denial, the clinician can document and then confront abnormal cognitive schema that revolve around somatic concerns that are a proxy for psychosocial difficulties.",

Current knowledge about biochemical and structural background of depression is wide and enough well recognized. In contrast, studies on bioelectric conditions of depressive disorders are quite poor, despite the fact that the bioelectric phenomena are--beside biochemical processes--the immanent feature of nervous cells. Currently--apart from the kindling phenomenon--there is a lack of theories or hypotheses trying to explain the origin of depression (affective disorders) with perturbation of bioelectrical functions in neurons. Certain bioelectrical phenomena accompanying the different forms of antidepressant therapy (e.g. changing in the threshold level) are recognized as accidental side effects or not possessing the clinical meaning. The analysis conducted shows a necessity of intensifying experimental and clinical investigations over explaining the usefulness of the electric phenomena in the pathomechanism of depressive disorders.",

      "abstract": "In contemporary psychology and psychiatry, scholars commonly refer to these and other consistent constellations of traits as personality disorders, especially when they are statistically extreme and tied to distress, impairment, or both.The most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), defines a personality disorder as \"an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment\" (p.645).Personality disorders present us with something of a paradox.On the one hand, many of these conditions, such as those exemplified by Theophrastus' evocative character portraits, are immediately recognizable to most or all of us.Few of us experience any difficulty recognizing marked narcissistic personality disorder traits in a flamboyant politician who talks about himself incessantly and brags at length about his accomplishments.Consistent with these anecdotal impressions, epidemiological data demonstrate that DSM-5 personality disorders are surprisingly common even in general population samples.For example, across six sites (four in the U.S., one in the U.K., and one in Norway), the median prevalence of \"any PD [personality disorder\" in the community was estimated to be 10.56% (Lenzenweger, 2008), indicating that approximately one in 10 persons in the general population meets criteria for one or more DSM personality disorders.For reasons that are not clear, the overall prevalence of personality disorders tends to be higher in North and South America than in Europe (Tyrer, Reed, & Crawford, 2015).At the same time, as we will discuss later (see the \"Trait models\"), the very concept of \"prevalence\" is of dubious relevance to personality disorders given that there is weak evidence that many, if any, of these conditions differ qualitatively from normality (Frances, 1993;",

      "abstract": "Un fenomeno frecuente y de dificil tratamiento en los pacientes psiquiatricos es el dano fisico directo e intencional causado por conductas autolesivas que no se efectuan con una finalidad suicida. La conducta se puede presentar eventualmente en padecimientos psiquiatricos como estados depresivos o psicoticos. Sin embargo, cuando se presenta de manera frecuente, constituye lo que se denomina el sindrome de autolesion deliberada que se puede observar en pacientes con retraso mental y trastornos de personalidad. Este trabajo sustenta una implicacion de las estructuras limbicas que procesan el componente cognoscitivo-afectivo del dolor en el desarrollo del comportamiento autolesivo (CAL). Proponemos que el CAL resulta de una disfuncion en la percepcion nociceptiva, particularmente en los mecanismos de alto orden de procesamiento, donde se integra el dolor como una experiencia consciente y se conceptua como sensacion desagradable. Suponemos que esta alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva puede considerarse como una consecuencia, manifestacion o sintoma, de una anomalia en la percepcion de si mismo. La alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva y en la percepcion de si mismo, resultaria, en algunos casos, de la incidencia de factores ambientales desfavorables en personas biologicamente vulnerables, mientras que en otros, seria la anomalia biologica la determinante de la conducta. Se ha encontrado una asociacion entre la incapacidad de reconocer estimulos nociceptivos y la presencia de fenomenos disociativos. Esto ejemplifica la forma en que una respuesta altamente especializada y adaptativa en sujetos sanos ante condiciones amenazantes podria originar, de manera paradojica, conductas poco adaptativas. Los sujetos expuestos de manera cronica a situaciones amenazantes en edades tempranas, son susceptibles de desarrollar un patron de respuesta patologico que podria poner en riesgo su vida.",

      "abstract": "Addiction to alcohol or any other psychoactive substance can run parallel with other diseases or mental disorders. One can then observe co-occurrence and mutual interaction of dysfunctions typical of addiction and of other mental disorders that accompany addiction. That is why, clinical pictures of such states (double diagnosis) are usually less unique, have an unusual course and cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The problem of forensic psychiatric opinion and treatment of people with a double diagnosis is another aspect of these difficulties. It is caused by the fact that forensic psychiatric assessment of the mental state of such people requires taking into consideration a very complex clinical and legal situation triggered by the interference of various ethiopathogenetic and clinical disorders. It leads to the need for complex evaluation and reference to sanity or other signs of functioning within the current law should result, first of all, from the analyses directly pertaining to the influence of the diagnosed disorders on the state of patients with double diagnosis. The forensic psychiatric aspect of disorders connected with double diagnosis is particularly significant as there is a relatively high risk of behaviours posing a threat to public order in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe article describes the diagnostical and therapeutic problems, psychiatric patients with pathological grief exhibit. The grief reactions can be divided into stress-specific reactions (typical, chronic, inhibited, and delayed grief) and non-specific and mixed reactions (distorted grief). It is especially in the latter group the diagnostical difficulties show up. The reason is, that the symptomatology in these cases is very diffuse and the clinical picture may look like many other psychiatric diseases. A case with the clinical picture of depression caused by pathological grief is discussed in relationship to other kinds of depression. Regarding psychiatric patients it is often difficult to unveil the trauma/loss. In some patients there will be more than one loss, and the problem is to find out which one has caused the symptoms. Besides, sometimes the traumatic loss is unconscious. In order to unveil the trauma we have used a combined physio-psychotherapy, which in the uncovering phase is characterized by a therapeutic non-directive attitude, where the patient is grounded, relaxed, concentrated, and as close to himself as possible in order to facilitate thoughts, emotions, body sensations etc. to emerge. When you have identified the type of loss, the therapy follows the basic principles: The inhibited emotions must be expressed and painful situations must be repeated until the emotions are extinguished. During the therapy the psychiatric patient will be in danger of becoming psychotic or committing suicide, and often it has been necessary to apply psychopharmaca to accomplish the therapy, even if many authors warn against it. The difficulties of treating hospitalized patients with pathological grief are to my opinion counterbalanced by the advantages of the in-patient psychiatric department, where you have the possibility of using various kinds of professionals, whose combined methods of treatment may ensure a successful therapy.Key Words: Pathological griefpsychotherapy",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mood disorders are common. For example, each year in the United States, 1.2 million people are diagnosed with major depressive disorder, an incidence of 5%–10%. Major depressive disorder affects at least 20% of women and 12% of men at some point in their lives. Mood disorders also are costly. For example, major depressive disorder not only is more prevalent than arthritis, diabetes, or heart disease; it also causes more emotional and physical impairment. Further, it affects patients’ health indirectly, by increasing the morbidity and mortality associated with coexisting medical conditions. A recent study of premature mortality and disability ranked major depressive disorder as the fourth leading cause of worldwide disease burden. Finally, mood disorders can be lethal; up to 15% of such patients die by suicide. Despite all of this (and despite the availability of effective treatments), mood disorders remain underrecognized and undertreated. Mood disorders resist reductionistic explanatory theories. Substantial evidence suggests that mood disorders are diseases. However, they are diseases that become intertwined with patients’ individual life stories and personalities. Adverse life events trigger or exacerbate mood disorders, and the illness may then become the major adverse event in a patient’s life. Furthermore, up to 85% of depressed patients experience multiple episodes of illness, such that it becomes increasing difficult to distinguish the “illness” from the “person.”",

Generally, mental health problems emerge as serious threats to the well-being of human society in both genders. These problems break up the peace of our mind and its stability cannot be under control. Nowadays, anxiety and its associated problems are among the most common psychiatric syndromes in all over the world. It is believed that this syndrome affects approximately 25 percent of the general population. Hence, the present study attempts to find out the major causes of depression under anxiety particularly for the women section because women are mostly having depression, which is affected by their anxiety. With the rapid growth of industrialization and modernization in the country, there is also a rapid increase in the rate of violence against women, which has directly or indirectly contributed to the rise of mental health problems. The most effective treatment is to maintain our healthy immune system through yoga, physical activities and positive thinking etc.",

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

They occur due to a complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors and are some of the most common conditions encountered in general clinical practice as well as the specialist gastroenterological clinic. The top-down regulation of visceral sensations plays an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease, i.e., the central processing of emotions and stressors altering the sensory and motor components of the gut, which increases hypersensitivity and therefore symptom severity. In addition, the core personality traits of the individual play their part in the way symptoms are perceived, further providing proof for the long-prevailing belief that the gut and emotions are linked, the so-called \"gut feeling.\" The current diagnostic criteria for FGIDs are entirely based on subjective symptoms, challenging in itself due to the varied presentations, and further complicated by the current unavailability of objective laboratory tests which could confirm its presence in the symptomatic individual. The various treatment modalities include psychotherapies ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy to mindfulness, along with appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Addressing all these underlying causes, in addition to weighing in the genetic makeup of the individual, is necessary for delineating accurate prognosis, reducing attending health-care costs, and improving overall outcome of the individual.",

      "abstract": "Psychological problems are simply aspects of human behavior—broadly defined to include ways of thinking, perceiving, feeling, and acting—that cause people distress or interfere with functioning in important areas of their lives. This straightforward and pragmatic definition of psychological problems is offered as an alternative to the current medical model view in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> and the <italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> that dominates thinking about psychological problems in most of the world today. Psychological problems are not the result of terrifying illnesses of the mind. Although they can be very distressing and problematic for individuals, they are surprisingly commonplace variations in the natural continua of psychological problems that arise in perfectly ordinary ways. This perspective has the advantages of scientific validity and reducing the stigma inherent in viewing psychological problems as mental illnesses, mental disorders, or psychopathology.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traditionally medicine had its share of patients with mental derangement or behavioral disorder, and medical texts included the careful description of these symptoms and their treatment. While in some patients these disturbances preceded the onset of other recognizable physical symptoms, were concomitant with them or subsided with recovery, in still others the mental symptoms or disordered behavior remained. In yet another group of patients mental symptoms or disordered behavior was all that a physician could discern. The situation was further complicated by the fact that there was much overlap among these groups of patients, and that relatively few patients with mental symptoms only came to the attention of physicians. After all a physician was called only when there was grave concern for a sick person and when the physician’s services could be afforded. When the physician was consulted no radically different measures of treatment were prescribed, since medical theory provided guidelines for the treatment of all diseases. In the majority of cases, mental, emotional, or behavioral changes were concomitants of many diseases, and there was no need for a special literature to address these secondary changes, or complications. People who developed mental or behavioral changes without other discernible signs of illness were not necessarily candidates for medical attention; even today we are still uncertain whether all instances of disturbed behavior represent an illness. In such cases, as in all others, the economics of the patient’s situation played an important role, and physicians were ready to interpret a variety of complaints as medical problems when the patient could afford their services.",

Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric disorders: post-stroke depression. A review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder after stroke, and also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients, which leaded to poor quality of life. A prevalence of 30% is estimated between 1 to 5 years after stroke. More than half of all cases are neither diagnosed nor treated. Objectives The aim of this paper is to review the latest updates regarding post-stroke depression and progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Methods A systematic review of the scientific and clinical literature on PSD was conducted. The review included databases such as PubMed and Cochrane, covering articles from the past 10 years. The scientific evidence obtained was analyzed and synthesized. Results Currently, the diagnosis of PSD is mainly based on the DSM guidelines and combined with various depression scales. Symptoms usually occur within the first three months after stroke, the patient presents symptoms of a depressive episode such as low mood, anhedonia, loss of appetite, sleep disorders, vegetative symptoms or social withdrawal. Several mechanisms, including biological, behavioural, and social factors, are involved in its pathogenesis. The main predictors are personal history or cognitive impairment, as well as sequelae of the stroke. Left hemispheric strokes are those with the highest risk of early depression, as well as small subcortical vessel pathology. Treatment is mainly pharmacological, with SSRIs. The probability of recovery is between 15 and 57% in the first year, with a recurrence of 38% at two years, up to 100% at 15 years. In addition, there is an increase in mortality, especially in those under 65 years of age. Conclusions There are still many unanswered questions in the treatment of PSD, such as the best time to start treatment or the effects of antidepressants on cognition and motor function, among others. Although great advance has been made by researchers, the mechanism of PSD is not completely clear. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Lay-off Survivor Sickness Syndrome is combination of different psychological and emotional disorders like anxiety, stress, depression and fear of uncertain future and other similar conditions. It arises as a result of organizational change such as implementation of change process or downsizing which is the reflection of response to external changes such as changing dynamics of economies like recession, intense competition; political situations and adaptability. Not only the victims of lay-off suffer from Lay-off Survivor Sickness but also the survivors who remain within the organization go through the same feelings. These conditions sometimes last for months or even years and demographic characteristics of survivors can also influence the duration of lay-off survivor sickness  which do not only affect the employees (Survivors) and their families but also the organizations which sometimes fail to achieve their desirable objectives through downsizing or change process.",

It is associated with an increased risk of death, not only through suicide but also from physical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. It is under-recognized and undertreated and it should be screened for in those at high-risk for depression such as those suffering from chronic physical health problems. Its aetiology is multifactorial and comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is common. Assessment of depression requires the clinician to determine the duration, symptom severity, suicide risk and functional impairment in the current episode, co-morbid diagnoses, past mood and treatment history, as well as a developmental, social and family history. Treatment is guided by illness severity, presentation and prior history and includes psychosocial interventions, medication and their combination, with antidepressant medication reserved for persistent and moderate-to-severe depression. Prevention of relapse is a priority and risk factors for this should be assessed and used to guide prophylactic drug and psychological treatment.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are often found in the practice of doctors of all specialties and cause difficulties in making a diagnosis, which is associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. Traditionally, anxiety disorders are considered within the framework of neuroses and include conditions such as adjustment disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and a number of somatoform disorders. The article gives a distinction between the concepts of “anxiety” and “anxiety disorders”. It should be noted that anxiety disorders cannot be considered in isolation from the concept of “stress”. Chronic stressful situations exacerbate or contribute to the development of somatic pathology, including neurological. The somatic manifestations of anxiety disorders are diverse and affect all organs and systems: cardialgia, tachycardia, heart rhythm disturbances, hyperventilation syndrome, abdominalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, neurodermatitis, etc. It is important to timely and correctly diagnose generalized anxiety disorder, which occurs both in isolation (borderline psychiatry) and in patients with various somatic pathologies and its main manifestation is generalized, persistent anxiety, not caused and not limited by any external circumstances, accompanied by autonomic, motor manifestations. Diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are also presented in the article. To identify and objectify symptoms of anxiety in practice, it is advisable to use special questionnaires: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Spielberger-Khanin Situational and Personal Anxiety Scale. The article presents a clinical case of a patient with anxiety disorder. The clinical picture and tactics of managing the patient are analyzed. The addition of etifoxine to therapy made it possible to stop the clinical manifestations of anxiety disorder in a short time.",

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Key foci include the prevalence of, clinical characteristics of, causes of, and risk factors for major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder/dysthymia, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder.

In thinking over my cases I have been surprised that so many have had eyestrain from causes beyond eradication or neutralization. The conditions being as they were, it was impossible to stop symptoms that were evidently due to what we call eyestrain. The causes simply could not be reached. We have looked at these conditions from every other standpoint except that of eyestrain, while it was precisely the eyestrain that mostly concerned the patient. Let us take this point of view: Eyestrain<sup>1</sup>may be defined as the local reflex, or general results of ocular effort caused by congenital or acquired defects or weaknesses of the optical or sensation-making mechanisms of the eyes, by",

This article examines the psychiatric disorders that are most often associated to sleep dysfunction as it is related in clinical practice and describes the polysomnographic findings. Patient's main complaints are related to difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (initial or middle insomnia, respectively) and poor quality of sleep. Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep. The reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency is mainly described for the depression, but has also been reported in other psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "[LOW BACK PAIN AT NEW WORKING AMBIENT IN ERA OF NEW ECONOMY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL RISK FACTORS].",
      "abstract": "Low back pain is the second most common symptom-related reason for physician visits and the first reason of working disability. Low back pain is a ubiquitous complaint, with particularly high prevalence among people in their working years (67%). For many individuals, episodes of back pain are self-limited and resolve without specific therapy. For others, however, back pain is recurrent or chronic, causing significant pain that interferes with employment and quality of life. Many occupations have been anecdotally linked to certain low back pain syndrome. However, the relationship between the work environment and the patient's symptoms, though clearly perceived by the patient to be causative, may be less certain. The injury model of an occupational disorder proposes that specific work activities are the cause of the patient's pain. The injury model for low back pain; implicating a causal connection with specific work activities, is complex and controversial. Determining whether a patient's low back pain is a consequence of his or her occupational activity, and how best to treat symptoms to maximize functionality and potential for a return to full employment capacity, can be challenging. In this systematic review which included patients/employees with low back pain, the following databases were searched: Pub Med, Embase, Medline and Web of science. The role of occupational mechanical exposure e.g. lifting as a risk factors for low back surgery has been debated for several decades. Diagnostic uncertainty exists even for those with back symptoms and well-described findings on scan, as these findings are common even in subjects without back pain, and may be unrelated to the symptoms. As an example, herniated disks can be identified in significant numbers of CT or MRI low back studies in subjects with no back pain. In further analysis, lifestyle factors and occupational psychosocial exposures will be addressed. Many physicians, including those practicing in primary care settings where back pain is most often seen, lack training and confidence in addressing workplace issues. Occupational factors that have a significant influence on the development of low back pain disorders are not only mechanical and postural order but also organisational, social and psychological. Organisational changes and physical and psychological job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistant impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). There is some evidence that catastrophizing as a stress coping strategy might lead to delayed recovery. Long-term work (sick) absence can be estimated through evaluation and observation of LBP risks and characteristics of the each individual case. An early return at workplace and to activities of daily life is urgent. To reduce LBS and its consequences, employers need to adopt a multifaced approach: concentrate on improving physical conditions as well as the psychosocial and environmental aspects of working environment. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation and occupational rehabilitation interventions (occupational reintegration) should be provided.",

Within this range fall both primary mood disorders and mood disorders secondary to the primary illness and its treatment.Treatment is complicated by difficulties with patient engagement and retention, limited clinical trial data, illness-related sensitivity to medications and alterations in drug metabolism, drug side effects, and drug interactions. Limited data are available about potentially valuable treatments such as exercise, transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine and psychedelics.

      "title": "Medical-legal issues in headache: penal and civil Italian legislation, working claims, social security, off-label prescription CLINICAL GOVERNANCE OF HEADACHE RELA T ED PROBLEMS",
      "abstract": "Primary headaches can be considered simultane- ously as symptom and disease itself, while secondary headaches are expressions of a pathological process that can be systemic or locoregional. Because of its subjective features, headache is often difficult to assess and quantify by severity, frequency and invalidity rate, and for these reasons it has often been implicated in legal controversies. Headache has seldom been considered in the criminal law, except when it represents a typical symptom of a disease whose existence can be objectively assessed (i.e. raised intracranial pressure). Therefore, in civil legislation it is not yet coded to start claiming for invalidity compensation. In particular, one of the most debated medical-legal ques- tions is represented by headaches occurring after head injury. Headache is often the principal symptom at the beginning of several toxic chronic syndromes, with many implications, especially in working claims, and, more recently, it may be referred to as one of the most frequent symptoms by victims of mobbing (i.e. psychological harassment in the workplace). The National Institute for Industrial Accident Insurance (INAIL) scales (instituted by the law 38/2000) mention the Subjective cranial trauma syndrome and give an invalidity rate evaluation. With ref- erence to other headache forms, no legislation really exists at the present time, and headache is only considered as a symptom of a certain coded disease. Requests for invalid- ity social pension and the question of off-label prescrip- tions (drug prescription for a disease, without formal indi- cation for it) are other controversial matters.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a rare condition, however its consequences might be devastating, since it affects patients’ physical function as well as psychological well-being. Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The pains are assumed to be due to locally limited epileptic discharges in areas of the cortex where the digestive tract is represented. When the neuronal discharges reach other brain formations, multisymptomatic, partial or generalized epileptic seizures occur. In such cases, therefore, the abdominal symptomatology is either a first stage or a rudiment of a more complex course of attack, and should not be considered as the expression of a particular form of epilepsy that might be termed abdominal epilepsy. Difficulties regarding differential diagnosis ensue in the case of migraine with abdominal symptomatology. The latter should be taken into account when relapsing attacks of abdominal pain, which cannot be explained gastroenterologically, persist for hours and alternate with headache. In case of doubt, a family history of migraine confirms the diagnosis.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

      "abstract": "In the course of medical practice we are confronted from time to time by peculiar seizures or nerve storms, which lack conformity with the more familiar descriptions. Some of these seizures cause great alarm to their victims, in that they seem to threaten paralysis, speechlessness, unconsciousness, or even death itself, or because they occasion profound states of instability and prostration. The appearance and sufferings of the patients during these attacks may further alarm relatives or onlookers, and even the medical man, unless he be familiar with the true nature of the seizures or fully alive to the history of the case, may be taken unawares, and feel so dubious about their purport and outcome as to be unable to give a reassuring prognosis. And yet the seizures which I have in mind are all consistent with long life and with good health at other times. Those with the more local effects may simulate or suggest organic disease of the brain ; those causing serious instability may also be wrongly attributed to cerebral vascular disease or cerebral tumour ; those which cause",

It is seen frequently in patients with anxiety and other stress-related disorders, but also in functional somatic syndromes. Mild and moderate cases do not need specific treatment, but underlying factors may need attention, e.g. anxiety or stress. Treatment of chronic cases should be focused on perpetuating factors such as catastrophising and avoidance behaviour. Cognitive therapy, with or without vestibular rehabilitation, is effective, while evidence for antidepressants is limited.",

Iskustvo koje jednoj osobi uzrokuje neposrednu, nesnosljivu bol, u druge ce izazvati tek manji osjecaj nelagode. Degenerativne promjene na kraljesnici jedne su od uzroka pojave boli, a time i pojave emocionalnih stanja poput anksioznosti i depresije. Anksiozni poremecaji su vrlo ucestali poremecaji. Postoji puno naziva koji se koriste za anksioznost kao sto su tjeskoba, zabrinutost, nervoza, napetost, osjecaj da je osoba na rubu, u stresu. Anksioznost je sastavni dio života. Depresija je vise od obicne tuge, ako se tuga pojavi bez ikakva razloga ili ako ne prestaje, ako nam je tesko raditi, družiti se, spavati, jednom rijecju vise se ne možemo veseliti životu, onda to vise nije obicna tuga, nego depresija.\nCilj ovog rada je utvrditi intenzitet boli kod pacijenata sa bolnim sindromom kraljesnice, ispitati stupanj anksioznosti i depresivnosti kod sudionika i ispitati odnos između intenziteta i kvalitete boli i emocionalnih stanja kod sudionika. \nIstraživanje je provedeno u Opcoj bolnici ˝Dr. Ivo Pedisic˝ na odjelu za fizikalnu medicinu i rehabilitaciju.

      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

      "abstract": "Depressionen im Alter können viele Ursachen haben. Eine Depression beim älteren Menschen kann als Episode einer rezidivierenden depressiven Störung auftreten, gehäuft treten aber auch chronifizierte Depressionen im Alter auf. Eine Besonderheit stellt die erstmalige depressive Episode im höheren Lebensalter dar, deren Ursache eine beginnende chronisch neurodegenerative Erkrankung sein kann. Eine Depression im Alter kann sich durch eine Vielzahl von Symptomen bemerkbar machen, und eine sorgfältige Erhebung mit Erfassung von Qualität und Quantität unter Einsatz geeigneter Skalen sollte obligat sein. Eine besondere Herausforderung für den Arzt ist die Depression im Alter im Kontext von Multimorbidität. Gehäuft kommen Schmerzsyndrome vor, in deren Kontext sich eine Depression entwickeln kann. Nicht selten werden Depressionen oder depressive Symptome im Alter ursächlich psychosozialen Belastungsfaktoren, wie dem Verlust von nahestehenden Angehörigen, zugeordnet und entsprechend als normale Reaktion oder situationsgerecht missklassifiziert. Entsprechend häufig werden adäquate Diagnostik und Therapie nur in Teilen, verspätet oder gar nicht angeboten. Die Therapie der Depression im Alter hat eine Reihe von Besonderheiten. Hinsichtlich der medikamentösen Therapie gilt, wie generell in der Altersmedizin, mit niedrigeren Dosierungen zu beginnen und rasche Aufdosierung zu vermeiden. Außerdem muss besonders auf Wechselwirkungen geachtet, und anticholinerge Substanzen müssen gemieden werden. Zunehmende Bedeutung gewinnt auch im ambulanten Bereich die altersspezifische, verhaltensorientierte Psychotherapie, die als Gruppentherapie und zusätzlich als Einzelpsychotherapie erfolgen kann. Besonders im Konzept der tagesklinischen Behandlung lassen sich die Grundbausteine der medikamentösen und psychotherapeutischen Behandlung mit ergotherapeutischer Intervention, Bewegungstherapie, Entspannungsverfahren und Psychoedukation ergänzen. Zusammenfassend stehen eine Vielzahl von Therapiemöglichkeiten zur Auswahl, die nachhaltigen Therapieerfolg versprechen und erheblich zur Steigerung der Lebensqualität im Alter beitragen können.",

      "title": "The effect of stress on the sportsman’s body and training activities",
      "abstract": "In the modern conditions of the development of sports, a great place is given to the impact of stress on the athlete's body. During preparation for competitions of various levels, the Olympic Games, world championships, continental championships, city competitions, athletes are \"accompanied\" by mental and emotional tension. Accordingly, when being in a given state of stress, corresponding negative disturbances appear in the performed sports activity. In general, stress is a fairly common and common phenomenon. Minor stresses are inevitable and harmless, but excessive stress creates problems for both individuals and organizations in accomplishing tasks. Psychologists believe that a person suffers more and more often from insults inflicted on him, a sense of his own insecurity, uncertainty about the future. There are two main groups of stress factors that most significantly affect the results of sports activities and are most often encountered: pre-competitive and competitive. Competitive stressors are stressors related directly to the sporting situation the athlete finds themselves in. Essentially, they are the most obvious stressors and are most directly linked to what happens during training or in a game. Organizational stressors can be attributed to, and therefore solved by, the coaching and organizational set up surrounding a team. The athlete needs to be helped to identify actions aimed at improving performance. Success in reaching sports peaks depends on the individual psychological characteristics of the athlete, and certain types of sports make demands and at the same time form personal qualities that are necessary for successful competitive activities. Each athlete is different, and their response to these competitive stressors will vary too. Finding the sweet spot where these stressors are contributing to an engaged, locked-in mindset can be the difference come crunch time. Knowing when a competitive stressor is overwhelming an athlete and having a detrimental affect can be an important preventative measure to avoid further issues down the road.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

The content of delusions varies from patient to patient, and this content may or may not be congruent with the individual's mood. The delusions of individuals with dementia are most often paranoid or persecutory; they are also simple, as a high level of cognitive functioning seems to be required in order to elaborate complex delusions.

      "title": "Stress-Related Immune Markers in Depression: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Major depression is a serious psychiatric disorder; however, the precise biological basis of depression still remains elusive. A large body of evidence implicates a dysregulated endocrine and inflammatory response system in the pathogenesis of depression. Despite this, given the heterogeneity of depression, not all depressed patients exhibit dysregulation of the inflammatory and endocrine systems. Evidence suggests that inflammation is associated with depression in certain subgroups of patients and that those who have experienced stressful life events such as childhood trauma or bereavement may be at greater risk of developing depression. Consequently, prolonged exposure to stress is thought to be a key trigger for the onset of a depressive episode. This review assesses the relationship between stress and the immune system, with a particular interest in the mechanisms by which stress impacts immune function, and how altered immune functioning, in turn, may lead to a feed forward cascade of multiple systems dysregulation and the subsequent manifestation of depressive symptomology. The identification of stress-related immune markers and potential avenues for advances in therapeutic intervention is vital. Changes in specific biological markers may be used to characterize or differentiate depressive subtypes or specific symptoms and may predict treatment response, in turn facilitating a more effective, targeted, and fast-acting approach to treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Clinical practitioners commonly see patients with pain and other somatic symptoms that they cannot adequately explain on the basis of the degree of damage or inflammation noted in peripheral tissues. In fact, this may be among the most common predicament that individuals seek medical attention for (1). Typically, an evaluation is performed looking for a \"cause\" for the pain. If none is found, these individuals are often given a diagnostic label that merely connotes that the patient has chronic pain in a region of the body, without an underlying mechanistic cause [e.g., chronic low back pain, headache, temporomandibular disorder (TMD), etc.]. In other cases, the label given alludes to an underlying mechanism that may or may not be responsible for the individual's pain (e.g., \"facet syndrome\").",

      "abstract": "Demoralization may be viewed as a combination of distress and subjective incompetence. The main problem in demoralization is the sense of incompetence experienced by the demoralized individual; this sense of incompetence results from uncertainty as to the appropriate direction of action. By contrast, the major difficulty in endogenomorphic depression is a decreased magnitude of motivation even when the appropriate direction of action is known. This distinction is important not only because demoralization appears to be a major public health problem, but also because subjective incompetence appears to influence the course and worsen the prognosis of both nonpsychiatric and psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the increasing worldwide prevalence of chronic pain may be as high as 20-50 %. Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

Parmi ces facteurs, il faut souligner l’importance des plaintes somatiques, des troubles cognitifs et des troubles anxieux. Enfin, si la depression ne fait pas partie du processus normal de vieillissement, vieillir s’accompagne de situations favorisant sa survenue comme, en particulier, le deuil.

      "title": "Treatment-Resistant Depression in Late Life",
      "abstract": "Depression is the most prevalent functional psychiatric disorder in late life. It is associated with a high risk of mortality from comorbid medical illness and from suicide. Successful antidepressant treatment is one of the most effective ways to reduce disability, prevent morbidity, and improve quality of life in an older depressed patient. Treatment-resistant depression is a common clinical problem, reported to affect up to one-third of older depressed patients. However, published data on this clinically important topic are sparse. Available data and clinical experience indicate that many depressed patients labeled as “treatment resistant” or even “treatment refractory” are so labeled because of variables involving the diagnostic or treatment process, rather than because they suffer from a depression that is truly unresponsive to treatment. Unidentified comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions and misdiagnosis often contribute to treatment resistance. Atypical depressive symptoms, such as somatic and cognitive symptoms, and comorbid medical conditions that can themselves produce depressive symptoms often make it difficult to accurately assess antidepressant response in this age group. This often leads to inadequate pharmacotherapy, another major factor contributing to apparent treatment resistance. In older patients, as in younger patients, the selection of the right antidepressant, the right dose, and the right treatment duration constitute the treatment variables essential in ensuring optimal therapeutic response. Approach to treatment-resistant depression in the elderly involves reconsideration of the diagnosis and use of alternate therapeutic measures in a systematic way, including switching to another agent, combination therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

      "abstract": "Living with end stage organ failure and transplantation has implications for physiological, psychological, and social well-being. The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "KUGATHASANDepression is a widespread illness that affects people regardless of age, nationality, race, and gender.Nearly everyone has feelings of blue moods at some point in their lives.It is when these feelings persist, recur, or become severe that one may be experiencing depression and should seek medical help.People with a depressive illness cannot merely \"pull themselves together\" and get better.Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years and it can be debilitating.Fortunately, today, there is a wide range of medications and therapies available to treat depression.A complex interplay of factors involving genetics, stress, and changes in body and brain function are thought to play a role in the development of depression (Kaufman, 2001).One of the reasons that depression is so common is because the illness may develop for a variety of reasons.A recent study suggests that abnormalities of the hippocampus may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression (Posener et al, 2003).The exact causes of depression are still in question, but scientists have identified certain risk factors that could increase the likelihood of one becoming depressed Family history of depression, stressful situations such as a death in the family or relationship troubles, dependence on alcohol or drugs, medical conditions such as diabetes or cancer, and other mental illnesses are all risk factors that could lead to depression.Depression can take many forms.What differentiates these forms are the severity and duration of the symptoms.However, there often is not a clear distinction between these different types of depression, since they frequently share many of the same characteristics.The different types of depression can be classified as minor depression or dysthymia, major depression, and manic depression (bipolar disorder), and within each of these main categories there are several subtypes.Major depression, sometimes called clinical depression, is the most common form of depression.It is characterized by a mood change that lasts more than two weeks and includes one or both primary signs of depression: overwhelming feelings of sadness or grief, and loss of interest or pleasure in usually enjoyable activities (Kaufman, 2001).People with major depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, feelings of worthlessness, impaired thinking or concentration, insomnia, feeling tired all the time, significant weight loss or gain.These symptoms may differ from person to person as well as from one depressive episode to the next.For example, some people may have insomnia and lose weight while depressed, whereas others may oversleep, overeat and gain weight (Madison Institute of Medicine).In addition, major depression can range from mild to severe, with varying intensity of symptoms.In extreme cases, people with severe depression may be unable to work or care for themselves.Although major depression is the most common form of depression, approximately 26 per cent of individuals with major depression also suffer from chronic minor depression or dsythymia (Harkness et al, 2002).Dysthymia is a long-lasting form of mild depression characterized by a persistently gloomy outlook.Dysthymia generally lasts for at least two years and sometimes more than five years (Mayclinic.com).It usually isn't as disabling as major depression and periods of dysthymia may alternate with intervals of feeling normal.Signs and symptoms of dysthymia are like those of major depression but not as intense (Rapaport et al, 2002).",

Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

      "abstract": "Human emotions play an important role in everyone's daily life. People who have good emotional health pose to have good health. However, many things that happen in our life can disrupt our emotional health. These can lead to strong feelings of sadness, stress, or anxiety. In today's world many things that happen in our life can disrupt our emotional health. Emotions are also associated with problematic changes in the cardiovascular, hormonal and immune system that may lead to allergies, headache, migraine, Arthritis, blood pressure, diabetes and may penetrate its way to the heart which gives you heart attacks. In fact, recent studies show, for over 40 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with depression, the number of people coping (or trying to cope) with loneliness is unknown, and that feeling of not belonging is depressing all by itself. Emotions like anger, fear, Disgust triggers strong sensations in the upper body. Other emotions like depression, sadness and shame shows diminished sensation in the lower body, while some emotions combined both type of response. Though emptions are created in the brain, they can be manifest as physical feelings throughout the body. The most common way to understand human emotion is by capturing and understand signals provided by the human body. With help of IoT, NLP, Machine learning, Social Analytics and Artificial Intelligence we can capture and understand physiological signals and develop an emotion recognition system based on information provided by physiological signals.",

      "title": "Die Rolle Der Psychotherapie Beim Reizdarmsyndrom",
      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that greatly impacts on quality of life due to gastrointestinal complaints such as pain or altered stool habits. Based on the biopsychosocial model the severity of the disease is affected by the combination of physiological processes, social aspects and psychological factors. While treatment approaches mainly focused on the reduction of gut complaints by dietary means or medication, psychotherapy is becoming an alternative or additional approach with very good evidence, especially in light of associated psychiatric comorbidities (e. g. depression, anxiety disorder). Often psychiatric symptoms/comorbidities increase the probability of a complicated course of the disease with a reciprocal interaction of gut complaints and psychiatric symptoms. Behavioral therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, mindfulness interventions and other psychotherapeutic methods are used to increase coping as well as disease control and to restructure dysregulated cognitive processes. The current review focuses on psychosocial aspects of the irritable bowel syndrome and discusses the benefit of psychotherapeutic interventions.Das Reizdarmsyndrom ist eine häufige funktionelle gastrointestinale Störung, die aufgrund wiederkehrender gastrointestinaler Beschwerden wie Bauchschmerzen oder Stuhlveränderungen die Lebensqualität erheblich beeinträchtigen kann. Basierend auf dem biopsychosozialen Krankheitsmodell wird die Ausprägung des Reizdarmsyndroms durch die Kombination von veränderten physiologischen Prozessen, sozialen Aspekten und psychischen Faktoren beeinflusst. Während der Fokus bisher auf der Linderung der Darmbeschwerden mittels Diät sowie medikamentöser Therapie lag, stellen Psychotherapieverfahren angesichts der starken Assoziation mit psychischen Komorbiditäten (u. a. Depression, Angststörung) zunehmend alternative oder ergänzende Behandlungsmethoden mit mittlerweile sehr guter Evidenz dar. Grundsätzlich können zusätzliche psychische Begleitsymptome die Wahrscheinlichkeit komplizierter Krankheitsverläufe erhöhen, wobei sich psychische Symptome und Darmbeschwerden maßgeblich gegenseitig beeinflussen. Mithilfe von kognitiver Verhaltenstherapie, psychodynamischer Psychotherapie, Hypnotherapie, achtsamkeitsbasierter Therapie und anderen psychotherapeutischen Verfahren sollen die Krankheitsbewältigung und -kontrolle gesteigert und fehlregulierte kognitive Prozesse umstrukturiert werden. In dieser Übersichtsarbeit fokussieren wir uns auf den psychosozialen Aspekt des Reizdarmsyndroms und diskutieren den Nutzen der psychotherapeutischen Verfahren.",

      "abstract": "Somatization implies a tendency to experience and communicate psychological distress in the form of somatic symptoms and to seek medical help for them. So defined, it is neither a disorder nor a diagnostic category but a generic term for a set of experiential, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of patients who complain of physical symptoms in the absence of relevant medical findings. Such patients are ubiquitous in all medical care settings, pose difficult diagnostic and management problems, and overutilize health care thus contributing to its cost. Somatization may be transient or persistent, and may or may not be associated with a diagnosable medical or psychiatric disorder. The most common concurrence of somatization is with affective and anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, the somatoform disorders. Persistent somatization poses a serious clinical, social, and economic problem and hence early identification of potential chronic somatizers should be attempted to avoid its development. Pain, fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea are the commonest symptoms. Etiology of somatization is multifactorial and so should be its management.",

Loss of motivation due to disturbance of intellect, emotion, or level of consciousness defines the symptom of apathy.

According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process.

      "title": "Relationship between stress and pain in work‐related upper extremity disorders: The hidden role of chronic multisymptom illnesses*",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Pain and fatigue are commonly associated with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Occasionally these symptoms persist beyond a reasonable healing period. One potential explanation for prolonged symptom expression is the concurrent development of a stress‐mediated illness or CMI (Chronic Multi‐Symptom Illness). In such a scenario, the chronic regional pain and other symptoms that the individual is experiencing would be attributable to the CMI rather than to tissue damage or a biomechanical dysfunction of the upper‐extremity. Methods This article critically reviews the case definitions of the new class of CMI disorders and evaluates the existing evidence supporting centrally mediated physiological changes (e.g., sensory hypervigilance, dysautonomia) that manifest as symptoms of pain and fatigue in some individuals experiencing chronic stressors. Results While explanations for prolonged pain and fatigue have historically focused on mechanisms involving peripheral pathology or psychiatric explanations, ample evidences support the role of altered Central Nervous System function in accounting for symptom manifestation in CMI. Conclusions A model is presented that unites seemingly disparate findings across numerous investigations and provides a framework for understanding how genetics, triggering events, stressors, and early life events can affect CNS activity. Resultant symptom expression (e.g., pain and fatigue) from central dysregulation would be expected to occur in a subset of individuals in the population, including a subset of individuals with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Thus when symptoms such as pain and fatigue persist beyond a reasonable period, consideration of CMI and associated assessment and interventions focused on central mechanisms may be worthwhile. Am.

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

Otherwise it could represent the steady postprocessual shifts devoid of any signs of progressive course, or be a manifestation of either the protracted initial stage of a future attack or slow development of remission. Related to this, the clinical features of the affective disorders are variable and primarily dependent on the regularities of the underlying schizophrenic process. As the affective phases alternated and negative changes varied in strength, patients having different affective disorders attained different levels of social and labor adaptation.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain: What Does It Mean? A Review on the Use of the Term Chronic Pain in Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Chronic pain is nowadays used as an umbrella term referring to a wide range of clinical conditions, such as fibromyalgia, migraine, or long-standing pain states without actual known causes. However, labeling a patient's clinical condition with the term \"chronic pain\", when dealing with pain lasting longer than 3 months, might be misleading. This paper aims at analyzing the possible pitfalls related to the use of the term \"chronic pain\" in the clinical field. It appears, indeed, that the term \"chronic pain\" shows a semantic inaccuracy on the basis of emerging scientific evidences on the pathogenesis of different long-standing pain states. The major pitfalls in using this label emerge in clinical settings, especially with patients having a biomedical perspective on pain or from different cultures, or with healthcare providers of other medical specialties or different disciplines. A label solely emphasizing temporal features does not help to discern the multifaceted complexity of long-standing pain states, whose onset, maintenance and exacerbation are influenced by a complex and interdependent set of bio-psycho-social factors. Thus, finding a more meaningful name might be important. We call upon the necessity of bringing awareness and implementing educational activities for healthcare providers, as well as for the public, on the biopsychosocial approach to assess, prevent and care of chronic pain. Further research on the etiopathogenetic processes of chronic pain states is also required, together with examinative diagnostic methods, to individuate the most appropriate label(s) representing the complex long-standing pain states and to avoid adopting the term \"chronic pain\" inappropriately.

Disorders of the nervous system can ruin the lives of individuals and are of such a magnitude that they create many of our greatest social problems. People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Jeongji[Mental] disorder refers to a series of diseases that has a close link between the attack, clinical presentation and emotional stimulation. The attack is deeply affected by emotional stimulation, with which physical symptoms are either present or absent. However, emotional changes are clear most of the time, their effect on disease development noticeable as well. To sum up, Jeongji[Mental] disorder is related to a wide range of medical problems in fields such as internal, surgical, gynecology, pediatrics, and various psychiatric disorders, not to mention contemporary psychological disorders, neurosis, and all kinds of mental illnesses of today. Moreover, the mental and physical disorders of today all share a common pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment discipline. All the more reason for deeper professional research.",

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

      "abstract": "Pain is, according to the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain, an unpleasant, sensory and emotional experience connected to real or possible tissue damage or descriptively in terms of damage. Pain is the most expressed symptom of every clinical picture of oral cavity disease and the reason for the patient to contact his dentist. The feeling of pain is individual, difficult to compare and measure. Depending on the time of its occurence, pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is fast and sharp, it occurs during stimulus application or immediately after the stimulus has been removed. Chronic pain is dull, slow, it appears intermittently or continually, it can be dependent on the stimulus or spontaneous. It presents more character variations than the acute pain. Such patients often come to the dentist's office, complaining about the pain which is not present at that moment. This makes diagnostics harder and widens the spectrum of pathological changes which may cause such pain. Various dental surgeries can cause painful sensations of different character, intensities and duration. It is necessary to diagnose painful sensations and to remove the cause. Prosthetic therapy can cause physical pain in many clinical phases, however, physical pain is also connected to prosthetic rehabilitation due to disrupted chewing, phonetic and aesthetic function which is ensured by a healthy and sanitized stomatognathic system. The fear of uncertainty of functioning and aesthetics without prosthetic work during the therapy implementation and the fear and uncertainty of the new prosthetic work has great effect on the patient's behaviour. The 'new' smile changes the patient's facial appearance. One becomes aware of that and engages himself in conversation with others more confidently. Properly performed prosthetic therapy raises self-confidence of a patient and can open up new opportunities in life. This is achieved by a therapist who can correctly and individually indicate prosthetic work and recognize the personality of a patient and thus adapt the way of communication during therapy. A dentist should not fear painful sensations that a patient complains about, but using his knowledge make the correct diagnosis, recognise his possible mistake at work and as fast and as more efficiently as possible reduce the feeling of pain.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic illness is a clinical concept used to define medically unexplained somatic symptoms considered to express psychological distress. Functional somatic illness may express underlying psychiatric disorders (e.g. fibromyalgia due to non-fearful panic disorder, irritable bowel syndrome due to bipolar disorder). Sustained physiological activation caused by stressful life events combined with catastrophic thinking may be another cause. Functional somatic illness may also be caused by classic conditioning of physiological responses that may have been triggered by biological or emotional stimuli. Operant conditioning may also be a cause. The therapeutic alliance relies on acceptance of the reality of the subjective complaints, without a priori acceptance of the patient's attribution of the cause of the symptoms. We recommend initial exploration of the patient's own ideas about aetiology, including appropriate medical tests. The physician should then change the agenda to a biopsychosocial perspective and identify current stressors and psychosocial variables that reinforce symptoms. Only a few randomised trials have been performed. They suggest that psychological treatment should be systematic and structured, with a focus on information, alternative ways of perception, and problem solving. Active forms of physiotherapy and psychopharmacological drugs may be of some benefit in selected patients.",

Depression (or any non-normative health issue), I have come to realise, is not something that can be talked about objectively. It’s an individual experience which has complete relevance to the person who has gone through it. Thus, what this all equals to – is a problem with defining depression as an illness, particularly when considering the undoubtedly horrifying history of how psychiatric patients have been treated, ultimately because of their “diagnoses”.",

The pattern of losses experienced in old age differs from that encountered earlier in life; notably, increasingly prevalent physical illness and brain changes may cause psychological stress additional to their neurophysiological impact. DSM-IV diagnostic decisions have proved relatively unhelpful when planning interventions in cases of late-life unipolar depression. Relapse following remission is common, especially if culpable factors (e.g. vascular change or persisting effects of losses) remain in evidence. Understanding how different factors have contributed to diminution of self-esteem, as well as biological depressive features, allows planning of appropriate therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

      "title": "The complex conundrum of geriatric depression and dementias",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

      "abstract": "While pain has traditionally been understood within a medical model that equates pain to tissue damage or disease, this understanding is not consistent with everyday observations of pain or with clinical examples of persistent pain where there is often very little correlation between pain experienced and physical findings. This article considers psychological and multidimensional theories of pain, which are described within the historical context within which they were developed, including behavioural, cognitive, contextual and functional theories. Research into the multifactorial nature of persistent pain has tended to focus on mechanisms of pain development and maintenance or on the function of pain. Psychological approaches, which have focused on mechanism traditionally use disability, mood and quality of life measures to assess outcome, claiming little or no impact on pain intensity itself. By contrast, functional approaches include an explicit goal of reducing pain intensity, which is therefore measured as a key treatment outcome. Strong evidence exists from a range of sources of the important contribution of psychological and social factors to the experience of pain. However, evidence is still lacking about the specific mechanisms of change that are targeted by biopsychosocial interventions and about what treatment approach is likely to work best for whom.",

Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner.

Remission implies that the signs and symptoms of the disease are absent or virtually absent, which is typically associated with a return to the patient s previous daily functioning. Functioning in depression is a broad concept that covers different domains. There are many validated instruments for its assessment, these being reviewed in this article. Furthermore, recovering the pre-morbid level of functioning level is increasingly being identified as a significant target in addition to symptomatic remission. In this sense, functional recovery has been associated with better prognosis of depression and is also a clinical goal expressed by the patient. Several factors, like complete remission of symptoms, with no residual symptoms, maintenance of remission, quality of remission, early remission, have been identified as contributors to functional recovery. In order to facilitate the clinical outcomes, evaluation of and search for symptomatic remission as well as functional recovery need to be integrated into the clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

      "title": "STRESS AND HEART",
      "abstract": "Background : Human beings throughout the world are faced with high and ever increasing levels of acute or chronic stress. Acute stress is defined as “the normal short-term physiological response to the perception of major threat or demands”. Chronic stress is defined as “the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of irresolvable major threats or demands”. 1 In fact, all these modern definitions of stress date back to the time of Hans Selye, the first scientist who studied the effects of stress on health and physiological integrity of living organisms. 2 Accordingly, the term stress pertains to effects of all environmental and psychosocial factors on physical or mental well-being. 1 The effect of stress on cardiovascular system has bean discussed for many years, 3 although until recently, the evidence has been relatively weak due to the complexity of such a relationship. 4 Among the many different types of stressors, mental and psychosocial stressors exert profound effects on the circulatory system. Primary studies on the relationship of stress with cardiovascular disease focused mainly on type A personality, then shifting to more specific components, i.e. hostility and anger, as stressful factors that provoke cardiovascular problems. 5 Behavioral or psychosocial stress induces or influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect. Psychosocial stress has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress which disturbs endothelial integrity and induces endothelial injury and dysfunction. 6 These processes activate beta 1-adrenoceptors that cause sympathoadrenal activation, which in turn enhances atherosclerosis. Also, behavioral or psychosocial stressors decrease estrogen, which may be of importance for the development of premenopausal atherosclerosis. 7 (1) HamidReza Roohafza MD. Psychiatrist,  Mental Health Research Unit, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. Email: roohafza@crc.mui.ac.ir Stress is strongly associated with CAD. Clinically, mental stress is a cause of angina and may specifically worsen CAD. By provoking a dynamic decrease in coronary supply, mental stress may activate the ischemic response and induce substantial myocardial ischemia, and in the long term adversely affect prognosis in CAD patients. 8,9 Hostility and anger have also been shown to negatively influence ejection fraction and myocardial blood circulation, pointing out the importance of these phenomena as the etiology of CAD. 5 However, other forms of stress also have an impact. Behavioral/ psychosocial stress may participate in the development of CAD, via neuroendocrine mediation through sympathoadrenal activation (chronic sympathetic hyperarousal), seen clinically in angina/chest pain associated with normal coronary angiograms. 10 Stress clearly has the potential to actively trigger threatening cardiac events that lead to myocardial infarction. Mental stress increases the myocardial oxygen demand via sympathoadrenal activation and also involves a reduction in the myocardial oxygen supply, an eventually fatal consequence. 11 Mental stress obviously has a profound impact on long-term cardiac events and outcome. In particular, mental stress may cause paradoxical constrictions in patients with CAD/atherosclerosis, especially at points of stenosis - a response that correlates with the extent of atherosclerosis (plaque) and with the endothelium-dependent response to an infusion of acetylcholine (verification of endothelial dysfunction). 12 Discussion : Stress contributes to the onset, development, progression, and treatment delay of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of stress is high in both developing and developed countries, 13 an example of which is a large multicomponent interventional project on lifestyle habits performed in Iran, named Isfahan Healthy Heart Program, the results of which show high stress levels in 40% of men and 45% of women. 14 Thus, ‘lifestyle’ needs to be a central focus of prevention, 13 as this ‘epidemic of stress’ 1 may turn into a critical medical issue. Stress management interventions such as cognitive behavioral strategies to improve adaptive methods, and the use of relaxation response techniques are of growing importance in the future. 14",

      "abstract": "T he devastating impact that psychiatric illness can have on people's lives is beyond dispute. It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct. The very notion of compensating people whose suffering derives from their reaction to the injuring of others often evokes surprise, indignation and disdain.",

Furthermore, longitudinal studies indicate that complaints of disturbed sleep (in the absence of depression) at baseline are associated with an increased risk of depression at follow-up. Insomnia is often considered one of the most distressing symptoms by people experiencing depression, and is known to be associated with reduced quality of life, and increased risk of recurrence and suicide. Insomnia can be a troublesome and persistent residual symptom following treatment with antidepressants or cognitive behaviour therapy, and is often difficult to treat.",

      "abstract": "Somatization is defined as the process whereby physical symptoms are experienced in response to stress (Lipowski 1988). Examples include a tension headache or a gastrointestinal symptom (such as abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea) that is triggered or exacerbated by a stressful event (such as a school test or a family argument). The most frequently reported symptoms experienced via somatization are pain, gastrointestinal and/or neurological. It is important to recognize that an underlying illness or injury can itself be a significant stressor that triggers or exacerbates somatization. For example, a child with epilepsy might also have non-epileptic seizures, or a child with cancer might get nauseated in anticipation of a hospital admission for chemotherapy.Somatization is not intentional; it is an automatic or habitual physical and behavioral response to stress. While it is possible with training and practice to gain some control over one’s symptoms, somatization is not equivalent to falsifying symptoms (as one might see in malingering or a factitious disorder). Therefore, to simply suggest that one cease somatizing is not helpful.",

The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

It was noticed that in depression past achievements appeared to be foreign to the patients. This was described in among other terms as \"emotionally empty judgments\". Analyzing the clinical picture of hypomanic states, stress was placed on the notion of the coexistence of logical thinking (and in some cases these thinking patterns are concerned with a feeling of heightened cognitive ability) with thinking styles based on logical errors.

Recognition and measurement of depression is challenging because of the overlap with negative symptoms, but depression can be distinguished from negative symptoms by the clinician, either by using key questions or by the use of specific rating scales. Treatment is best determined after consideration of a differential diagnosis. As with the treatment of other comorbid syndromes there is limited evidence from randomized controlled studies. Treatment options for a post psychotic depression include the standard treatments for depression such as antidepressants and perhaps cognitive therapy. There is some evidence to suggest that second generation antipsychotic medication may have a better impact on depression when compared with traditional ones. Recognition and treatment of depression is an important part of any strategy to reduce suicide and attempted suicide in this high-risk population.",

Major psychological issues that arise in the treatment of depression are also discussed here. Successful treatment of depression is a collaborative effort involving patient, family, clinician (and associates). Faith is needed, and so persuasion and the support of others surrounding the patient can have greater influence on treatment outcome than does the particular choice of pharmaceuticals or psychotherapeutic method.",

It is believed to be of psychological origin but may involve both cerebral and peripheral physiological mechanisms. It is often associated with depression. Its assessment and management need to be multifactorial, i.e., medical, psychosocial and psychiatric.A thorough initial medical assessment is crucially important in order to identify any organic contributory factors and to gain the patient's trust. It is also essential to carry out a psychosocial and psychiatric assessment so as to evaluate the role of psychological and socioeconomic factors and establish whether a diagnosable psychiatric disorder is present. The latter is most likely to be a depressive, anxiety, or somatoform disorder.If the medical assessment fails to come up with a plausible organic explanation for the patient's pain, he or she should be told so clearly. The patient should be told that the goal of the treatment is not to cure the pain but to help him/her improve his/her functioning and sense of control over pain and life generally. The type of management most likely to succeed in this goal is one that is multifactorial and comprehensive rather than focused on one treatment modality only.Key Words: painsomatizationhysteria",

Depression, the most common mood disorder affecting TBI survivors, most likely is underdiagnosed and presents differently than primary depression or depression after other brain insults. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "Paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of recovery",
      "abstract": "Bell’s palsy (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy of the facial nerve) is an acute, usually unilateral paralysis of facial muscles. This disorder had been described and studied by Sir Charles Bell in 1836. In majority of Bell’s palsy cases the patient achieves full spontaneous recovery within 3-5 weeks even without treatment. In about 15-30% of cases the recovery takes considerably longer time (3 to 6 months, sometimes longer) and is usually incomplete. After the incomplete recovery of Bell’s palsy some residuals and complications usually develop. Those can include weakness of facial muscles, facial asymmetry in both neutral expression and with facial movements, pathological synkinesis, contractures of facial muscles, crocodile tears, facial pains etc.\r\n The above-mentioned complications may result in disfigured face with various degrees of severity, involuntary facial movements during speech and emotions, facial pains that are difficult to relieve with pain-killers, inability to adequately express emotions. All the named manifestations can have a dramatic impact on individual’s self-esteem, social contacts and general quality of life. They may lead to stress, depression, self-isolation and in some extreme cases – to suicidal behavior.\r\nCustomary treatment for acute Bell’s palsy include prednisone, antiviral medications, eye care to prevent drying of the cornea, mime-therapy (neuromuscular retraining). Sometimes acupuncture, chiropractors, laser therapy or high doses of B-vitamins are used. In some countries such controversial interventions as electrical stimulation (shocks) and massage with ice-cubes are being used as treatment modalities for acute Bell’s palsy. If the facial condition does not considerably improve within the first year, then the choice of treatments for residuals and complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy is rather limited. It includes continuation of mime-therapy, periodic injections of botulinum toxin, and in some exceptional cases surgical interventions (nerve graft, muscle transposition etc.) Facial nerve decompression has not been proven to be effective as Bell’s palsy treatment and therefore is nowadays seldom used. Long-standing Bell’s palsy patients are left with very limited choice of treatments for their residuals and complications. In the medical world and among rehabilitation specialists it is considered that if Bell’s palsy had not recovered within first 1-2 years and if complications had formed, then the patient will retain the developed synkinesis, contractures, related facial pains and other manifestations for the rest of his or her life.\r\nIn the recent years there has not been much research done of the underlying causes for the complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy. Without thorough understanding of such causes it is rather challenging to compose proper rehabilitation programs that deliver the desired improvements in facial symmetry and respectively, in patient’s quality of life.\r\nIn this article we discuss the traditional approach to possible causes, available treatments of Bell’s palsy complications and share our concept of a new paradigm in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of the recovery (2 years and more). According to this new paradigm, synkinesis, contractures and mass movements of facial muscles, as well as related chronic facial pains are the result of newly-formed, pathological mimetic patterns in the CNS, which can be reduced and then reversed by applying the new approach to rehabilitation, based on other than traditional principles. The results achieved by our patients can serve as an evidence that this new approach may indicate a beginning of a paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy.",

Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Emergencies",
      "abstract": "By dictionary definition, an emergency is any sudden state of affairs which demands immediate action. In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

      "title": "Exercise for depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common clinical condition, affecting over 120 million people worldwide. People experience pervasive, sustained feelings of sadness and hopelessness, persistent loss of interest, enjoyment and motivation as well as disruptions in areas such as appetite, sleep, concentration and energy levels. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and produces a greater decrement in health than chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and angina. Conventional treatments centre largely on pharmacological and psychological strategies, either on their own or in combination; but these are not acceptable to everyone. Antidepressant treatment can be complicated by side effects and drug interactions, and psychological therapies require motivation from the participant. Patients may also reject both antidepressants and psychological therapy because of perceived stigma. For several decades, exercise has been investigated as an alternative therapy for depression and several mechanisms have been proposed for its potential efficacy. It may provide distraction from negative thoughts or enhance a sense of self-efficacy through mastering a new skill. Social contact through exercise may also have a positive impact on mood and, from a more biological perspective, changes to circulating monoamines or endorphins, or reductions in the stress hormone cortisol, may also play a role. This review set out to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials of the effect of exercise in people with depression. We included studies comparing exercise with no treatment, as well as those that compared exercise with psychological or antidepressant approaches. The current version updates the earlier Cochrane Review, first published in 2009. We included trials of adults with a diagnosis of depression as defined by the original researchers. In assessing the intervention, we were guided by the American College of Sports Medicine definition of exercise as \"planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness\". We identified 39 trials, recruiting approximately 2300 participants, drawn from a variety of sources including inpatient and outpatient populations, as well as from the general public by media advertising. A diagnosis of depression was made either by structured diagnostic interview or through the use of rating scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The included trials varied widely with respect to the type of exercise, as well as its duration and frequency or the overall \"dose\" of exercise. Of the 39 trials, 32 provided aerobic exercise such as running, cycling, walking or dance; with 4 providing muscle-strengthening resistance training. Other trials provided a combination of aerobic and resistance training. There were further differences with respect to whether exercise was conducted alone or in groups, indoors or outdoors, supervised or unsupervised. Our main finding was that when compared to a control intervention, there was a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as when we analysed the six trials that were considered high quality, the effect size was clinically small and not statistically significant. A series of subgroup analyses suggested that a larger number of exercise sessions may have a greater clinical effect on mood and that resistance training or a mixture of aerobic and resistance training may be more efficacious than aerobic training alone. When exercise was compared with antidepressant medication, there was no statistical difference between the two interventions. Likewise for psychological therapy, our findings revealed no difference between this and an exercise intervention. The nature and extent to which exercise may have an effect on mood remains uncertain. Most included trials were small and many had methodological weaknesses. One inherent difficulty in these studies is that it is not possible to blind participants allocated to exercise. A further potential source of bias is that outcome measures for depression are often gathered from self-rated scales of depression, completed by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. The evidence in this review would be strengthened by further large-scale, high-quality studies, where all participants are diagnosed with depression through structured clinical interview and receive exercise as a stand-alone intervention. Further research comparing exercise with either anti depressant medication or psychological therapies, would also help resolve uncertainties about the choice between these options.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders often develop after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); the most frequent of them are depression and depression-related disorders (anxiety, apathy, pathological fatigue, posttraumatic stress disorder, etc.). Both biological and psychological mechanisms may underlie the development of these disorders. Depression and depression-related disorders decrease patients' quality of life and prevent the full recovery after SAH. Identification and correction of these disorders should take a prominent place in the rehabilitation of post-SAH patients. More research is needed in this area.Психические расстройства нередко развиваются у пациентов, перенесших субарахноидальное кровоизлияние (САК). Наиболее распространенные из них - депрессия и парадепрессивные расстройства (тревожное расстройство, апатия, патологическая усталость, посттравматическое стрессовое расстройство и др.), в основе которых задействованы как психологические, так и биологические механизмы. Депрессия и парадепрессивные расстройства снижают качество жизни пациентов и препятствуют полноценному восстановлению после САК. Выявление и коррекция депрессии и парадепрессивных расстройств должны занимать важное место в реабилитации пациентов после САК. Необходимы дальнейшие исследования в этой области.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

A detailed and accurate medical history (plus family history, use of medication and eating habits) often easily leads to the diagnosis. Provoking tests or instrumental and histological investigations can help to solve difficult cases. Treatment focuses on relieving acute symptoms and attacks can be managed by correcting the blood potassium to a normal level.

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient.

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

      "title": "Psychological Factors and Heart Disease",
      "abstract": "A number of studies have revealed that perceived emotional stress can produce various transient cardiovascular responses. The reactions may include changes in heart rate and cardiac output. They may include abnormalities in heart rhythm, changes in blood pressure, peripheral resistance, blood viscosity, blood clotting time, and serum cholesterol levels. A hypothesis suggested by the findings which requires further research follows: If these cardiovascular responses were sustained for a period of time, they would ultimately influence the onset or course of coronary artery disease. These studies also suggest that emotional tension at one's work may place an additional strain on an already diseased heart. In patients whose cardiovascular system is already impaired, investigators have traced the sequence from emotional upset to heart disease. Since the reported evidence has been based on cardiac subjects, it is still possible that \"gradual increase in tension\" is perceived only after illness occurs, but not necessarily perceived as stressful before beart disease. Owing to the lack of prospective studies in which the life stress factors are studied prior to heart disease, emotion as a cause or contributory factor to heart disease has not been fully accepted. These studies suggest that certain personality traits may be common to certain forms of heart disease. Most of this evidence has been observed from time-consuming, detailed personality analysis, and the evidence depends on studies of relatively few patients and poor or no controls. It is important to note that these studies on personality type and heart disease were conducted after heart disorders developed. This raises the question of whether the reported personality characteristics preceded or followed the heart disease. The investigations to date assume that the personality structure occurred before the appearance of the heart disease, but before we can answer this question, a longitudinal study of the personality of individuals prior to cardiovascular disease would be necessary.",

      "title": "Sharp’s syndrome and psychiatric disorders in liaison psychiatry: An observation",
      "abstract": "Observation: We report the case of Mr. T, of Bosnian origin, in a situation of extreme social precarity, who presented with Sharp’s syndrome, discovered two years prior. He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder. The liaison psychiatrist recommended a multidisciplinary transversal management of the patient.",

      "title": "Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness",
      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

The patient may appear tired, self-concerned, bored, and inattentive and display a loss of interest in the surroundings. Anxiety is a conspicuous and an integral element of affective state and may be expressed by severe restlessness and agitation. Muscle tension, wringing of hands, weeping and moaning, repeating over and over in a monotonous and stereotyped way phrases expressive of misery are all important clinical signs of major depression. Similarly tachycardia, dry tongue/mouth, sweaty palms and/or bodily extremities, cold clammy skin, pallor, pupillary dilatation, tremor, and the fluctuations in blood pressure with wide pulse pressure are all important and give away the underlying distress. These signs have formed an integral part of both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale as they have a positive correlation with the diagnosis and the severity of illness. Current practice of operational criteria does not help exclude patients with subjective perception of distress and also fails to make room for aetiopathogenesis. The DSM-IV does not include these physical signs as an integral part of the clinical picture of depression, consequently leaving the diagnosis of MDE to subjective criteria and perceptions. This could also explain a large placebo response in recent randomised controlled clinical trials.",

      "title": "Stress Characterization is a more Reliable Approach for the Assessment of Metabolism than Blood Glucose Value",
      "abstract": "The stress reaction (acute, repetitive or chronic stress patterns) is a non-specific response of an organism to a pathological state. The metabolic characteristics of these stress patterns are well documented. Recognizing the interrelation between a stress-induced pathological state and the relevant pattern of the resultant stress reaction can provide a more accurate assessment of actual cellular metabolism than an approach relying on blood glucose values. Stress activation is obligatorily associated with negative energetic balance in affected cellular metabolism, which is reversed by elimination of the stressor. Prolongation of the stress reaction is a marker indicating the ineffective elimination of the causal stressor. Chronic stress induces progressive self-generating cellular metabolic dysfunction, resulting in the development of both diabetic and ischaemic disorders. Chronic stress conditions are characterized by reductions in inducible metabolic capacity, acute stress tolerance, and functional performance, accompanied by stress-specific micro- and macroscopic alterations. Chronic stress can be activated by both somatic and psychomental stressors. Diabetes, starvation, obesity, ageing, pregnancy, and any chronic disease state of a vital organ are associated with activation of stress reaction. The increased susceptibility of diabetic patients on gliflozins to the development of postoperative euglycaemic ketoacidosis can be explained by a reduction in chronic stress-associated acute stress tolerance, related mainly to diabetes, and a relative glucose deficiency induced by gliflozin therapy. Chronic hyperglycaemia associated with chronic stress should be considered both the primary cause and the secondary consequence of cellular dysmetabolism. Achievement of near-normoglycaemia is a beneficial effect but is not a causal intervention",

      "abstract": "In this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or absence of pain, albeit not in an \"all or nothing\" manner. Severity depends not only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016, and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods, fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence, prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants, psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation, surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of them.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is common in presenile population. The overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric disorders can lead to wrong/late diagnosis which cause delays/difficulties regarding case-management. Especially, long-standing and/or late-onset depression can descriptively envelop bvFTD (behavioral-variant) and leads to unnecessary treatments and increased distress. It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Evaluación de funciones cognitivas: atención y memoria en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Evidence from recent studies about the epidemiology of panic disorder (PD) indicates that it is present in 4.7% of general population. In Mexico City, 2.9% of females and 1.9% of males are affected by this disease. Due to the incidence cited above, it is considered an important mental health problem that has impacted social, labor and familiar areas. On the other hand, PD is frequently present in comorbidity with other disorders like major depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk. PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities. One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes. Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry «Ramon de la Fuente» in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions. We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory. Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms. The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p<0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12. The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control. According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls. In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency. This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder. In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations. Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.",

      "title": "The Interplay between Pain, Anxiety and Depression",
      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience with two inseparable components: sensory and emotional. The personal property of pain experience makes it difficult to manage and treat due to the influence of genetics, age, gender, spiritual beliefs, social-economic status, and cultural factors. Similarly, medical care methods partly control pain experience and regulate pain progression. Contrary to chronic pain, which is continuous and recurrent, acute pain is primarily due to trauma, acute medical conditions, or treatment. Whatever the case, both can cause mood disorders. The interplay between mood disorders and pain upholds a progressively significant bidirectional link, as mood disorders and pain are risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety heighten pain perception or decrease pain tolerance. Acute or chronic pain can also increase the chances of mood dysregulation. Although depression and anxiety have a close relationship with acute pain, the interplay between depression and acute pain is more comprehensively studied. Most depressed patients present pain as their sole complaint in primary care practices, which unfortunately is overlooked by physicians. Howbeit, reports on experimentally induced pain perception in depressed patients are mixed, presenting both an amplified and reduced pain threshold and tolerance. Although there are less published data about pain and anxiety, the association is regular because increased anxiety equally increases pain perception while decreasing tolerance. The aim of this review was to elucidate more on the mechanisms delineating the interconnectivity of pain and mood disorders.",

Metodologia: Revisao bibliografica, com as bases de dados: Scielo, Lilacs e Medline publicados entre 2000 e 2016, utilizando os descritores: estresse ocupacional, frequencia cardiaca e doencas cardiovasculares. Foram utilizados como fonte de pesquisa, dissertacoes, monografias, artigos cientificos e revistas que tiveram seus principais argumentos analisados ao longo do presente artigo. Resultados e discussao: Ao estudar a literatura, foi possivel notar que os principais fatores que contribuem para o desenvolvimento do estresse no ambiente de trabalho e a exigencia fisica e psiquica, o excesso de cobranca, o excesso de atividades que se levam para casa e a falta de tempo para executar determinadas tarefas. Alem disto, foram mencionados outros fatores como os turnos variaveis, as longas jornadas de trabalho, as horas extras, o ritmo excessivamente acelerado e a responsabilidade com os alunos e com a instituicao. Quanto as principais consequencias na variabilidade da frequencia cardiaca, destacam-se a taquicardia, a arritmia ventricular, o aumento no debito cardico, o aumento na frequencia cardiaca, o aumento na contratilidade e da pressao arterial. Conclusao: Como nao se podem evitar tais problemas e nem resolve-los, a melhor maneira para conduzir uma vida saudavel e sem maiores problemas e saber lidar com os conflitos diarios motivados pelo ambiente de trabalho. Para tanto, e recomendado a pratica de atividades fisicas, como a ginastica laboral, que ajuda a aliviar a exaustao fisica e psicologica desses docentes, alem de diminuir a tensao e ansiedade causada pelo estresse ocupacional.",

      "abstract": "Two groups of patients with psychogenic pain syndromes were compared: in one group, pain was the sole major clinical complaint; in the other symptoms of depression also presented in addition to the pain. In both groups, the patient considers himself to be physically ill, despite the absence of organic findings. On the basis of the clinical examples, the psychodynamics of chronic pain is discussed with respect to primary and secondary epinosic gain, conscious and unconscious processes involving personal loss, proffered offences, desires and affects. In the absence of depressive symptoms, the psychological organization of pain can be understood as a substitution. Such a situation leads to a \"stabilization\" of the symptom and more prolonged chronicity than when depression presents at the same time, since in these patients, referral for psychotherapy is delayed.",

Symptoms that arise may be an exaggerated statement of physical symptoms, which will actually exacerbate physical symptoms caused by the belief that the patient is sick and in a worse condition than the actual situation. Treatment of hypochondriasis includes recording symptoms, psychosocial review, and psychotherapy. Good prognosis is associated with high socioeconomic status, sudden onset, absence of personality disorders and absence of concomitant non-psychiatric medical conditions.",

This happens even where clear disease processes are involved, such as the dementias. They may represent different areas of a spectrum of illness/condition and/or be part of a spectrum of illnesses/conditions. However, they share both these characteristics with many general medical diagnostic constructs. For spectrums of illness/condition this may be because there are no natural boundaries but that it is important or seems obvious to recognize different areas of the spectrum for reasons of clinical utility (such as different prognostic implications or treatments) or different clinical pictures. For spectrums of illnesses/conditions the reason for co-occurrence may be because different diagnostic constructs have similar causes/mechanisms. On the other hand, these problems of lack of boundaries are not present as commonly in general medical diagnostic constructs. Alternative mental health classifications do not have the same issues with co-occurrence. They may be more useful in research to discover reasons why co-occurrence of symptoms may occur but have pragmatic drawbacks for other classification functions.",

Nach der „Global Burden of Disease”-Studie der WHO gehören depressive Störungen schon jetzt zu den Erkrankungen, die zum größten Verlust an Lebensjahren aufgrund der Beeinträchtigung durch die Störung führen. Depressionen werden von den Betroffenen als beeinträchtigender erlebt als die meisten somatischen Erkrankungen. Hinzu kommt, dass viele chronische somatische Erkrankungen im Verlauf durch das Hinzutreten einer depressiven Störung weiter verkompliziert werden. Bei vielen Erkrankten wird die Diagnose nur mit großer Verzögerung oder gar nicht gestellt, und wenn sie richtig gestellt wird, erfolgt die Behandlung oft nur unzureichend. Wahrscheinlich werden weniger als 10 % der Betroffenen medikamentös adäquat behandelt. Dies liegt auch daran, dass nach wie vor nicht nur z.B. Patienten mit schizophrenen Störungen oder Substanzabhängigkeiten von gesellschaftlicher Stigmatisierung betroffen sind, sondern auch Patienten mit depressiven Störungen. Auch dies trägt dazu bei, dass viele von dieser schwerwiegenden Erkrankung Betroffene den Gang zum Arzt scheuen. Konsens ist heute auch, dass das Ziel der Behandlung nicht mehr nur die Response, d.h. das (partielle) Ansprechen auf die Therapie, sein darf, sondern dass in jedem Fall die Remission angestrebt werden muss.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "abstract": "If an hysterical patient went to a physician in the late nineteenth century, chances were the diagnostic focus would be on the somatic symptomatology.The patient exhibiting hysterical blindness or paralysis was treated by an ophthalmologist or neurologist, who looked for pathological evidence of disease, deterioration, or damage.These procedures signaled a triumph over an earlier view that perceived hysteria as a largely female complaint in which a woman's uterus detached itself and floated about throughout her body.l With the work of Charcot, Janet, and especially Freud, hysteria came to be appreciated as an anxiety reaction whose pathological locus was emotional, not physiological, and was therefore not restricted to women.Today popular wisdom recognizes that certain cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms originate with severe psychological stress.Nevertheless, the attraction persists for accepting the manifest sign or symptom as the most accurate measure of mental and physical health.There is an obvious need to grapple with manifest behavior.But in some instances the more accurate interpretation of behavior is to be found in latent material.The word \"hysteria\" in ordinary usage denotes the loss of self-control and a diminished if not total incapacity for rational and logical thinking.Hysterical individuals therefore represent chaos, disorder, and a loss of reality testing.Yet the hysterical individual may also represent a complicated organization in which the overt symptoms of emotional collapse serve to conceal personality deficits and conflicts.Where the outward impression presented by the hysterical individual may seem disorderly, it may also signify a series of psychologically defensive maneuvers designed to maintain a distorted but nevertheless cohesive internal sense of order.In history the crowd has often been likened to the hysterical individual.In his celebrated nineteenth-century study, Gustave Le Bon included the following in his convictions about crowd behavior: \"It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of crowds there Mazon_3241.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

It represents an efficient system of information introducing or evoking a series of defensive mechanisms concerning acute illness, whereas the chronic ache is senseless, because it doesn't take over any protective functions; on the contrary, it burdens the total organism, especially the vegetativum and the psyche as well. Chronic pain very often renders independent, then it is no longer any symptom of a disease, but the disease itself: the idiopathic or unspecific syndrome of pain. Analyzing, for example, rheumatological aspects of a case, you can recognise that there exist continuous transitions from concrete local pain to diffuse indefinite psychalgia, whilst that gliding scale is more and more defined by psychic causes. Many aspects of cases imply a lot of such components. Obviously those syndromes of diseases are increasing where only pure psychosomatic facts exist, that is to say when soma is not the primary source but the scenery.",

Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat.

      "abstract": "Introdução: Cefaleia representa um problema de saúde pública, podendo ser primárias, quando são por si só a patologia ou secundárias quando são apenas um sintoma de uma outra patologia de base. Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

      "abstract": "A differentiation between the normal sensation of tiredness and the symptom \"fatigue\" is often difficult. Both are influenced by cultural, social, psychological and biological factors, which can lead--interactively--to symptom formation. Psychiatric disorders frequently associated with fatigue are all forms of depression, somatization and anxiety disorders, chronic pain states and drug abuse among many others. In at least 2/3 of patients with the fashionable chronic fatigue syndrome--formerly called neurasthenia--a psychiatric diagnosis can be made, most of them also suffer from many symptoms attributes to the autonomous nervous system. The clinical approach should be cautious avoiding diagnostic and therapeutic overaction and therapy should emerge from a diagnosis properly assessed.",

      "abstract": "Depressive Störungen und demenzielle Erkrankungen treten ab dem 65. Lebensjahr einzeln und zusammen gehäuft auf. Ziel dieser Übersicht ist es, anhand einer systematischen Literaturrecherche eine Reihe von Hypothesen zu diskutieren, die dieses überzufällig häufige, gemeinsame Auftreten erklären sollen. Eine Anzahl von Untersuchungen weist auf biologische Gemeinsamkeiten zwischen Depression und Demenz hin, ohne dass diese in allen Studien untermauert werden können. Die Vorgeschichte einer Depression kann als distaler Risikofaktor für demenzielle Erkrankungen angesehen werden. Besonders nach Ausbruch demenzieller Erkrankungen sind depressive Störungen häufig und der Zusammenhang zwischen beiden wahrscheinlich am stärksten. Bei Patienten mit großer kognitiver Reserve kann eine Depression als Reaktion auf die Wahrnehmung der beginnenden kognitiven Defizite gedeutet werden. Sicherlich können Depressionen bei der Alzheimer-Demenz und anderen Demenzformen als eigene Krankheitsentität angesehen werden, zumal sich die klinischen Syndrome von denen anderer Depressionen in früheren Lebensabschnitten etwas unterscheiden. Studien über die Therapie von Depressionen bei Demenzen haben in den letzten Jahren ein steigendes Interesse gefunden. Dabei müssen jedoch bei der Behandlung älterer Patienten mit Antidepressiva einige Regeln beachtet werden, besonders kardiologische und vegetative Nebenwirkungen.",

      "title": "Unraveling the Enigma: Clinical Research on Depersonalization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract The human brain, the only organ capable of studying itself, has in the last century turned its attention toward the mysterious phenomenon of depersonalization, examining it from many perspectives. Depersonalization disorder (DPD) remains one of the most frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed conditions in modern psychiatry. Why? Likely for several reasons. DPD is often accompanied by anxiety, depression, or other disorders, and patients may have trouble or hesitation expressing its vagaries in words that anyone but fellow sufferers can understand. Patients often wind up being treated for depression or anxiety, even though they have tried to make clear that they were depressed or anxious only initially in their depersonalization course, or only well after depersonalization had set in. The patients are often clear that what they are struggling most with are feelings of “unreality,” “deadness,” or “no self” and that they know the difference from being solely depressed or anxious. Clinicians, however, do not always agree, possibly because they have solid training in—and are more comfortable dealing with—the domains of anxiety and depression.",

Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

Grief, the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to bereavement, is both a ubiquitous and a unique psychological process. Thus, health providers often find themselves in a dilemma, caught between the need to alleviate an individual's distress and impairment, and the danger of overly \"pathologizing\" their grief reaction.

These disorders are generally wellcharacterised and management usually associated with good symptomatic and functional outcomes. Immediate activation of an inbuilt and hard-wired basic pain system serves a primary protective function to the host. Another system, perhaps best described as an advanced pain system, augments, amplifies, and extends the role of the pain system to other functions. Emotional distress has a potent effect on this process and drives a series of events that results in altered ‘downstream’ musculoskeletal symptoms and function. Under these circumstances chronic pain states may arise and may particularly involve the musculoskeletal tissues. Fibromyalgia syndrome is used here as an example of a common chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome, characterised by widespread pain and tenderness, in order to allow for discussion of the biopsychosocial inputs that must be addressed to provide the best clinical outcome.

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

Feeling really anxious most of the time will certainly put added pressure on your body. Panic attacks can be exhausting, leaving you feeling really ill afterwards.

      "title": "Depressão e comorbilidade: Um caso clínico",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

      "title": "Prescribing for depressed adolescents: Office decision-making in the face of limited research evidence",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relatively common, disabling, potentially life-threatening medical condition.1 MDD is diagnosed when there are five or more symptoms occurring over 2 or more weeks.2 Adult and adolescent symptoms of MDD are almost the same. However, irritable mood and lack of weight gain can qualify as depressive symptoms in adolescents.2 The lifetime prevalence of unipolar depression (MDD or dysthymic disorder) in adolescence is 11.7%; three-quarters of this percentage suffer severe impairment.3 Adolescent MDD has very high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders.4 Depression is the condition most commonly implicated in adolescent and adult suicide.5 Adolescent depression runs a remitting and relapsing course, often recurring later in adolescence or adulthood6, 7 (see Fig. 1). Of those adolescents who recover from their depression, about 50% will have another depressive episode in the next 5 years.6, 8 In summary, adolescent MDD is a serious and sometimes chronic medical condition that requires assertive treatment. Course of adolescent major depression. *No depressive symptoms for over 2 months. A number of antidepressants have come onto the market since 1987 that provide fewer side effects at therapeutic dose and in overdose than the older tricyclic antidepressants.9, 10 These newer agents include the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram), the serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine). The prescribing of antidepressants to children and adolescents has increased from 1996 to 2007.11 Overall, 19% of Australian paediatricians and 68% of child psychiatrists self-report prescribing SSRIs.12 However, this is very unlikely to be specifically for major depression, as paediatricians prescribe across a broad variety of diagnoses and at times for off-label conditions. The SSRIs are a class of antidepressant that have a high affinity for blocking the presynaptic serotonin transport proteins but not the other monoamine transmembrane transport proteins.13 SSRIs differ in their effects through secondary binding to non-serotonergic receptors,14 the antidepressant effects of their metabolites, their excretion half-lives and their effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.15 Despite their differences, the available SSRIs are all effective treatments for moderate adult depression16 and display similar overall side effect profiles.15 In 2004, evidence emerged from antidepressant trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours in children and adolescents given antidepressants. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered that pharmaceutical companies add a ‘black box’ warning on all antidepressant medication warning of the heightened risk of suicidality.17 There have been several key guidelines, meta-analyses and papers published since the FDA black box warning that have added further information in an attempt to clarify the role of antidepressants in the treatment of depressed adolescents. Despite the increasing amount of information available, it is our contention that the available literature remains limited and at times contradictory about prescribing. A selective review of the key papers is provided with a discussion on the implication for practice-based management of depressed adolescents. The association of antidepressants and suicidal behaviour in adolescents is discussed elsewhere.18 Do antidepressant drugs work at all in adolescent depression? There is universal agreement that tricyclic antidepressants have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that there was no difference in the rate of recovery in children and adolescents with depressive disorder between those given tricyclic antidepressants and those given placebo treatments.19 The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English peer-reviewed journals for the treatment of adolescent or combined adolescent/child depression (n = 14) are shown in Table 1. The majority of the studies were industry-funded and were conducted in North America. Unpublished and non-English-language studies on nefazodone, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine have been noted elsewhere.34-37 Fluoxetine is the drug with the most consistent positive response, in three out of the four studies. On the basis of evidence of efficacy from RCTs, the FDA has approved both fluoxetine, in 2003,38 and escitalopram (the active enantiomer of citalopram), in 2009, for use in adolescent depression.39 While seven studies show superiority of drug over placebo, the reported findings from some of the studies have been queried since publication. A study of sertraline by Wagner et al. (2003) that reported positive results had in fact pooled two studies with the same methodology.25 When each of the sertraline studies is taken on its own there is no significance in either study.18 Jureidini (2008) noted that the significant difference between paroxetine and placebo reported by Keller et al. (2001) was found using measures not cited in the original protocol (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression depressed mood item, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Lifetime depressed mood item, Clinical Global Impression).40 It is possible that the outcomes reported from each of the RCTs may be influenced by the variables related to the study design, medication compliance, placebo response rate and the nature of the cohort recruited.37, 41-43 The differences between the studies restrict direct comparison of their reported findings. The limitations of single RCTs point us to systematic reviews with meta-analyses that have the capacity to pool data and address the problem of small sample sizes.44 An early meta-analysis (n = 5 RCTs) reported a small effect size for antidepressants over placebo, with suggested negligible clinical benefit.45 Tsapakis et al. (n = 29 RCTs including tricyclics) reported an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 9, with a higher response rate in adolescents compared with children.46 Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry (n = 12 RCTs)47 and Whittington et al. (n = 5 RCTs)48 reported a modest benefit for fluoxetine over placebo. In summary, these meta-analyses found small effect sizes that have been interpreted as reflecting limited to negligible clinical improvement. The most recent Cochrane review (n = 19 RCTs) of 3335 participants treated with newer antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine)35 found a small statistically significant difference in response/remission favouring antidepressants over placebo, but this finding was qualified as being not clinically meaningful.35 Other authors came to different conclusions. Bridge et al. (n = 15 RCTs) found in their meta-analysis that the NNT for antidepressants in children and adolescent MDD was 10 but advocated for ‘the cautious and well monitored’ use of antidepressants.37 Other techniques have been used to assess antidepressant efficacy. Gibbons et al. (2012) pooled all the data from each participant in the fluoxetine RCT studies (n = 708) over the first 6 weeks of treatment, arguing this approach was superior to a meta-analysis as it utilised all the data available.49 Gibbons et al. found that using fluoxetine compared with placebo, the NNT for response to treatment was 4.49 Higher response and remission rates were reported for fluoxetine in depressed youth than adults.49 The overall findings suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and less evidence for that of other antidepressants in the short term. The various complex analyses, in the main, have been confusing, as different authors have argued for exclusion of selected RCTs from analysis depending on their orientation.46, 50, 51 Further, meta-analysis itself is not an exact science and is open to some interpretation depending on which studies are included, the quality of the studies and the nature of the statistical analysis (fixed-effects vs. random-effects regression).37, 52 Some studies that have compared combined cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication treatments to monotherapeutic approaches for adolescent depression have shown differences in the relative efficacy of CBT, antidepressants or combination after 3 months.31, 53 However, there is convergence in efficacy across all the treatments (medication vs. CBT vs. combination) in the subsequent months53, 54 and years.8 In a meta-analysis of five RCTs, antidepressants (predominantly fluoxetine) have been shown to be equivalent to a combination of antidepressant and CBT at 26 and 36 weeks' follow-up.55 These findings challenge the assumption that two treatments are ultimately better than one. In contrast, for adolescents with MDD who do not respond to the initial SSRI, changing to another antidepressant (SSRI or venlafaxine), especially in conjunction with CBT, has been shown to result in an improvement in depressive symptoms in half of patients.56 In this treatment-resistant group the change to a combination of CBT and antidepressant or another antidepressant led to 38.9% achieving remission at 24 weeks.57 RCTs of antidepressant efficacy have typically aimed to examine short-term outcome (2 to 3 months). Adolescent depressive disorder runs a relapsing, remitting course into early adulthood.6 There have been two placebo-controlled studies of children and adolescents with MDD looking at relapse prevention.58, 59 Over 32 weeks' (n = 40) and 6 months' (n = 102) follow-up of patients who remitted from MDD, fewer patients relapsed on fluoxetine than placebo, and those on placebo relapsed more quickly than those on fluoxetine,58, 59 providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of fluoxetine in reducing risk of MDD relapse. Kennard et al. conducted a pilot study of adolescents with MDD (n = 46) who had responded to fluoxetine, randomising them to CBT and fluoxetine or fluoxetine only over the next 6 months.60 Those adolescents who were given CBT and fluoxetine were eight times less likely to relapse than those who received medication alone.60 There is early evidence that in the continuation phase of treatment (6 to 12 months after the acute phase), there is a role for antidepressant and possibly CBT prophylaxis to prevent relapse. Depression in children and adolescents is associated with parental depression.61 This association is likely to be mediated by genetic susceptibility; exposure to parental depressive emotions, cognitions and behaviours; and increased familial stresses. Intervention studies to treat depressed parents have largely focused on maternal depression.62 For depressed adolescents whose mothers are concurrently depressed, treating the mother's depression has been shown to improve internalising disorders in their offspring.63 This improvement continues at 12-month follow-up.64 These studies, taken together, point to the importance of looking at the whole family system and not just treating the adolescent in isolation. There are several clinical practice guidelines that incorporate these research findings and expert opinion to assist paediatricians in the management of the depressed adolescent. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care treatment (GLAD-PC) were published in 2007,65 the beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines were released in 2010,66 and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were released in 200567 and updated in 2011 without change. The NICE guidelines recommend that children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression should be offered, as first-line treatment, CBT, interpersonal therapy or short-term family therapy of at least 3 months' duration. Antidepressants should only be prescribed if the adolescent has moderate to severe depression, is assessed by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tier 2 or 3 professional and is receiving concurrent psychological treatment. The beyondblue guidelines recommend that fluoxetine should be considered for reduction of depressive symptoms in the short term where psychological treatment has failed, is inaccessible or is refused.66 The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend using an SSRI for moderate to severe depression, outlining dosing regiments for six different SSRIs.65 The NICE guidelines appear to be the most conservative in their recommendations and the GLAD-PC the most liberal. The recommendation for the use of antidepressants in the short term by the beyondblue guidelines is in line with the evidence base, which, in the main, has investigated short-term outcomes of depression. A number of factors limit the clinician's ability to apply RCT findings in his or her practice.68 The RCTs described use placebos, are short-term and are not representative of those depressed adolescents who present in the clinician's office. Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry reported that the children and adolescents in RCTs were unlike those who presented for treatment, who were suffering with lower levels of comorbidity and suicidality.47 The paediatrician often sees patients who would be excluded from most of the adolescent depression RCTs. For instance, there is scant information about the assessment of use of antidepressants in those with MDD and developmental disability,69 leaving them therapeutic orphans. Further, the clinician does not have the option of using a placebo. If the likelihood of a short-term response is 61% on an antidepressant,37 where does that leave the prescribing clinician? It is very likely that many clinicians will consider trialling an SSRI. Seligman (1998) has made the point that the aims of clinical trials overlap with those of the practicing clinician, but they are not the same thing. Seligman notes that clinical trials are largely short-term, single-intervention studies, usually focusing on a single outcome (e.g. reduction in depressive symptoms).70 By contrast, clinical work is, in the main, a long-term engagement, involving multiple treatments that are self-correcting.70 The decision to medicate, while guided by the available research, is also directed by the adolescent's severity of symptoms, unique strengths and vulnerabilities, family factors, access to mental health services and individual wishes of the patient and his or her parents. The paediatrician is well placed to integrate all these factors. The treatment guidelines for adolescent depression suggest that the role of antidepressants is as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe depression as part of stepped treatment where there has been inadequate response to psychological therapies. Of the antidepressants, fluoxetine has the strongest evidence of efficacy; however, the evidence is largely short-term. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that fluoxetine can prevent relapse. Tricyclics have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. CBT may be added to an antidepressant; however, evidence of an additive effect is limited. Effectiveness studies are largely unavailable, and treatment response rates may vary in clinical practice. If an adolescent and his or her mother are both depressed, then both are likely to benefit if the mother is the one who takes and responds to an antidepressant.",

Depression and sexual dysfunction have long been known as comorbid conditions; however, some research suggests that depressed mood may not always be associated with specific sexual dysfunctions. Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues. Finally, we summarize the core principles of evaluation and treatment of common sexual dysfunctions, particularly in the context of depressive illness.",

CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches.

      "abstract": "The following case study illustrates the clinical role of mental health professionals who specialize in the treatment of people with diabetes. This case describes the diagnostic dilemma presented by a patient with diabetes and a history of severe hypoglycemia complicated by other medical, psychiatric, social, and functional problems.\n\nCognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, increased distractibility, and confusion) can present a difficult diagnostic problem for clinicians because it can be symptomatic of many underlying and undetected clinical conditions. Careful diagnosis is crucial because some causes may be progressive and irreversible, whereas other causes may be reversible with medical or psychiatric treatment. Some of the more noteworthy causes are related to medication, alcohol, aging, depression, and, as in this case study, the possible consequences of recurrent severe hypoglycemia related to diabetes.1 Diabetes, of course, may cause an increase in cognitive decline over the course of time because of vascular risk factors.2 Some evidence suggests that acute hyperglycemia may have a negative impact on cognitive performance.3\n\nDepression is the most common of the reversible causes of memory impairment, and people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those without diabetes.4 Recent evidence suggests that diabetes may create alterations in regions of the brain that are associated with affect regulation and increase the risk for developing a depressive disorder.5 Fortunately, problematic medications can be modified, and alcohol misuse or depression can be treated. Unfortunately, despite its relevance to the course of diabetes, depression is recognized and treated in fewer than one-third of people with diabetes.4\n\nThe relationship between recurrent severe hypoglycemia and cognitive impairment remains unclear. Both prospective and longitudinal studies of cognitive function have been so plagued by methodological problems that it is difficult to unequivocally determine whether patients who experience repeated episodes …",

A proper search for the underlying cause of the anxiety is essential if the clinician is to make a correct diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment. Two aspects of the patient's history are particularly important during assessment: the duration and severity of medical illness (and treatments) and the duration and severity of anxiety symptoms. When acute anxiety is encountered, the clinician must rule out a rapidly worsening medical condition, substance-induced anxiety (toxicity or withdrawal), and a psychological reaction to stressors associated with the medical illness. During evaluation of medically ill individuals with chronic anxiety, the clinician must rule out medical disorders that can mimic anxiety disorders, psychiatric disorders associated with anxiety symptoms, and poor adjustment to the medical illness. It is also worth remembering that anxiety disorders occur at an increased frequency in individuals who have chronic medical illness.",

The clinical manifestations were characterized by peculiar emotional disorders, polymorphous autonomic and vascular shifts. These states occurred in the majority of cases after some somatic diseases in conjunction with other physical or psychological stresses in individuals with anxiety traits and 'neurocirculatory asthenia'. The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions. Subsequently dysphoric mood, somatic concerns, pseudoneurotic and neurotic syndromes appeared. The outcome of the disorders was either with slow practical recovery or with a relatively stable personality change in the form of weakened volition, a reduction of energy, and a narrowing of the 'zone of comfort' due to the impairment of homeostatic functions. Often hypochondriasis could develop on the background of such features. Dysthymia is viewed as a special entity which must not be included either in the group of neuroses or in the group of typical organic brain syndromes, or in the group of endogenous psychoses.",

These disorders arise at the intersection of lesion-related brain dysfunction and psychological distress related to the event and its aftermath, making it difficult to identify what symptom is a direct physiological consequence of the stroke. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment. Further research is needed to understand and tailor treatment of these disorders in the poststroke population.",

The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness.

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

In individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), reports of psychosis have included cases that would meet criteria for delirium, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression. The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

Emotional disturbances may mask these subtle problems, but they can also result from them. Clinical experience indicates that these problems are more apt to become stressful when the patient misinterprets or copes ineffectively with them. That these common problems of brain injured adults may be overlooked in the usual clinical examination was shown in a comparison of clinical records of 50 patients referred for neuropsychological consultation with records of 46 patient-participants in a longitudinal neuropsychological study. Significantly more reports of these problems appeared in the latter group of records. However, consultation records did reflect emotional distress. Irritability, depression, or anxiety affected all but six consultation patients and appeared with equal frequency among working patients as among those unable to work or needing full-time care. This suggests that some of their emotional distress resulted from less obvious problems than those impairing mobility, strength, or competency. Counseling can reduce the patient's vulnerability to the psychologically crippling effects of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue.

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

      "abstract": "Résumé La découverte d'une chimiothérapie antidépressive a eu, sur le plan theorique, des conséquences qui n'étaient pas apparues avec celle des neuroleptiques et des tranquillisants. Le terme meme d'antidepresseur le souligne. Il s'agit en effet d'une classe de molécules qui agissent sur un ensemble de comportements définis et sur eux seuls. La question demeure ouverte de savoir comment les modifications neurophysiologiques obtenues par ces molecules agissent sur le comportement. Le fait que nous n'ayons pas une réponse précise à cette question explique sans doute la part importante de la resistance que Ton rencontre encore dans la prescription des antidepresseurs. On ne retrouve pas ce fait pour les neuroleptiques et les tranquillisants, bien que ces derniers présentent des effets secondaires plus nocifs (dyskinésie ou troubles mnésiques par exemple). Une première erreur consiste à confondre cause et mécanisme. Ce n'est pas parce que la chimiotherapie depressive agit sur la symptomatologie que le déficit qu'elle corrige est nécessairement, et encore moins uniquement, la cause de survenue de cet etat. En ce qui concerne les causes, nous devons conserver un point de vue pluraliste et uniciste à la fois en considerant qu'il s'agit d'une «maladie» pluri-factorielle. En termes de mécanisme, notre pensee doit demeurer resolument dualiste et reconnaftre un principe de parallélisme entre événements neurophysiologiques et événements comportementaux. La seconde erreur consiste à confondre liaison synaptique avec le concept classique de centre nerveux. Un exemple de cette confusion nous est peut-être donné par la recherche, jusqu'à présent stérile, de dépressions «noradrénergique» ou «sérotoninergique». Il est fort possible que les molécules dont nous disposons agissent sur des rélais dans un reseau de neurones qui sont impliqués dans les mécanismes comportementaux. La troisième erreur porte sur la manière dont nous traitons l'analyse comportementale de la dépression en se référant à une sémiologie qui a été construite à des fins tout-à-fait différentes (diagnostic d'une maladie et prévision de son évolution). Une analyse comportementale qui voudrait cerner de plus près l'action des molécules devrait renoncer à cette sémiologie et dégager des traits de comportement directement sensibles à l'action des medicaments. A la notion trop vague et trop globale de trouble de l'humeur, il serait sans doute utile de substituer celle de système ou plan d'action et de mecanisme d'interruption ou de ralentissement de l'exécution de ces plans.",

      "abstract": "The presence of physical symptoms that do not correlate with a disease process are often frustrating to healthcare professionals, are difficult to diagnose and may consume an inordinate proportion of healthcare resources. However, proper and complete physical and psychological assessment and treatment is becoming increasingly possible and essential. Physical illness may occur concomitantly and sometimes as a result of psychological distress, which has displayed itself in a diagnosed mental illness. In other cases physical symptoms may be caused by unconscious dynamics, and the process becomes the primary presenting mental concern. In other cases the physical illness is part of a conscious process and motivated by the hope of gain. Differentiation between physical symptoms of unconscious and conscious origin is important in selecting the correct response. A manager must first of all be alert for physical symptoms that appear to be consciously motivated, as in a disorder called \"malingering.\" The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation. Managers may inadvertently encourage malingering in the workplace by inappropriate responses to employees who present a physical complaint that is consciously motivated for gain. When the manager can recognize this phenomenon as malingering, appropriate managerial intervention can cause this behavior to be controlled and even eliminated and thus enhance productivity.",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

Traditionally, this group includes depressive disorders, mania and submaniacal states, and anxiety disorders. A light form of depression is often unrecognized. The person feels chronic fatigue, weariness and discouragement to life. Depression caused by reactive factors is manifested by a smaller number of psychosomatic symptoms. According to the WHO (World Health Organization) report, by 2020 depression may become the second largest health risk after cardiovascular disease. The clinical picture of depression is dominated primarily by the depressed mood, which is felt by the patient as a state of gloom, resignation, and sadness. The patient is unable to experience joy, happiness and satisfaction. Anhedonia appears, or inability to feel any pleasures. A separate problem is the recognition of depression in the elderly age, when symptoms characteristic to depression are very often considered a normal manifestation of the body aging or as an inherent element of the somatic disease. Currently, it is estimated that as many as 40% of cases of depression in people over 65 remain undiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is difficult to make when a depressed patient can provide no evidence of having experienced mania or hypomania, either because the elevated mood states are not recognized as periods of illness or because depression is the initial episode and the patient has yet to experience the other polarity of the disorder. In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

The words dizzy, giddy and vertiginous from a patient do not really mean different things - they only mean: I feel unbalanced or disequilibrated. In the anamnesis it is much more important to find out firstly whether the disturbances are: (1) paroxysmal; (2) one acute attack; (3) chronic, (4) positional (positioning), and secondly whether the giddy feeling is accompanied by other disturbances (deafness, headache, pains, palsies, etc.). Some tables are presented that give a survey of the combination of some of these data and that facilitate the further examination towards the goal of the right diagnosis.",

In geriatric practice we observe first-time onset of depression in the elderly or a reoccurrence of depression that first appeared at an earlier age. During this age period the most different interrelationships between depressions and somatic pathology can be observed: Depressions can be concomitants of somatic pathology or pathogenetically connected with somatic diseases most often with pathology of nervous, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems and osteoarticular apparatus (somatogenic depressions). Psychogenic and medicamentous depressions can also exist [1-4]. Diagnosis of depressions in aged patients is more difficult than in young patients due to a high frequency of atypical manifestations of affective disorders, predominance of somatic complaints, and difficulties in",

It is characteristic of many professions, especially professions that involve direct work with people (healthcare, education, army, etc.), and in sports it is almost inevitable. The two most common reasons that cause burnout syndrome are: setting hard-to-achieve goals or unrealistic deadlines and trying to meet other people's (imposed) expectations. In both cases, endurance limits are pushed, which leads to burnout and has consequences for the entire human body and psychophysical health. We live in a harsh age where it is not enough to be successful, the demand is to be the best. This ultimatum is particularly prominent in sports. Athletes are distinguished from others by discipline, perseverance, persistence, focus on the goal (victory), sacrifice and responsibility. Top fitness and top results are always expected from them. The question arises: Is it even possible to achieve top results and avoid the burnout syndrome? In addition to the analysis of causes, symptoms and consequences, the paper seeks an answer to this question.",

It is of equal importance compared with others in the 21st century. Stress management is a common phenomenon globally. The imbalance of any occasion creates stress. The most significant factors include separated from family, loneliness, fatigue, multi-nationality, limited recreation activity, and dissatisfaction of job opportunity, which tends to cause healthcare issues, especially sleep deprivation and depression. The long-lasting stress causes chronic mental fatigue. It has positive and negative impacts, which depend on situations. Sometimes it plays as a motivating factor for peak performance and great opportunity, or sometimes negative like when a person faces social, physical, organizational, and emotional problems.",

      "title": "Depression",
      "abstract": "The risk of developing depressive disorders is increased in most chronic medical conditions, and reciprocally, depression can be a risk factor for the development of medical illnesses (Ramasubbu et al. 2012). There are multiple nonspecific factors, such as disability and physical suffering, that may increase the risk of depression in serious medical illnesses. There is also speculation about whether specific biological mechanisms account for the comorbidity of depression with particular medical conditions. Depression is frequently underdiagnosed and untreated in medical settings, despite its frequency, negative effects on health, and responsiveness to treatment. This diagnostic and therapeutic neglect may be due to underreporting of symptoms because of stigma, difficulty distinguishing normative from pathological distress, physical symptom overlap between depression and medical illness, and lack of sufficient caregiver training in or comfort with mental health inquiry. There may also be mistaken beliefs among both providers and patients about the untreatability of depression that is \"understandable.\" Untreated depression is of concern in medical populations because it is associated with greater somatic symptom burden (Katon et al. 2007) and worse quality of life (Katon 2003) in common medical disorders. Depression is also associated with higher rates of health care utilization, such that the cost of medical care for depressed medical patients is 50% higher than that for nondepressed medical patients; depressed patients also tend to be less compliant with medical treatment and to have less functional capacity and less occupational productivity (Unützer et al. 2009). Paradoxically, depression is also overdiagnosed in medical settings, with unnecessary prescription of antidepressant medication for nonpathological sadness or grief or diagnoses based solely on scores on depression screening instruments. In this chapter we review the prevalence and clinical features of depression in the medically ill; discuss approaches to depression screening, diagnosis, and treatment; and explore mechanisms that may account for the etiology, course, and outcome of depression in the medical setting. We do not attempt to provide in-depth information on depression in particular diseases; for details on the effects of comorbid depression in various medical conditions, readers are referred to the chapters on specific disorders in this textbook.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "abstract": "Los medicos de urgencias trabajan con altos niveles de estres. Esto es un problema ya que la exposicion repetida conlleva un deterioro en la salud del medico. Se han postulado diversas variables que podrian facilitar la manifestacion del estres y otras que podrian proteger a los medicos de sus nocivos efectos. Algunas variables son la conducta empatica, satisfaccion y fatiga. Sin embargo, los resultados en la evaluacion de la satisfaccion y la empatia son modulados por factores culturales y la literatura pertinente proviene de poblaciones caucasicas, lo cual justifica una investigacion en nuestro contexto. Ademas no se han detectado estudios que evaluen la interaccion de dichas variables durante la consulta medica y algunas relaciones comunmente aceptadas son solo teoricas (por ejemplo las correlaciones positivas: empatia-satisfaccion y empatia estres). Tampoco se conoce la relacion de respuestas empaticas especificas (como parafrasis y resumen) sobre la satisfaccion y el estres del medico. Ademas una medicion objetiva esta justificada porque los medicos suelen negar la experiencia de problemas psicologicos. Evaluar la interaccion entre empatia, estres, satisfaccion y fatiga en medicos durante la consulta medica. Hipotesis: A mayor numero de conductas empaticas del medico, existe mas satisfaccion, y a mayor satisfaccion existe menos estres. Entonces a mayor numero de conductas empaticas existe menos estres Es un diseno observacional y secuencial. 20 Medicos que brinden consulta en el triage del departamento de urgencias, hombres y mujeres de cualquier edad que firmen un consentimiento informado. Se evaluara estres, fatiga, satisfaccion y conducta empatica en medicos durante la consulta (por medio de temperatura periferica corporal, reconocimiento facial y observacion conductual).

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and complex disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

Dentre todos os disturbios do movimento associados a disfuncao dos nucleos da base, a distonia e a menos compreendida em relacao a sua fisiopatologia. Recentestrabalhos revelaram que o circuito motor nucleos da base cortico-estriado-talamocortical apresenta um importante papel nas funcoes cognitivas nao-motoras, particularmente na discriminacao temporal e espacial e na integracao multisensorial. O limiar de discriminacao espacial foi encontrado anormal em pacientes com distonia focal nas maos, distonia cervical e blefaroespasmo. Um fenomeno distinto em distonia e o truque sensorial (ou geste antagonistique). Os truques sensoriais sao geralmentemanobras tateis ou de outra natureza sensorial envolvendo o lado afetado ou nao, que reduzem os movimentos e posturas distonicas. O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001. A sensibilidade espacial da mao dominante dos sujeitos que apresentam o truque sensorial foi significativamente maior que daqueles sujeitos que nao apresentam otruque sensorial (p=0,019;p<0,050). Conclusoes: Mais de 1/3 dos pacientes com espasmo hemifacial apresentaram truque sensorial. Truques sao mais comuns na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) e aogrupo caibra do escrivao (20%).

Quality of life in patients diagnosed with depressive major disorders is a rarely monitored parameter, although its importance for case management could not be overemphasized. A reduction of life quality correlates with a poorer functional prognosis, persistence of neglected residual symptoms, low adherence to treatment plan.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "title": "General features of motor fatigue a review",
      "abstract": "Summary Fatigue is an ubiquitous phenomenon that has many definitions, and it is always multidimensional comprising physiological and psychological aspects. It ranges from a chronic symptom in somatic and psychiatric disorders to time-related physiological alterations of primary cortical areas, and to efferent and afferent pathways of the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) in healthy exercise physiology. Thus, it is necessary to define the context when referring to fatigue. Fatigue can generally be defined as a difficulty in initiating or sustaining a voluntary activity, the latter also being named fatigability in a more strict sense of nomenclature. Fatigue in a clinical setting is best quantified by means of self-reported questionnaires, for example the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The discrimination of accounts of depression, sleepiness, weakness, exercise intolerance and exhaustion relies however on a focused interview, clinical signs, and on the use of additional para-clinical investigations. Time-related physiological alterations during fatiguing tasks can occur at spinal and supraspinal sites, termed central fatigue, as well as at the neuro-muscular junction and in muscle fibres, termed peripheral fatigue. In exercise physiology, both central and peripheral fatigu ec an be assessed by electrophysiological techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, electromyography), pharmacological intervention, functional magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory tests. In the myriad of neurological disorders that cause fatigue, ranging from chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis to neuro-muscular disorders and myopathy, different sites of pathological alterations are involved, all yielding to a patient complaining about excessive fatigue. This links the different aspects of fatigue, thus always calling for a multidimensional assessment of this intriguing phenomenon.",

The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease. In addition, the state of uncertainty allows the patient to activate the resources of coping with the disease, among which the leading role belongs to social support.",

      "abstract": "'Stress' is a familiar concept that upon analysis becomes a very difficult term to define, for it is necessary to consider the stimulus, the internal reactions to the stimulus, and the responses of the individual to the stimulus. Some assess stress on the basis of the changes in adrenal hormone secretion produced by a particular stimulus, thus focusing attention upon the response rather than the stimulus, but individuals do not all react in the same way so that a stimulus that is stressful to one is ignored, disregarded or not reacted to by another. Other investigators prefer to regard a particular stimulus (which they then call a stressor) as uniformly stressful, even though some individuals may not react in the anticipated manner, and some hardly at all. Surgery powerfully activates the hypothalamo—pituitary—adrenocortical system, and thus raises the output of the adrenal steroid cortisol, but the prospect of surgery can be just as effective, as can admission to hospital, the prospect of a college or university examination, or the expectation of exhausting physical exercise. On the one hand the physiological response to stress, as after injury, is of greatest concern, while on the other psychological factors, as in the assessment of the degree of personal threat, is paramount. Because of difficulties in classifying the stimuli, greater regard has been paid to the physiological response, but with repeated exposure to stress adaptation may occur, so complicating definition of a stress.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

Included in these descriptions would be ‘atypical facial pain’, and perhaps the similar pain syndromes which present in the mouth and the perineal regions. The term ‘atypical pain’ is most unsatisfactory, as it really means nothing to any observer except to the person who originally coined the phrase for pain which seemed to be an atypical variant of some other recognized condition. To be preferred is the expression ‘idiopathic pain’ with its implication of a disorder of pain perception, or ‘pain of unknown aetiology’.

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

      "title": "Psychophysiological aspects of chronic stress following trauma",
      "abstract": "Exposure to traumatic events has been associated with a range of phenomena ranging from mild distress to more severe outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At the heart of many of these outcomes is the stress process, which under acute conditions can be considered adaptive and essential for survival. To be sure, stress due to trauma is a normal response, despite the fact that emotional and psychophysiological processes may be at abnormal levels for a period of time. Disordered responses may follow an event which is outside the realm of normal human experience and which involves extreme threat or privation, including natural disasters, humanmade events such as war, fires, airplane crashes, chemical, nuclear, or toxic accidents, and more individual level traumas such as victimization by crime, rape, or automobile accidents. The vast majority of victims of these events experience only transient symptoms and recover readily. However, some victims appear to experience long-lasting stress following some kinds of trauma. Under some conditions, stress appears to persist and may form the basis of PTSD. In such cases, abnormal levels of response persist for abnormally long periods of time. Davidson and Baum (1986) suggested that situations which are not necessarily intense, but which pose lasting threats, may be associated with persistent symptoms of stress, arid that these chronic stress reactions are very similar to posttraumatic stress disorder, and may differ only in the intensity of the symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is etymologically combined with penalty, emotionally with anxiety and depression, and physiologically with inflammatory processes and other kinds of pressure augmentation in the tissues. Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be measured or “objectively” verified by other individuals. Reactions to pain, however, can be registered by others. Pain in the orofacial area may have several etiological explanations. Since the functional pattern of the area is multi‐faceted, persisting pain in the area most likely has a multi‐factorial background, and also a variety of effects. Treatment should be made considering delicate diagnostical distinctions. A thorough clinical examination contains lots of treatment components. This paper discusses some psychological factors in the diagnosis and treatment of orofacial pain.",

To the emotional unrest caused by these vestiges of ancient taboos may be added disturbances of the female reproductive organs that are caused by other emotional conflicts. In psychosomatic illness, the patient is a victim of some emotional conflict of which she is unaware. Her symptoms are real, but the causes are elusive. Because she is disturbed, she consults a physician in an effort to discover an organic basis for her symptoms. Menstrual disturbances; vague, low, abdominal pain; intramenstrual cramping; headache, nausea, vomiting; palpitation, loose stools, and urinary frequency may be associated with emotional conflicts. Marital problems may be the causative factor, or may intensify gynecological conditions. Sexual maladjustment may cause a woman to be frigid or to have dyspareunia. Menstrual disturbances may be the only manifestation of her unhappiness. Some physicians believe that emotional conflicts may play an important part in sterility. A patient who consults her physician because of symptoms for which no physical basis may be found needs as much sympathy and understanding as does the patient with demonstrable physical pathology. Her pains and aches, troubles and miseries, discontents and disappointments are very real to her; she must not simply be classed as neurotic, ignored when she lists her complaints, or rushed through her examination and consultation with the physician. The nurse's understanding will be of great comfort to this patient and perhaps will even be a factor in helping her get well.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

The reliability and validity of measures is not entirely satisfactory. When the stress concept used is that of ‘threat’ or ‘emotional distress’ it becomes of crucial importance to define clearly the criterion variable: in particular, it is necessary to distinguish normal distress responses from depressive illness. In those studies using general practice or hospital patients it is important to determine whether life events provoke depressive illness or some illness behaviour such as service utilization. Because of these problems it is still not certain that life events cause depressive illness.",

Psychosomatic factors should be given special attention during interviews. For a correct picture to be obtained, the help of a specially trained worker i.e. a psychiatrist or psychologist, should be enlisted. Factors and casual relationships can then be uncovered which remain problems to doctors not thus specialized. The two series dealt with in this study illustrate this clearly. Summarizing the observations made, Menière patients subjected to careful psychic and somatic analysis are found to have a predisposing psychosomatic constitution which, under chronic or acute stress, leads to such somatic manifestations as, in their turn, seem to presuppose a certain somatic predisposition—in this particular case evidently in the ear. Chronic stress seems to impair prognosis, a fact not difficult to understand considering that the mode of reaction depends upon the constitution, which—obviously—is of fairly permanent nature.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

      "abstract": "This article provides a critical review of the psychological and related literature on fatigue resulting in both mental and physical experiences. On one hand, prolonged severe fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in various diseases of different aetiology – psychiatric (e.g. depression), somatic (e.g. some infections) and neurologic (e.g. multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). For instance, fatigue is a main symptom of myasthenia that leads to pathological skeletal muscle weakness. Furthermore, 40 to 90 per cent of individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis confirm they have experienced fatigue, which impairs their cognitive functioning. In both multiple sclerosis and myasthenia, fatigue has not only a physical but also a psychological dimension. On the other hand, fatigue can be seen as an isolated set of symptoms of unknown origin called the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The development of the concept, diagnostic criteria and some strategies of coping with CFS are presented. Various somatic disorders, as well as subjective cognitive and emotional complaints, are common and well documented in patients with CFS. The most typical include depression, as well as problems with concentration of attention, decision-making and reasoning in complex situations. However, general intellectual abilities and higher order cognitive skills are intact. Directions for future research are outlined.",

      "title": "Unspoken trauma: How silent posttraumatic stress disorder fuels rising hypertension",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most extensively researched psychological conditions, known to present with numerous physical symptoms. Among the various dimensions of PTSD, those that manifest more overtly—such as recurring flashbacks and intrusive thoughts—are widely recognized and accepted. However, a less apparent form of the disorder, termed silent PTSD, often goes unnoticed, untreated, and unmanaged in most cases. Unlike traditional PTSD, silent PTSD lacks prominent symptoms like trauma reliving or acute panic episodes. Instead, it operates insidiously, progressively affecting the body through chronic stress and wear on multiple systems. One of the most severe outcomes associated with silent PTSD is its significant role in contributing to the development of hypertension. The relationship between silent PTSD and hypertension is complex and multifactorial, but it primarily stems from the persistent state of stress and arousal experienced by individuals. When this heightened stress persists over extended periods, it leads to chronic hyperactivation of the cardiovascular system. Over time, this hyperactivation overwhelms the body’s adaptive mechanisms, resulting in prolonged stress and, consequently, elevated blood pressure levels. If left untreated, this continuous cycle significantly increases the risk of developing hypertensive diseases. This paper explores how silent PTSD facilitates the onset of hypertension and underscores the critical need for increased awareness about this hidden form of PTSD. It highlights the importance of implementing improved screening methods, particularly in populations frequently exposed to traumatic events. By identifying and addressing silent PTSD early, healthcare professionals can mitigate its long-term health consequences, including its devastating impact on cardiovascular health. Recognizing the subtle yet pervasive effects of silent PTSD is essential to ensure timely intervention and promote better outcomes for affected individuals.",

For many years, personality disorder has been either regarded as a secondary diagnosis that can be forgotten in the presence of another mental disorder, or avoided as the diagnosis gives the impression of untreatability or stigma. What is now abundantly clear is that under-diagnosis of personality disorder represents a disservice to patients and practitioners. It prevents a proper understanding of the longitudinal course of psychiatric disorder and an appreciation of some of the positive aspects of abnormal personality that can be used in treatment. We must no longer bury personality disorder, ostrich-like, in the diagnostic sand.

      "abstract": "Summary: Depression has a major impact on quality of life in patients with epilepsy and is also the main risk factor for the increased suicide rate in epilepsy. The frequency of depressive disorders depends on the severity of epilepsy and the localization of the epileptogenic focus, with a prevalence of ≤50% in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of depression in epilepsy may be difficult because symptoms of depression may be fluctuating, and some symptoms, such as memory complaints, may be misinterpreted as being a consequence of drug treatment or the epilepsy per se. Affective disorders in epilepsy may differ from those seen in patients without epilepsy. A possibility exists that patients with epilepsy will develop a specific interictal dysphoric syndrome related to limbic system dysfunction. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest a bidirectional relation between depression and epilepsy. Depression does not necessarily occur after the onset of epilepsy; the sequence may as well be the other way round, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for both disorders. Classic bipolar disorder type I is rarely seen in epilepsy, and manic episodes occur almost exclusively in the setting of postictal psychosis or after epilepsy surgery. This article explores the clinical manifestations of depressive and manic disorders in epilepsy and the differences from bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: Symptomatology in Drug Induced Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

      "abstract": "One of the challenges in acute stroke management is accurately differentiating between actual ischemic events and other conditions that mimic stroke. In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

      "title": "Dementia: mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological triggering factors in musicians with focal dystonia",
      "abstract": "Focal dystonia is a\n neurological movement disorder which affects the fine motor control of a\n specific body location. In professional musicians, a limb or the embouchure\n involved in playing a musical instrument may be impacted. Focal dystonia in\n musicians (FDM) is characterised by a loss of\n voluntary motor control and can be a career-ending condition. The\n pathophysiology of focal dystonia, which remains incompletely understood, is\n mainly associated with dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, with impaired\n inhibition and dysfunctions of sensorimotor pathways. FDM is triggered by various\n neuropsychological and environmental factors. However the existence of\n psycho-psychiatric comorbidities and their possible impact on and/or\n contribution to the manifestation of FDM remains under-investigated. Recent\n studies have revealed that motor function can be altered as a result of\n psychological or psychiatric conditions, suggesting common neurobiological\n networks. Studies conducted in other forms of focal dystonia have uncovered\n psychiatric or other psychological comorbidities such as obsessions, phobias,\n anxieties and depression, whereas a limited number of investigations with FDM\n patients have mainly indicated elevated levels of anxiety and perfectionism.\n The aim of the current thesis was to provide new insights into the\n psychopathology of focal dystonia and its possible consequences for motor\n performance in affected musicians. The investigation was divided into three\n different studies (chapters), each exploring a different aspect of the\n overall topic.\n The first chapter comprises\n a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the psychological profile of FDM\n patients based on standardised psycho-diagnostic\n instruments. Findings indicate that in comparison to healthy controls, half\n of the FDM patients exhibited elevated instances of psychological traits\n related to anxiety, perfectionism and dysfunctional stress-coping features.\n Furthermore, results suggest that these conditions pre-dated the onset of the\n disease and may have contributed as aggravating risk factors to the\n development of FDM. We suggest that the existence of FDM patients with and\n without psychopathology could reflect different mal-adaptive processes\n mediated via different circuits of the cortico-basal\n ganglia-thalamic loops.\n Most of the features in the\n FDM patients diagnosed with psychopathology were related to elevated levels\n of stress and anxiety. Therefore the second chapter focuses on the design of\n a complex experimental paradigm which examines physiological parameters\n (electro-myography [EMG] and fine motor\n performance) in relaxed and stressful conditions, in combination with\n objective assessments (electrocardiography [ECG], cortisol) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n (HPA) axis. Due to the fact that no similar paradigm has previously been\n implemented for patients with focal dystonia, a pilot study with a small\n number of patients was conducted. Findings suggest that the experimental\n design is feasible and serves its purpose.\n The final chapter\n encompasses a combined design derived from the first two chapters. Possible\n electrophysiological differences were examined i)\n between FDM patients and healthy controls, ii) among FDM patients before and\n after stress and iii) between\n patients with and without psychopathology. Findings indicate that FDM\n patients are characterised by increased sensitivity to psychosocial\n stressors, in comparison to healthy controls. The impact of stress is\n expressed as an increase in muscular co-contraction of the affected hand, which can be\n explained as a “natural” physiological response under stressful conditions. Finally,\n no motor outcome differences are found between patients with and without\n psychopathology, however results indicate that musicians with psychopathology\n had, on average, developed dystonia around a decade earlier than the\n remainder of the patients, emphasising the contribution of psycho-psychiatric\n conditions to the manifestation of dystonia. Summarising, the current\n thesis suggests the existence of psychopathology in about 50% of musicians\n with focal dystonia. FDM patients with and without psychopathology did not\n differ in their motor performance, however there is clear evidence that\n psychopathology can be an aggravating factor, which may accelerate or even\n trigger the manifestation of dystonia. The current thesis supports the\n concept that motor and psycho-psychiatric features share common\n neurobiological networks in patients with focal dystonia.",

Most studies were prospective cohort studies, including those providing the most data about etiology. In some studies, weak methods and analyses limited the conclusions. In addition, the methodologic criteria of the literature search excluded some well-known reports about this subject.Because of the small number of studies, there was inadequate evidence that chronic pain results from a prior psychiatric disorder (level 4a). The studies provided limited evidence (level 3) that chronic depression plays a role in the development of new pain locations (although not for low back pain); that prior nervousness and past negative life events predict work disability; and that depression, anxiety, and a sense that control rests outside of one's own self may predict slower recovery from pain and disability. These findings do not prove that psychological factors have a role in the development of chronic pain. Psychological impairment may precede the onset of pain. Based on current knowledge, it may also arise as a complication of chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "In old age, depression mainly affects those with chronic medical illness, severe disability or mental decline. Depression in elderly worsens the outcomes of many medical illness and increases mortality. Age-related processes, including arteriosclerosis, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, may compromise the integrity of prefrontostriatal pathways and amygdala leading to increased vulnerability to depression. Environmental factors, such as impoverishment, isolation, relocation, caregiving and bereavement, contribute to further increase susceptibility to depression or triggering depression in already vulnerable elderly people. Suitable treatment of depression in elderly reduces the symptoms, prevents suicidal ideation, improves cognitive and functional status and helps patients to develop the skills needed to cope with their disability or psychosocial adversity. Prevention of depression in given pathological conditions may greatly improve the outcomes, mostly the recovery of function and quality of life, as well as the mortality risk. Therefore, it should be considered the opportunity of a depression prophylaxis, particularly in those circumstances in which the risk of depression is noteworthy increased, such as stroke, cancer, institutionalization, etc.",

      "abstract": "The compartment syndrome is an entity of rare appearance in sports, if we compare it with the universe of sports injuries; however, it is important to know it, because it induces an emergency medical consultation in sports scenarios, in acute cases, and incapacitates the athlete in chronic cases. The compartment syndrome is mainly associated with contact or endurance sports and its classification is according to the time of appearance, in acute and chronic by overexertion or according to the body site. In order to detect it in an acute presentation, its signs and symptoms can be classically defined in the 5 P's; however, the chronic compartment syndrome could appear with other associated findings, depending on the committed site, making it easily confused with other processes. This entity should be suspected in every sportsman or woman when pain appears that is exaggerated in the affected extremity or body compartment, compared to the mechanism of the injury and when there are signs in the affected extremity to complete the 5 P's, associated or not to the causes that originate it, and the associated risk factors. If the compartment syndrome is suspected, the intra-compartment pressures of an invasive type must be checked by the attending medical professional and, in order to rule it out from other entities, it is useful to send serum para-clinical tests to check for associated muscle necrosis, together with the taking of imaging tests, if technological care allows it. Always when faced with a compartment syndrome, the associated complications must be considered. Early fasciotomy is the treatment of choice and it is up to the specialist to practice it in the acute compartment syndrome. In relation to the chronic compartment syndrome the activity that is being carried out must be suspended, to treat the patient with other measures that could diminish the process, including powerful analgesia, handling of footwear or of surface to avoid to increase it, analgesics under scales of pain of medical type and until drugs like the botulinum toxin A by expert personnel, but always the handling must be expectant and to watch it by a specialist because it could need surgical handling of definitive form. Specialized evaluation and appropriate decision making by sports training staff in a timely manner can avoid temporary or permanent complications in the affected individual. We hope that this review can raise awareness among all sports practitioners, their counselors, and medical and non-medical personnel for better detection of this complication of sports injuries.",

The emphasis is placed on the very nature of the illness, the causes of the same, the conditions and working conditions on board that cause mental and physical discomfort, as well as the stress that has become a risky factor in the life of a sailor. The aim of this paper is to analyze and study the correlation between long-haul sailors with the occurrence of psychophysical problems and through the work I deal with topics such as working conditions on board, health care, and the main reasons for leaving the ship. The theme that permeates the whole work is the subject of the disease, or an abnormal condition of the body, which hampers normal functioning of the body. Disease is often used to name all the conditions that cause pain, dysfunction (whether physical or psychological), social and other problems, and seafarers are part of a particularly risky group to undergo certain illnesses due to difficult and very stressful work, uneven working hours and other of the overwhelming circumstances of life on board because of which the immune system as well as mental health inevitably suffers.",

      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists attribute great importance to the neuro-insane diathesis as a factor in the causation of insanity, whilst others belittle its influence. The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of PPS and the majority of patients identify fatigue as their most troubling symptom. The aetiology of the symptom arouses great interest, mainly due to its multifactorial character, and can be divided into two components: peripheral (muscular) fatigue and central (general) or simultaneously-occurring fatigue. Considering the importance of the symptom and the limitations that can cause in PPS patients, it is important to consider a series of variables, so that it can be better understood, thus providing a more effective and specific treatment.",

The symptoms of adolescent depression can be the same as those of adults: insomnia, restlessness, withdrawal. Depression in children is not infrequent and its symptoms are manifested more in the body than in a variation in quality of mood. Restlessness, insomnia, lack of engagement in school, and bulimia can be some of the commonest symptomatic manifestations of infantile depression.",

      "title": "Stress An Overview and Ayurvedic Remedy",
      "abstract": "Stress is construed as anything which constitutes a threat- most often perceived-which adversely affect the general well-being of the individual concerned. Modern life , especially in corporate life, stress has become a norm which has been accepted - albeit unwillingly - as a part and parcel of existence. Long and odd working hours, pressure to achieve targets all the time, unhealthy food, non-conducive working environment or even environmental factors like extreme or high altitude could stimulate stress in a person. And prolonged exposure to stress leads to a number of clinical ailments like hypertension, anxiety, depression or on milder scale produces peptic ulcers, Insomnia and host of other ailments. Stress - Sahasa as it is known in Ayurveda - plays an important role in the aetiology of several diseases. The Eustress, positive life stimulant component of stress which helps us in improvement of all round performances - turns to Distress, when this demand for improvement becomes persistent and unmanageable for an individual. As per Ayurveda, stress causes Ojahksaya (Loss of Immunity) making our body increasingly susceptible to various infectious diseases.\r\nOne of the basic tenet of Ayurveda is Prevention is better than Cure. Keeping up with this adage here into the pivotal aim is to keep the onset of stress at bay i.e., negate chances of occurrence of stress and increase the coping capacity of the individual vis-a-vis stress if one become susceptible to it . To avoid occurrence of stress the body should be\r\nprotected by taking adequate care of Diet (Ahara), Sleep (Swapnoh) and Celibacy (Brahmacharyamiti), the three pillars of life. Any deviation in this primal aspects lead to variation of Tridoshas (Vata, Kapha and Pitta- three life supporting variants in the body) making it susceptible to diseases. In case of an unfortunate occurrence of stress (Sahasa), Ayurveda prescribes Lifestyle modification, Dietary interventions and finally Drug treatments. The management aspects of stress is well documented in Rasayana therapy, one of the eight branches of classic Ayurveda. Classical Ayurveda treatment approach to stress demands the patient to be non-violent with a balanced use of his sense organs with self-control and follow a nutritious dietary routine. Drug treatment which constitutes the final phase of the management of stress would only be effective if the above two aspects are followed in letter and spirit. The process aims to balance the vitiated doshas in the patient thereby bringing the patient back to a healthy state of well-being. The stress treatment mainly aim at modulation of immune response in the patient to bail him out of the immunosuppressive actions of the prolonged stress.\r\nTo conclude, as part of the stress avoidance one needs to follow a meditative non-violent life, eating dietarily balanced food. Try to Control your senses and desires and use them consciously. Despite all these measures if one gets caught up in the stress, it is recommended that consciously work up of the lifestyle modification and resort to Rasayana therapy under a well-founded Acharya (Teacher) of Ayurveda.",

Albeit the distinct kinds of stress stated in the aforementioned stress list, it is hard to bring out a clear distinction between them since each stress may precede or succeed the manifestation of any other. The studies discussed in the review elucidate effects of psychological stressors (PS) on diseases such as cancer, AIDS, epidermal abnormalities, obesity, and various inflammatory diseases like colonic inflammations, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), asthma. From these studies, further attempt was made to establish the basic mechanisms which come into play during a stressor stimulus and consequently modulate the physiology of the body. In this review we have highlighted effects of PS on diseases while simultaneously building on the modes of operation of PS to alter physiology and its further implications in developing potential psychotherapeutic methods for disease treatment.",

Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder. If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis.

Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment.

It is precipitated by medical illness, substance intoxication/withdrawal or medication effect. Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited.

Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys the idea that they are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

The Authors report an analysis, based on data of the Pisa Centre, on possible causes of this disorder. The analysis highlights that most of the cases of work-related stress are related to the presence of adjustment disorders and suggests that in many cases this disorder may represent the first step of other psychiatric disorders related to occupational stress.

Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

Perhaps the most important diagnostic judgement in determining the particular kind of depression with which a patient presents has to do with the degree to which the depression has infiltrated the structure of the personality. H. Bleichmar, in a comprehensive review of the different types of depression and the various intrapsychic pathways that lead to their formation, distinguishes between depression that is a component part of many different kinds of disorder and depression as an entity in itself. S. Freud's monumental work on mourning and its relation to clinical depression illuminated how the two conditions–the one usual, ordinary, commonplace, the other pathological–are closely related. This chapter shows that patients with a kind of severe, debilitating depression can be helped with intensive psychoanalytic psychotherapy.",

It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.",

In the psychological sphere, the victim manifests numerous symptoms, such as dissociation, learned helplessness, intrusive dreams and memories, emotional dullness, solitariness, depression, etc. In the social environment, especially in the family, large dysfunction occur. The victim unfavourably affects his or her environment, which at the same time represents, or at least it should represent, the supporting structure in overcoming the difficulties. The victims of PTSD live a difficult life in which each new day represents the beginning of a struggle with oneself. What is considered ordinary and normal, like self-control, sense of security or desire to discover new things, respresents a remarkable effort and hard work to the victims of PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an efficient form of psychotherapy whose effectiveness is proven by numerous clinical studies in the treatments of various psychological disorders. Therefore, the importance of conduction of treatments in order to enable the ill persons to deal with the situation in the easiest possible way is incontestable. With family support, understanding environment, participating in therapies and pastoral models which are provided by the Church and which can be provided with spiritual-psychological assistance, the victim of the disorder can work on himself or herself and thus expect positive steps in dealing with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a state of an individual that results from the interaction of the individual with the environment that is perceived as threatening to the well-being. It is an external constraint which upsets an individual both mentally and physically. Individual in a stressful situation is influenced by his or her mental ability to carry out ongoing tasks. Medical education is highly challenging and often places heavy demands on the mental health of the students. Compared to other fields of education; medical education is evidenced by high prevalence of stress. Educational process exerts an inadvertent negative effect on student’s mental health with a high frequency of depression, anxiety and stress among medical students. Students exposed to work overload and examinations in a competitive environment with constant pressure of assessment brings various changes in their daily habits such as lack of sleep and irregular diet. Mental morbidity is least accounted form of all population health studies and with the threatening rates of mental ill-health and rising rates of deaths due to the lack of early recognition of these morbidities, with not many Indian studies to document this burden. Therefore, the presence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students was assessed using a previously validated and standardized instrument, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) and the associations with their socio-demographic characteristics were identified. The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students and to study the association of stress, anxiety and depression with the socio-demographic characteristics of medical under- graduate students.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder (now also called functional neurological symptom disorder) describes symptoms (of motor and sensory dysfunction such as limb weakness, tremor, visual loss, with or without ‘blackouts’), which can be positively identified as being inconsistent with neurological disease. The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

      "title": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "title": "Outcome Measures for Functional Neurological Disorder: A Review of the Theoretical Complexities",
      "abstract": "The development and selection of optimal outcome measures is increasingly recognized as a key component of evidence-based medicine, particularly the need for the development of a standardized set of measures for use in clinical trials. This process is particularly complex for functional neurological disorder (FND) for several reasons. FND can present with a wide range of symptoms that resemble the full spectrum of other neurological disorders. Additional physical (e.g., pain, fatigue) and psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms are commonly associated with FND, which also can be highly disabling with implications for prognosis, and warrant concurrent assessment, despite an unclear etiological relationship with FND. Furthermore, several unique clinical aspects of FND make it likely that the usual prioritization of \"objective\" (or clinician-rated) over \"subjective\" (or patient-rated) measures might not be appropriate. Self-report measures may be more clinically meaningful in this patient population. Despite being a common and disabling disorder, there has been little research into outcome measures in FND, and to date trials have largely used measures designed for the assessment of other disorders. An international FND Core Outcome Measure group (FND-COM) has been established to develop a consensus battery of outcomes for FND: a \"core outcome set.\" In this perspective article, the authors reviewed the process of outcome measure development and selection before considering the specific features of FND affecting the development of a core outcome set, as well as a research agenda to optimize outcome measurement in this complex neuropsychiatric disorder.",

Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

Such abnormal illness behaviour leads to overuse of health care facilities and contributes to the high cost of health care.

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

The core feature of the disorder is chronic, severe, and persistent irritability that manifests as frequent temper outbursts that are inconsistent with the patient’s developmental level. The temper outbursts can be verbal or behavioral including physical aggression or property destruction. Between outbursts, the child remains persistently irritable or angry for most of the day, nearly every day. These symptoms persist across time and settings and are easily observable by others. Psychotherapeutic interventions including parent training and individual psychotherapy are critical components of a comprehensive treatment plan. Since DMDD is a new diagnosis, there are no published randomized controlled medication trials. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or second-generation antipsychotics may be considered for decreasing irritability.",

These conditions can be distinguished based on the conscious awareness (or lack of awareness) of both motivation and symptom production. Other psychiatric disorders may strongly influence chronic pain without directly causing it-depression, anxiety, panic, and post-traumatic stress disorders.

Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

      "abstract": "Psychosomatic disorders in children and adolescents is a topic that covers a wide variety of illnesses and one which is difficult if not impossible to define accurately. In general, chronic emotional states, often nonspecific, serve as strong contributors to the development of a physical illness. The particular illness is often dictated by varying degrees of biological predisposition in one physiological system—i.e., such a predisposition in the respiratory system may lead to asthma or in the gastrointestinal system to ulcerative colitis. In some cases the biological factor is large and the emotional factor minimal, while in other cases the reverse is true. In the early days of research in psychosomatic disorders it was widely believed that each disorder was accompanied by certain specific emotional problems. Further study has shown this is not true. It was also felt that many, if not most of these disorders could be cured by psychotherapy, and this also has proven to be a fallacy. We have moved more and more to the team approach. Since both psyche and soma are involved, more than one specialist is usually required. In children and adolescents this may involve a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician, an allergist or gastroenterologist, a social worker and a psychologist. It requires time and patience to form an effective and smoothly functioning team in which all members respect one another's potential contribution. Some examples of team operation are presented and some of the problems outlined. In addition, there is attention given to the special problems of the adolescent and also the child with chronic nonspecific physical complaints as well as the child who requires hospitalization.",

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by the development of a set of specific symptoms following a psychologically distressing event that is outside the range of usual human experience. 2. Recovery does not seem to feel as difficult or overwhelming if it is approached \"one day at a time.\" 3. The psychologic damage that occurs in PTSD is due primarily to holding the experiences inside, \"stuffing\" them down through various psychodynamics, or keeping the experiences subdued through addictive behaviors. 4. PTSD among Vietnam veterans is not a mental illness; it is a reaction to extreme stress and a reaction to keeping memories stuffed down and not allowed to surface.",

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

      "abstract": "Joint hypermobility syndrome describes a disorder in which musculoskeletal pain occurs in a generalized joint hypermobility substrate. The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person's lifetime. Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient's physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked. Exploring the patient's articular features in her clinical context led us to diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome, a complex and often ignored condition. The case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach and coordinated interventions to define and manage this clinical entity.",

India's mental health struggles are largely due to societal stigma and inadequate healthcare access. Depression is a major cause of disability worldwide and contributes greatly to the global disease burden. Depression is characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, irritability, guilt, loss of interest, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, physical aches, and thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms can also include increased anger, restlessness, withdrawal, impulsivity, alcohol or drug use, isolation, and difficulties with sexual desire and performance. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common types of depression. It is characterized by changes in neuronal structure and function, which are accompanied by several biochemical changes. It is caused by a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. This review will cover depression, its signs and symptoms, risk factors, mechanisms, and management. The management of depression includes various types of medication, therapies, counselling, stimulation, and strategies to combat depression.",

      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

      "abstract": "Meige syndrome, a rare form of cranial dystonia, manifests as involuntary spasms affecting the facial and neck muscles. Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

In response, we first discuss the nature of the conditions studied and then comment on each issue. Depression is a condition that is only defined when some symptoms are present; there is no truly asymptomatic depression. Thus, to study the morbidity associated with depression, one must identify persons who are actively depressed. Chronic medical conditions, however, are thought to be ongoing, nonreversible, pathological processes with varying symptom presentation. For such conditions, it makes sense to examine morbidity at any phase of the illness; a study based on only symptomatic cases of hypertension, for example, would not be particularly representative of patients with hypertension.

A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III-R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM-IV.",

Auslöser sind durchaus lebenstypische Erfahrungen wie fehlende Beförderung, berufliche Herabwürdigung, Scheidung oder Verlust eines nahestehenden Menschen, die zu einer massiven Verletzung vorhandener Wertvorstellungen führen. Die Störung geht mit einer langen Arbeitsunfähigkeit, unfreiwilligen Klinikaufenthalten ohne eigenes Therapieinteresse, Tendenz zu Chronifizierung und Nichtansprechen auf antidepressive Behandlung einher.

      "title": "The symptom of generalised fatigue",
      "abstract": "What is fatigue? It is a sensation that we all feel at times and which has a variety of synonyms such as tiredness, exhaustion, and weariness.1 In this article we are concerned with a general feeling of fatigue or exhaustion and not with fatigue specific to a part of the body; this is sometimes called central as opposed to peripheral fatigue.2 Although one may interpret a complaint of \"fatigue\" as meaning whatever the patient wants it to mean, it is useful to apply more precision by exploring exactly what the patient means by the term. For example, to differentiate the core concept of fatigue as a lack of ability to initiate or sustain activities because of a feeling of lack of energy, from other meanings such as the \"lack of interest and motivation\" that is typical of depression, and the \"tendency to fall asleep\" that is typical of sleep disorders. When is fatigue abnormal? Fatigue as a symptom must be differentiated from normal tiredness. Given that the severity of fatigue is continuously distributed in the population (fig 1), we need to draw some kind of cutoff to define fatigue of clinically important severity, in the same way that we do for blood pressure and depression. One approach is to define this as fatigue that has persisted for a period of time (say a month or more) and that is of sufficient severity to interfere with the patient's activities or to be otherwise severely troublesome. A patient with fatigue of this severity and duration may then be referred to as \"a case\" of clinically significant fatigue. Figure 1 The distribution of the complaint of fatigue in the population.

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

Psychological problems require the involvement of loved ones. They also require education concerning psychopathology. Sometimes, a situation set the family up in particularly difficult dilemma. Disturbing patient condition, aggressive behavior, hallucination cause that a patient can become dangerous for yourself or others. In this situation, it's very often necessary to take obligatory actions against an ill person. This person claims to be healthy.

      "title": "Animal well-being. III. An overview of assessment.",
      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

The persistent monoideistic preoccupation tends to acquire the quality of a repetitive hypnotic suggestion or \"inner commands\" and creates an altered state of consciousness that transcends the limits of volitional control. The one-sided ideational context permeates interpersonal relations, intensifies family conflict and drains a considerable portion of available psychic energy. Disregard or an incorrect approach to this factor may result in painful therapeutic failure, since no exploratory psychotherapy or verbal intervention technique will be able to penetrate the monoideistic armour. THe continuous repetition of the dominant idea functions as a cumulative suggestion stimulus leading to disruption of spontaneous processes and self-defeating thinking, behavioral, motivational, and affective changes. The monoideistic preoccupation may be total and pervade the individual's entire life. Any comprehensive form of therapy should offer formulations and precise procedures--for the identified patient, nuclear family, and network of significant others--to block the feedback supplying system attached to the monoideistic pattern.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years.

      "title": "Cognitive‐emotional sensitization and somatic health complaints",
      "abstract": "Sensitization is conceptually related to cognitive bias in experimental psychopathology, and they share the basic mechanism of neuronal sensitization. Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

Many family doctors are used to seeing patients who have experienced life events that lead to psychological disturbance. Bereavement can be defined as the period of mourning and grief that follows the death of a loved one. Mourning consists of the rituals and symbolic behaviour that follow such a death. Bereavement is an experience that virtually all individuals will experience at some point in their lives. Key tasks for health-care professionals include the possession of good knowledge about the normal spectrum of bereavement reactions, skills in promoting grieving, and an ability to identify when a grief reaction has become abnormal, prolonged or complex, or when it has developed into a mental illness such as depression.",

Hunger leads to initiation of eating. Eating activates inhibitory signals producing satiety. Satiety is the quality or state of being fed or gratified to or beyond capacity mediated in the short term by mechanical factors related to swallowing and gastric distention, chemical factors related to taste and smell, and psychological factors (sensory-specific satiety) and in the long term by chemoreception of nutrients and gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and neuroendocrine and neuronal factors and is a major motivation for terminating eating (1).",

Further, anxiety may in large part be a reaction to stress, sometimes to stress not recognized as such. It is hard to find the cause of anxiety.

Over time, they lead to an important alteration of daily activities (domestic, social, professional) of the person. At present, with life expectancy continuing increasing all over the world and with 10% of the total world population being over 65, the incidence of neuro-degenerative and affective disorders becomes an important concern for specialists. Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue and history and investigations should always be individualized. Management should initially aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes; however, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered. For optimal management the multidimensional components of fatigue should be assessed and future research is needed on the use of non-pharmacological treatment such as physical activity, counselling, and/or pharmacological agents such as a trial of psychostimulants or short course of corticosteroids.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

Medical illness, especially acute, unexpected illness and injury, can serve as a life-threatening traumatic stressor that precipitates PTSD through multiple mechanisms. PTSD, and even traumatic exposure without subsequent PTSD, may increase the risk of a variety of medical illnesses, with the most-studied illness being cardiovascular disease. PTSD may also worsen the course and outcome of already existing medical illness. Extant research has not addressed the possibility that medical Illness may worsen the course or outcome of PTSD, but similar research has shown only limited effects of medical illness on depression and anxiety outcomes. These reciprocal relationships are thought to exert their effects through mutually reinforcing neurobiological mechanisms as well as through effects on health behaviors.",

In this paper a pragmatic distinction has been made between Primary Study Difficulty and Secondary Study Difficulty, and between various subcategories of the latter. Useful as such a classification may be it remains, like most classifications, somewhat arbitrary and artificial. In any given case it is usually possible to relate a student's presenting complaints to a variety of factors, and to discern a subtle intertwining of cognitive and emotional determinants. The diagnostic and remedial needs of students with such problems are therefore best served by a clinic which involves psychiatrists and psychologists working in close collaboration.",

To an involuntary, profound, unaccountable and especially more or less prolonged state of apparent sleep has always been assigned a certain element of mystery. While the mystery, at least in the transcendental sense, has largely faded, the interest and obscurity remain and there is recognized at present a group of cases with every gradation of intensity between moderately excessive somnolence and a stupor from which no amount of stimulation will arouse the patient; and varying in duration from a few minutes to several months.

      "title": "Depressão puerperal e seu difícil diagnóstico",
      "abstract": "Introdução: O parto é um processo difícil e exaustivo, e no puerpério, a mulher passa por um período de grande vulnerabilidade, associado a intensas alterações físicas e emocionais. A depressão pós-parto ocorre mais comumente 6 semanas após o parto, em cerca de 6,5% a 20% das mulheres. Embora as mulheres que sofrem de tristeza pós-parto tendem a se recuperar rapidamente, a depressão puerperal tende a durar mais tempo e afeta gravemente a capacidade das mulheres de retornar às funções normais. Por ser definida como um transtorno depressivo maior, exigem critérios de diagnóstico, como sintomas de humor deprimido ou a perda de interesse ou prazer nas atividades presentes por pelo menos duas semanas. Além disso, podem estar presentes distúrbios do sono, distúrbios do apetite, perda de energia, sentimentos de inutilidade ou culpa, diminuição da concentração e pensamentos suicidas. O diagnóstico e o tratamento da depressão pós-parto são desafiadores, isso porque as alterações nos padrões de sono e no apetite, além da fadiga excessiva, são rotina para as mulheres após o parto, e nem todo tratamento trará benefícios à paciente. Objetivo: O presente trabalho tem como objetivo evidenciar a importância e o diagnóstico da depressão puerperal. Métodos: Para a confecção desta revisão de literatura, foi realizada pesquisa nas bases de dados Medical Literature Analysis and Retrievel System Online (MEDLINE), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) e Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), além de documentos oficiais do Ministério da Saúde. Na busca, foram utilizadas as palavras-chave “depressão puerperal”, “gestação” e “transtornos psiquiátricos”. Foram aplicados os filtros “revisão bibliografica” e “relato de caso”. A amostra de estudo foi composta por textos em português e inglês com publicação no intervalo entre os anos de 2020 e 2024. Aplicando-se esses critérios, 20 artigos foram pesquisados, dos quais 8 deles foram selecionados. Resultados: Os resultados destacam a prevalência significativa da depressão puerperal em todo o mundo, bem como fatores de risco conhecidos, como história prévia de transtornos mentais, falta de apoio social, eventos estressantes durante a gestação e parto complicado. Além disso, as abordagens de triagem e diagnóstico; intervenções terapêuticas, incluindo psicoterapia e farmacoterapia; e medidas preventivas para reduzir o impacto da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil ainda são controversas e precisam ser individualizadas de acordo com cada paciente. Conclusões: A depressão puerperal é uma condição que tem se tornado cada vez mais comum e que requer atenção cuidadosa por parte dos profissionais de saúde. Estratégias de triagem eficazes, intervenções terapêuticas baseadas em evidências e apoio contínuo são fundamentais para identificar e tratar adequadamente mulheres afetadas por essa condição. Além disso, políticas de saúde pública que promovam o acesso equitativo a cuidados de saúde mental perinatais são essenciais para mitigar os efeitos adversos da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

      "abstract": "Depresivnost je emocionalno stanje koje opisuju osjecaji tuge, neraspoloženja, žalosti, utucenosti i sl. Vecina istraživaca danas definira depresivnost u terminima kontinuuma od normalne, povremene i prolazne žalosti do duboke depresije koja traje ili se stalno ponovo vraca. Danas se procjenjuje da oko 10-15% djece u opcoj populaciji ima znacajno izražene simptome depresije. Psihosomatski simptomi predstavljaju sve one tjelesne simptome koji se javljaju pod utjecajem emocionalnih cimbenika, a ukljucuju jedan organski sustav, obicno pod kontrolom autonomnog živcanog sustava. Simptomi se mogu javiti u rasponu od jednog ili vise simptoma slabijeg intenziteta pa sve do veceg broja vrlo intenzivnih simptoma koji djetetu ometaju svakodnevno funkcioniranje. Razliciti tjelesni simptomi psihogene etiologije koji se javljaju u djetinjstvu i adolescenciji dio su razlicitih klinickih slika (pa tako i depresije), a najcesce se opisuju u kategoriji razlicitih psihosomatskih i somatoformnih poremecaja (APA, 1996). U radu su prikazani rezultati istraživanja koje je provedeno s ciljem utvrđivanja specificnih aspekata depresivnosti koji su povezani s pojavom psihosomatskih simptoma u djece i adolescenata. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 315 ucenika (158 djevojcica i 157 djecaka) od 5. do 8. razreda osnovne skole. U istraživanju su primijenjene dvije skale: Skala depresivnosti za djecu i adolescente SDD (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003) i Upitnik psihosomatskih simptoma za djecu i adolescente PSS (Vulic-Prtoric, 2005). Rezultati provedenog istraživanja pokazuju da ispitanici koji postižu klinicki znacajno izražene simptome depresivnosti imaju i veci broj psihosomatskih simptoma (osobito pseudoneuroloskih, gastrointestinalnih, kardiovaskularnih) te da u vecoj mjeri doživljavaju glavobolje, umor i razlicite oblike bolova. Nadalje, utvrđene su spolne razlike kako u doživljavanju simptoma depresivnosti tako i psihosomatskih simptoma: u usporedbi s djecacima, djevojcice imaju znacajno veci broj simptoma. Zakljucak: Dobiveni rezultati potvrđuju teorijske postavke u razvojnoj psihopatologiji o dvosmjernoj povezanosti depresivnih i psihosomatskih simptoma: depresivnosti kao snažnom rizicnom cimbeniku u razvoju psihosomatskih reakcija, ali i kao posljedici dugotrajnijeg doživljavanja tjelesnih tegoba. Razmotrene su i prakticne implikacije dobivenih rezultata, posebice u planiranju tretmana djece sklone somatizaciji, te depresivne djece i adolescenata.",

      "abstract": "The psycho-emotional state has the most significant effect on the clinical picture and course of diabetes of any type. According to many researchers, it is known that patients with diabetes suffer from depression almost three times more often than patients without it. When the patient has symptoms of depression, his emotional state is disturbed, which quite often leads to the patient's refusal of the prescribed necessary treatment, and eventually decompensation of the somatic state occurs. In turn, it causes new episodes of depression, which requires the use of psychotropic drugs and psychotherapy. A comprehensive clinical-psychopathological and psychodiagnostic examination of 82 patients with type II diabetes of moderate and severe forms was conducted. The average duration of diabetes was (7.9±5.2) years. Emotional disorders are represented by anxious, depressive, astheno-hypochondriac, hysteroform variants of psychopathological symptoms. Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent complication of type II diabetes. It is associated with both the age-related aspect of the disease and the pathological dysmetabolic cascade that forms basis of the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy development. Cognitive decline in type II diabetes has a mixed (vascular-degenerative) nature and is characterized by complaints of decreased working capacity, and is marked by a decrease in memory, auditory-speech and visual modalities, slowing of thinking, decreased concentration of attention, absent-mindedness, inability to focus on performance of a certain task for a long time. The analysis of cognitive functions using the MMSE method showed that the examined patients had mild or moderate cognitive impairments in the form of a decrease in verbal memory, a decrease in the speed of calculation operations, difficulty in orientation, and a decrease in indicators of the perceptual-gnostic sphere.

      "abstract": "Experiencing mood swings after giving birth can last over a longer period of time. Those mood swings are largely the result of hormonal changes and the physical process of recovery after childbirth. The relationship between the mother and her family members, the doctor, and the nurses, as well as their experiences together, are of great importance during pregnancy, giving birth and afterwards. Except for those factors and other risks, which can cause postnatal psychological changes, there are other conditions for postnatal depression to emerge, such as the characteristics of the mothers in terms of dealing with stressful situations, as well as their history of mental illnesses. Psychological changes after giving birth, mood disorders, are manifested in several ways: from the usual mild reactions of sadness, which spontaneously disappear in a few days, to difficult and severe disorders, which require a specialist’s intervention and often the hospitalisation of the mother. In those grave cases, the distorted perception of their child and surroundings can result in the mother harming herself or her child.\r\n Preventing serious troubles, helping the mother after childbirth, as well as recognizing the symptoms and reducing the risks of postnatal distress are responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Trained through education and courses, house visits, clinical examinations before, during and after birth, those primary and secondary medical care professionals continuously participate in the postnatal care of women. It is not only important to insure the healthcare for the mother and child’s physical wellbeing, but also taking care of their emotional needs.\r\n This paper aims to analyse some of the risk factors and prevention of postnatal depression and psychosis, and their connection.\r\n The results of the study performed have shown partial uniformity with other studies. 37% of the women questioned have experienced postnatal sadness and 16% have experienced postnatal depression. However, it has been found that 3% of the female testimonies have shown a postnatal psychosis. Of all the symptoms, the women questioned have selected “feeling tired” and “lack of energy” to the greatest extent. The smallest number have selected recurring “suicidal thoughts” and “thoughts of death”. The results suggest the presence of light and temporary mood swings, but also show a small amount of severe problems, which can be identified as disorders.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of insomnia in men and women at different age periods",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Headaches are getting common among children especially school going children, and it becomes frequent as a child grows older. The results revealed that all patients were having intermittent headache (2-3 months) for the duration of up to 2 years. Headache was not affecting the sleep activity or appetite of the child. The factors initiating the headache included disturbed family patterns, family phobia, differential parenting styles including over expectations or ignoring. The heavy school work lead to fear of studies that in turn affected the attendance and the scholastic performance. To some extent, the surrounding environmental factors also lead to difficulty in social adjustment. These certain issues lead to stress headaches for most of the children almost every day. In no case, any family history of any psychiatric illness, traumas or any such kind of headaches as those of migraine, sinusitis, etc. was understood. It was also seen that in most cases girls were more affected than boys.",

      "title": "Barriers to the diagnosis of depression in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Approximately 50% of people treated for depression receive treatment in primary care settings. However, studies have demonstrated that specific factors interfere with recognition of this disorder in the primary care setting and decrease the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis. Variables that relate to the patient include lack of awareness and understanding of the nature of the disease and its symptoms so that they can be accurately reported to the physician. Variability in clinical presentation and the presence of comorbid medical disorders also make detection difficult. Complaints of physical symptoms confuse the clinical picture. In addition, patients are ashamed to admit to psychological symptoms of depression and fear the stigma attached to it. Interfering factors that relate to the physician include a lack of knowledge about the disease and lack of training in its management that reduce the physician's ability to render a diagnosis and undermine confidence in the capacity to treat the illness successfully. Reluctance on the part of the physician to inquire frankly about depression also plays a role. Barriers that stem from the system include financing of care under capitated systems, other reimbursement issues, time available to care for patients, and continuity of the physician/patient relationship. A variety of tools are available to assist primary care physicians in the recognition and accurate diagnosis of depression. Use of these tools would increase the recognition and effective management of depression.",

Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

      "abstract": "Although depressive and anxious symptoms frequently coexist, clinical studies have tended to separate anxiety disorders from depression. A number of developments are now reversing this trend. One of these developments is the reworking of the concept of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from that of a residual category (anxiety after all other anxiety disorders are removed) to a generalized anxiety syndrome that includes symptoms of mild depression that are less severe than the symptoms of anxiety. GAD is thereby expanded to a broader concept, namely mixed anxiety/depression (MAD). A second major development, however, posits a different definition of MAD: a stable core of subsyndromal symptoms that do not reach the threshold for the diagnosis of GAD or depression, but which, under stress, will decompensate to an overt anxiety disorder or depression.",

Delusional thinking may occur in severe cases. Behaviourally, depression reflects helplessness or appeasement that arise from feelings of inferiority, entrapment, or defeat. Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

      "title": "Myofascial Pain, Fibromyalgia or Fibrositis?",
      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

      "title": "Demoralization",
      "abstract": "It is common for human beings to feel overwhelmed and give up! This phenomenon is usually temporary and short-lasting, and most people bounce back. However, in a small proportion of people, especially those facing challenging life situations, this may be a persistent feeling requiring clinical attention. This is clinically understood as demoralization. According to the Cambridge dictionary, demoralization is understood as the \"process of making someone lose confidence, enthusiasm, and hope.\" Understanding demoralization in medical and psychiatric disorders is very important, as it is highly prevalent and often requires clinical attention. In addition, the clinicians can also feel demoralized in dealing with the stress, and it is often considered a forerunner of burnout.[1] Unfortunately, the majority of the clinicians do not consider the clinical possibilities that are not covered by the recognized nosological systems; hence, these are either ignored or miscategorized. Demoralization is one such clinical condition. The term \"demoralization\" was introduced in the psychiatric literature by Jerome Frank in the context of psychotherapy, irrespective of the psychiatric diagnosis.[2] He described it as a state of mind in which a person is deprived of spirit or courage, is disheartened, bewildered, and thrown into disorder or confusion.[2] The person experiences incessant feelings of subjective incompetency or failures to meet their expectations or those of others and cannot cope and solve the emergent problems. The core problem responsible for demoralization is the inability to cope, leading to feeling trapped and hopeless.[3] Hope is understood as one of the most fundamental aspects of life, and loss of hope precedes death.[3] Although the concept of demoralization was initially described in psychotherapy, later on, it has been understood and evaluated across various medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. In the context of medical illnesses, any physical illness or mental disorder can lead to demoralization. In the context of medical illnesses, demoralization is understood as the feeling of disempowerment (i.e., not able to perform at one's previous level of functioning) and a sense of futility (i.e., a feeling that the condition is never going to improve and hence the dysfunction is going to continue).[4] However, it is essential to note that demoralization in the context of medical illnesses is understood as a dimensional concept, varying from normal reaction to the illness to an impairing clinical phenomenon requiring attention.[4] Over the years, many authors have tried to describe the clinical features of demoralization. They have characterized it by features of anxiety, apprehension, low mood, distress or existential distress, sense of isolation, hopelessness, helplessness, low self-esteem, personal incompetence, loss of purpose or meaning of life, and inability to cope.[4] In terms of clinical characterization, demoralization is distinguished from depression by the presence of hedonic capacity.[3] It is suggested that the primary deficit in persons experiencing demoralization is the sense of incompetence that leads to uncertainty in the direction of action to be followed. In contrast, persons with depression have low motivation to follow any direction, even when they know the appropriate direction of action.[5] As demoralization is not included in the commonly used diagnostic systems in psychiatry, i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases, a group of researchers formed an international consortium and developed the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) to assess the psychological distress that is seen in persons with various physical illnesses.[6] It listed 12 conditions, demoralization being one of them. According to the DCPR criteria, demoralization is characterized by the patient's awareness of having failed to meet their expectations (or that of others) or being unable to cope with some pressing problems; as a result, the patient experiences feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or giving up; the feeling state is prolonged, generalized, and present for at least one month; and the feeling is closely preceded by the manifestations of a medical illness or exacerbation of its symptoms.[4,7] In another effort to characterize the demoralization syndrome, Kissane et al.[8] proposed diagnostic criteria for demoralization in the context of palliative care. This included: The presence of affective symptoms of existential distress, which also include features of hopelessness or loss of meaning and purpose of life; cognitive features of pessimism, helplessness, sense of being trapped, a feeling of personal failure, or lacking a worthwhile future; lack of drive or motivation to cope differently; associated social alienation or isolation and lack of support; persistence of features for more than 2 weeks with fluctuation in emotional intensity and lack of presence of a major depressive or other psychiatric disorder as the primary condition.[9] The development of structured scales has furthered the concept of assessing the phenomenon of demoralization. One of the commonly used scales is the demoralization scale (DS), a 24-item scale that has good psychometric properties and has been translated into many languages (Kissane et al., 2004).[9] The DS focuses on the demoralization state findings focusing on the past 2 weeks. The five factors of DS include dysphoria, disheartenment, loss of meaning and purpose, helplessness, and a sense of failure.[9] Other scales while have been designed to assess demoralization in the research setting include Dohrenwend's Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview-Demoralization Scale (PERI-D),[10] a scale based on the DCPR criteria[11], and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Clinical Scale of Demoralization.[12] Some of the authors consider that these scales assess nonoverlapping aspects or varying stages of demoralization.[5] The PERI-D is a self-report 27-item scale that focuses primarily on nonspecific distress and measures both trait and state demoralization depending on the time frame considered for evaluation. The various dimensions included in PERI-D include sadness, hopelessness-helplessness, poor self-esteem, anxiety, dread, poor self-esteem, psychophysiological symptoms, confused thinking, and perceived physical health.[10] Structured interview based on the DCPR criteria includes 58 yes/no questions, which identifies 12 psychosomatic syndromes, with demoralization being one of them. It assesses demoralization as a state measure, considering the last 4 weeks.[11] In the context of physical illnesses, demoralization has been extensively studied in malignancies.[13,14] A systematic review that included information from 25 studies reported the prevalence of clinically significant demoralization to be 13%–18%.[14] A higher prevalence of demoralization was associated with poorly controlled physical symptoms, poor social functioning, being unemployed, being single, and insufficiently managed depression and anxiety.[14] Some studies also show that demoralization differs from depression.[13] Besides cancer, a high prevalence of demoralization has also been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[15] and patients who have undergone cardiac transplants.[16] Studies that have assessed the prevalence of demoralization using the DCPR criteria among medical patients with DSM diagnosis of adjustment disorder suggest that the prevalence varies from 28.8% to 39%, with the highest rates among inpatients referred to consultation/liaison services.[17] Demoralization has also been reported to be associated with adverse health outcomes, especially in patients with cardiac ailments in the form of a higher risk of cardiac death or rehospitalization,[18] higher episodes of acute rejection in patients with the cardiac transplant.[16] Demoralization has also been a prodromal symptom of cardiac events.[19,20] In patients with cancer, demoralization has also been associated with more physical symptoms, poorer quality of life, and functioning.[9,21,22] The concept of demoralization has also been evaluated in persons with mental disorders. Initial equivalent terminologies include social breakdown syndrome, noted among patients institutionalized for long for their chronic mental illness.[23] In recent years, some studies have also evaluated demoralization among patients with schizophrenia and suggest prevalence rates to be as high as 94%.[24,25] In terms of factors associated with demoralization, available evidence suggests that higher levels of demoralization be associated with better insight, higher self-stigma, presence of psychotic symptoms, lower level of functioning, and suicidal behavior.[26] These preliminary findings suggest that there is a need to evaluate demoralization in patients with mental disorders too. These findings suggest that clinicians should assess demoralization in the context of all the medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. Demoralization can be characterized by any one of the currently available criteria or scales. While assessing demoralization in a medical setting, depression and adjustment disorder must be considered differential diagnoses. Some of the authors have discussed the management strategies for demoralization in the context of medical illnesses. Management of demoralization in the context of palliative care involves providing continuity of care and active management of symptoms, exploring the attitude toward hope and meaning in life, balancing support for grief and promoting hope, encouraging a search for a new or renewed purpose and role in life, cognitive restructuring to address the negative beliefs, providing pastoral and spiritual support, encouraging connection with other and improving the family support, enhancing family support and review of treatment goals in the multidisciplinary team meeting.[8] Other treatment strategies in the context of various medical illnesses include supportive, empathetic listening by the health-care providers and cognitive-behavioral techniques.[27] Other authors emphasize the importance of providing psychological support using good interview skills to discern the existential themes of significant concern in the index patient and address the same.[28]",

Persuasive clinical evidence indicates that anger evokes physiological responses that are potentially life-threatening in the setting of CAD. Finally, emotional stress, anger, or worry have a dominant influence on the severity, frequency, and treatment of angina. The natural history of angina is characterized by episodic variations in the frequency and severity of symptoms coincident with periods of emotional stress. When angina is associated with periods of emotional stress or anger, the angina is not usually a result of progressive coronary disease, but rather is due to an increase in oxygen demand. Appreciation of this concept will help to rule out \"true\" unstable angina due to progressive coronary disease from recurrent angina that results from an increase in oxygen demand related to emotional stress. The former requires aggressive medical or surgical therapy; the latter, a demand-induced angina, responds to beta-adrenergic blockade and a tranquilizer.",

Essential features offunctionaldyspepsia include persistent pain or discomfort above the umbilicus, not associated with or relieved by a change of stool frequency or form, as well as a lack of evidence for inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic conditions. In about 50 % of adults and greater than 70 % of children, the pathophysiology of symptoms of functional dyspepsia is related to abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal motor function, such as delayed gastric and small intestinal transit, decreased gastric accommodation, and gastric dysrhythmia. Diagnostic evaluation should be driven by an index of clinical suspicion based on pertinent red flags in the history and physical examination. A comprehensive treatment approach uses the biopsychosocial model, which involves a combination of educational, pharmacological, psychological, as well as complementary therapies. Determining the patient's most distressing symptom may also help to target particular treatment options and individualize therapy. Follow-up of dyspeptic patients at 6 months to 2 years revealed that 70 % of subjects were either asymptomatic or much improved regardless of the cause; however, the remainder had neither improvement nor worsening of their symptoms despite aggressive medical management.",

      "title": "Fisiopatología del dolor agudo: alteraciones cardiovasculares, respiratorias y de otros sistemas y órganos",
      "abstract": "Introduccion : El dolor agudo constituye una compleja constelacion de experiencias sensoriales y emocionales, relacionadas con respuestas autonomas producidas por dano a estructuras somaticas o viscerales. Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente. Pese al rapido progreso alcanzado en el conocimiento de su fisiopatologia y el desarrollo de novedosas y efectivas tecnicas para su tratamiento, la conducta terapeutica del paciente con dolor agudo es inadecuada.",

Any condition that affects the physical or functional integrity of the brain is likely to impact on some aspect of a person's ability to remember, as successful remembering involves many different interacting cognitive systems, including attention, memory and executive functions. Furthermore, mood disorders such as anxiety or depression, which impair concentration, also reduce the efficiency of memory.",

While a common disorder in the general community, and not surprisingly more prevalent in the sick, depression has assumed over recent decades greater familiarity. The relationship between cancer and depression may be bidirectional. Depression can be an early or occult symptom of a malignancy, and is a common complication of cancer. The symptoms of depression are affective, cognitive and somatic. Depression is best conceptualised as a spectrum disorder, the symptoms ranging from mild to very severe. A correct diagnosis of major depression allows one of the most confident estimations of response to treatment known to medicine. From the clinical perspective a crucial decision is whether/not to introduce biological interventions. A psychological intervention is mandatory, whereas physical treatment interventions should be reserved for moderate and severe depression. Initially psycho-education about depressive disorders is necessary, and indeed this process is really the introduction of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Burnout» is a syndrome consisting of physical and emotional exhaustion resulting from negative self-concept, negative job attitudes, and loss of concern for clients. This theoretical condi- tion tangentially explains the loss of professional efficacy and became a quasi-clinical concept. Nevertheless, burnout questionnaires do not measure loss of professional efficacy. The attribution of this loss remains understudied. Some allege that over 50% of therapists and health workers suf- fer from burnout, but these results warrant scepticism on account of the overlap with loss of moti- vation. A main prodromal factor in the loss of professional efficacy is a loss of motivation or «disenchantment», possibly caused by occupational boredom. A sequence boredom > loss of mo- tivation > burnout means that therapist efficacy loss depends on continuing professional education (CPE) and peer monitoring. Self-monitoring for motivation is important. National professional practice rules should be tuned to these requirements.",

In the present study the features of headaches were investigated in a sample of 58 depressed inpatients, selected according to Feighner's diagnostic criteria. Head pain was found in over 50% of the depressed, with a greater incidence within the psychogenic group. On the other hand headache did not correlate with the nuclear symptoms of depression (depressed mood, guilt, retardation, inadequacy); it correlated with tension and somatic anxiety.

There is increasing research evidence, however, showing the differences between MDD and BD in multiple aspects, such as clinical characteristics and pathogenesis. Here, we summarized the research progress on the heterogeneity of BD and MDD by reviewing Chinese and English literature published in recent years. The main content includes the differences between the both disorders in clinical manifestations, psychological characteristics, genetic factors, neuropathology, and neurochemical metabolism.

On the other hand, besides that depression may be a prodrome of de-mentia, most findings suggest an increased risk for developing dementia in individuals with depression. Overall, depression and dementia often coincide clinically regard-less of the direction or even assumption of causality.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy is indicated when our formulation suggests that our patient's problems are linked to unconscious factors and acute or persistent problems in domains of function. Interpersonal difficulties, distorted self-perceptions, and maladaptive ways of dealing with stress are undoubtedly the complicated end products of myriad factors.

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "title": "The enigma of central sensitivity syndrome in dentistry",
      "abstract": "Central sensitivity syndrome was coined to replace the previously commonly used term of functional somatic syndromes to describe medically unexplained symptoms and conditions that are typically associated with psychological distress. A lack of understanding of pain biology has led to many individuals being inappropriately labeled as having a “psychosomatic” or “functional” condition, implying a psychogenic origin for their complaint. With advances in our understanding of the science of “suffering,” it is now apparent that a distressing experience such as pain is not merely a sensation that is proportional to the level of nociceptive input, but rather an unpleasant experience influenced by emotional, cognitive, and social components.[1] Dentists, and in particular oral medicine specialists, will face the enigma of central sensitivity syndrome, whereby a distressed and desperate patient may present for diagnosis and treatment for his or her complex orofacial complaint. Orofacial diseases and disorders commonly associated with central sensitivity syndrome include chronic myofascial pain, persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical facial pain), persistent dentoalveolar pain (atypical odontalgia), burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), occlusal dysesthesia, and halitophobia. An understanding of central sensitivity syndrome will better prepare dentists to be able to manage these complex cases. Central sensitivity syndrome is best explained within a biopsychosocial context and with concepts of peripheral and central sensitization. In addition, studies have found detectable neurobiological, immune system and neuroendocrine axis changes that explain central sensitivity syndrome.[2] A number of factors are believed to predispose an individual to central sensitivity syndrome, and these include endocrine and neuroendocrine dysfunction, altered autonomic nervous system function, persistent inflammatory or degenerative disorders (nociception), viral illnesses, sleep disturbances, psychosocial distress and stressors including childhood trauma, small-fiber neuropathies, environmental factors such as weather, noise, and chemicals, and medications such as opioids.[3] To use a classic clinical example to illustrate central sensitivity syndrome, a patient may present with the complaint of a hot, burning mouth, however complicated by generalized hypersensitivity to noxious and non-noxious stimuli, sleep disturbances, chronic fatigue, and psychosocial distress.[4] A review of their medical history may highlight the typical conditions associated with central sensitivity syndrome such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, tension-type headache, chronic pelvis pain, interstitial cystitis, and vulvodynia.[5] In such a case, a holistic approach beyond the primary complaint of burning mouth is necessary. To manage patients who present with central sensitivity syndrome, the clinician must be trained to attain a thorough psychosocial history. This should include questions regarding the initiating, perpetuating, and predisposing factors for the complaint. For example, a patient diagnosed with burning mouth syndrome may report the onset of the burning sensation to coincide with the stress of a motor vehicle accident (initiating factor). However, with further questioning, it is deciphered that the patient has severe depression, history of panic attacks, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies that are likely perpetuating the condition (perpetuating factors). With good clinician–patient rapport, it becomes apparent that the patient has a long history of psychosocial distress that dates back to being sexually abused as a child (predisposing factor). Therefore, for a clinician to successfully treat a patient with central sensitivity syndrome, treatment must also be targeted toward psychosocial factors that may be contributing to the complaint. This must include questions on the behavioral aspects such as sleep disturbances and diet (caffeine, alcohol, drugs), the social aspects such as the effects of the pain on daily function, presence of support systems and dependencies, stigma and access to medical care, and the emotional aspects such as depression, anxiety, symptom reporting, catastrophizing, and fear avoidance. Currently, dental students are trained to manage dental disease based on a cause-and-effect model with little discussion regarding psychosocial factors. Hence, the time has come for a shift in the paradigm in this education model, so patients with central sensitivity syndrome may be diagnosed and treated appropriately.",

      "abstract": "Modern psychiatry uses a theoretical concept of ‘disorder’: it describes various impaired functions without distinguishing pathological disorders from non-pathological disorders, or even from disorders similar to an illness. Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior. Where, in these states, are the borders that demarcate full responsibility from substantially reduced social responsibility?",

      "abstract": "The occurance of psychic changes in the midwifery period is increasingly common. Mental changes can manifest as mild difficulties, but also as serious psychiatric disorders that require treatment. Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate. The role of a health visitor, throught her education and advice, can prevent and identify certain difficulties in a timely manner is crucial and of great importance.",

      "title": "Psychological and Psychiatric Triggers and Risk Factors for Stroke",
      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

Affects, moods or emotions are psycho-physiological states which tend to augment or decrease pathophysiological states. 2. The interaction of pharmacological agents with certain affects or emotions may be synergistic or antagonistic. 3. A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession .

      "title": "Hypochondriasis (Health Anxiety) Reformulated: Similarities With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in A Routine Setting Single Case",
      "abstract": "Despite its long documented history, Hypochondriasis remains a ubiquitous enigma to virtually all health care disciplines and providers. Because such highly health anxious patients are not commonly open to psychological (i.e., non-medical) interpretations of their physiological symptoms, sufferers ironically often become fixed on a pathological quest for physical and/or medical explanations for their problems. This pervasive worry and worry-based behavioral pattern perpetuates and reifies the belief that one hasor will developa serious medical condition, and, due to its inappropriate fixity on perceived organic (versus psychic) etiology, leaves such excessive doubt largely untreated. Therefore, continual high medical utilization and costs persist, and profound human suffering goes largely unchecked and unmanaged. Collectively, this sad, but very real condition and circumstance is unacceptable. Fortunately, this oft recalcitrant and thorny phenomenon has recently been construed as perhaps being similar to another such condition, namely Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If this resemblance is more than a surface relationship, and the two phenomena are indeed related on a process level (i.e., the two share a common pathological core), then Hypochondriasis should be treatable via a specifically tailored treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Since Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been far more responsive to intervention than Hypochondriasis, as its central mechanism of pathology is now well understood (i.e., intolerance for uncertainty), it would be conceivable that Hypochondriasis is in actuality far more treatable than its current riddle-status would otherwise suggest. Indeed, if the two prove to be quite similar, if not outright forms of one another, then there would be far more hope that patients who suffer with this can be helped. This stirring hypothesis was tested by treating a particularly refractory, chronic and severe case of Hypochondriasis with a specialized Generalized Anxiety Disorder treatment package. “Joe” responded quite favorably to treatment, and obtained meaningful change according to Jacobson and Truax’s (1991) method for determining clinically significantand reliablechange. In fact, according to their most restrictive standard, Joe could be labeled “Recovered” at the end of treatment, and at all 18-month follow-up points. His response, caveated around single case generalizability limitations, suggested that perhaps Hypochondriasis does indeed share a common etiological source, namely intolerance for uncertainty, with Generalized Anxiety Disorder; if so, then that would be highly explanative of the strong results. Recommendations are given for conceptualizing pathological forms of health-related fears as just that, a concrete form of an anxiety disorder rather than a Somatoform condition.

      "abstract": "Most studies of the course of schizophrenia cannot easily be compared because of differences in diagnostic criteria and measures of outcome. Both major clinical elements, the productive symptoms and the signs of deficit, seem in part to be reactive to the degree of stimulation in the psychosocial environment, though such factors by no means explain all their variability. The negative impairment tends to antedate florid onset and is a better predictor of social outcome than the florid symptoms. There is, however, no firm evidence that deterioration (deficit inevitably increasing with time) occurs. Manfred Bleuler's formulation summarises the overall outcome of a substantial part of what most clinicians who do not include a chronic course as part of the diagnosis call schizophrenia. About 20–25% recover, about 20–25% remain severely impaired throughout, the remainder run a fluctuating course.",

A growing body of evidence suggests this is a biologically distinct subtype of depression.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) includes atypical features as a parenthetical modifier for depressive illness. According to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (\"atypical features\" specifier), the disorder is primarily characterized by 2 or more of the following symptoms as predominant features in patients with major depression or dysthymic disorder: overeating, oversleeping, \"leaden paralysis,\" and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Patients also show mood reactivity in response to actual or potential positive events. Despite aspects of the disorder resembling a maladaptive, persistent mode of behavior, patients diagnosed with depression with atypical features demonstrate a good response to antidepressant treatment.",

      "abstract": "States of agitation are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations. Very often it is a question of a slipping expression of strong affects like fear, anger, pain and of excessive, reactive performances like flight, defence etc., which are built on top of the affects. Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of agitation; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by intense fatigue, with duration of over six months and associated to other related symptoms. The latter include asthenia and easily induced tiredness that is not recovered after a night's sleep. The fatigue becomes so severe that it forces a 50% reduction in daily activities. Given its unknown aetiology, different hypotheses have been considered to explain the origin of the condition (from immunological disorders to the presence of post-traumatic oxidative stress), although there are no conclusive diagnostic tests. Diagnosis is established through the exclusion of other diseases causing fatigue. This syndrome is rare in childhood and adolescence, although the fatigue symptom per se is quite common in paediatric patients. Currently, no curative treatment exists for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. The therapeutic approach to this syndrome requires a combination of different therapeutic modalities. The specific characteristics of the symptomatology of patients with chronic fatigue require a rapid adaptation of the educational, healthcare and social systems to prevent the problems derived from current systems. Such patients require multidisciplinary management due to the multiple and different issues affecting them. This document was realized by one of the Interdisciplinary Work Groups from the Institute for Rare Diseases, and its aim is to point out the main social and care needs for people affected with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For this, it includes not only the view of representatives for different scientific societies, but also the patient associations view, because they know the true history of their social and sanitary needs. In an interdisciplinary approach, this work also reviews the principal scientific, medical, socio-sanitary and psychological aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the most significant and widespread medical and social problems in the world and it is the etiological factor in 80% of diseases. In the modern world any person is subject to the influence of stress, regardless of the age and gender differences, culture and social status. Stress is a non-specific reaction of the body to the extreme impact of various factors - stressors. As stressors can be: emotional, social, physical, informational and other factors. In functional and morphological terms, stress is manifests itself as a general adaptation syndrome which mobilizes the body’s resources in order to maintain homeostasis. Stress is characterized by staging. The early period of stress is manifested by transient anxiety, with a decrease in body resistance – it is the first stage of the adaptation syndrome. The second stage of stress is characterized by the functional tension of the body’s systems and adaptation to new conditions. In the case of prolonged stress, the body’s reaction becomes pathological, with the depletion of adaptive reserves and the failure of protective mechanisms. At this stage is increase a vulnerability to any stressors. There is a further violation of the consistency of vital functions, and persistent anxiety is formed. In overwhelming majority of cases, stress-induced anxiety is develop of psychovegetative syndrome. In the case when combined the strategies of coping (it is the second stage of the reaction to stress - the stage of resistance) with stress and if it is interrupted at an early stage, in such a way the somatic symptoms are also interrupted at the stage of autonomic dystonia syndrome. When the persistent stress is, we have a development of the third stage – exhaustion. And against the background of limited adaptive reactions, there is a psychosomatic pathology. The above determines the need for early detection of psychovegetative syndrome and its timely treatment. The optimal choice is the appointment of combined drugs for stress, which have anti-anxiety, sedative and hypnotic effects. The combination of phenobarbital and ethylbromisovalerinate is one of the highly effective and widely used for the relief of stressinduced anxiety and manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, reducing the risk of developing psychosomatic pathology.",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

      "abstract": "Many conditions in psychiatry cannot be separated from normality/healthy states (e.g. depression) but even these broad diagnostic constructs may include syndromes like melancholia. There is still a debate as to whether psychotic-like experiences in the community are on a continuum with psychotic symptoms in those meeting diagnostic criteria for psychosis diagnostic constructs. Schizophrenia may exist on a continuum with related conditions (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder). There are differences between people meeting criteria for schizophrenia and healthy controls but none that can be used as a diagnostic test to separate the two, with the possible exception of anomalous self-experiences differentiating schizophrenia spectrum conditions from healthy controls and other diagnostic constructs. Several general medical conditions also exist on a continuum with health with no zones of rarity (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes). Thresholds to meet criteria for these diagnostic constructs are chosen by expert committees often based on risk of developing complications (e.g. myocardial infarctions) and/or whether medical intervention may be beneficial. Even reasonably objective investigations can give abnormal results in healthy people. Concerns about whether thresholds are too low, leading to over-diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, and iatrogenic harm, also exist in general medicine. Other classifications in mental health will need to use thresholds in order to fulfil functions such as administration, research, or access to services. Dimensional classifications are good at representing the many spectrums of mental health.",

      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil.

Anxiety and Depression are one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases. These diseases causes physical and pathological changes in the body, oral cavity not being a exception. Since oral mucosa is extremely reactive to emotional influences like stress, anxiety and depression; oral diseases may arise as a direct expression of emotions, or indirect result of psychological alterations [1]. The mouth is a window to body’s health and oral health state can offer lot of clues about the overall health and sometimes the first sign of a disease shows up in mouth. So there is need to learn more about the intimate connection between oral and overall health. Thus this review highlights the significance of increasing psychological factors in society resulting in altered physiological responses causing orofacial region pathologies, struggles in handling such patients and challenging treatment plans with highly important role played by recognition of such patients with role of counseling and early referral in patients to psychiatrist [2].",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

Insomnia disorder is the diagnostic term for the symptom of insomnia that merits specific attention.

Lansia yang mengalami depresi cenderung tidak menunjukkan gejala afektif dan lebih cenderung menunjukkan perubahan kognitif, gejala somatik, dan kehilangan minat dibandingkan lansia yang lebih muda. Hal ini juga sering disalahartikan sebagai efek dari penyakit multipel dan obat-obatan yang digunakan untuk mengobatinya. Faktor risiko yang menyebabkan depresi pada usia lanjut adalah kerentanan genetik, penurunan kognitif, perubahan neurobiologis yang berkaitan dengan usia, insomnia, dan peristiwa yang membuat stres.

Backache is often persistent or recurrent. It is an indication for careful diagnostic history, physical examination, and adequate roentgenograms. Obesity and poor posture may be contributing causes. Other causes of backache should be considered in differential diagnosis. Backache of mechanical origin can be relieved in the vast majority of cases by suitable protective measures, by correction of obesity or faulty posture, by appropriate trunk-muscle exercises, and by training in good posture. Backache unrelieved by these treatments, especially if there is a severe structural defect, for example, spondylolysis, may be relieved by spine fusion. Sciatica is also a common cause of disability. Severe persistent sciatica is commonly due to protrusion or extrusion of the nucleus pulposus with pressure against the adjacent nerve root, and it may be associated with neurological signs of nerve-root pressure. Tumor of the cauda equina is considered in differential diagnosis. Partial or temporary relief may be obtained by bed rest for two or three weeks if sciatica is due to mild nerve-root pressure. Severe or persistent sciatica due to extrusion of a nucleus pulposus is best relieved by careful surgical removal of the material causing the pressure. The best permanent results are obtained by removal of the entire nucleus pulposus. Spine fusion at the same time will relieve the backache that usually precedes and accompanies disc rupture and will correct structural weakness in the lumbosacral region. Careful evaluation of the patient, meticulous surgical technique, adequate postoperative care, and an appropriate convalescent regimen are essential for a high percentage of good or excellent results.",

Ascribed and prescribed, mental illness diagnoses and experiences vary based on medicalized norms. Medicalization of mental illness occurs via three main authoritative professions: psychiatry, psychology, and clinical social work. The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common. Madness experiences deserve attention, in the workplace and beyond.",

Amplification of associated medical and cognitive difficulties together with a substantial decline in overall productivity are also hallmarks of mood disorders in late life (Lavretsky and Kumar, 2002; Lebowitz et al., 1997). While major depressive disorder (MOD) is the best recognized and characterized depressive syndrome in the elderly, other depressive syndromes and subsyndromal disorders are also associated with significant functional impairment and disability (Beck and Koenig, 1996; Beekman 1997; Geiselmann and Bauer, 2000; Judd et al., 1996; Koenig et al., 1997).

It may be accompanied by a tormenting restlessness, in which every single decision is excruciatingly hard. Depression is an umbrella term for many conditions, such as having a difficult personality that makes you perpetually unhappy, or suffering from a deadly episodic illness. The chapter talks about experiences with bouts of depression and medication and the use of alternative remedies and therapies.",

A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient’s pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.",

We wish to develop this idea to prove that eclampsia is a distinct disease, with a definite pathologic picture, that at times convulsions prove the constant feature, but not invariably so. We may have eclampsia with a typical picture without convulsions. In such cases the eclamptic seizure is manifested (1) by a headache of agonizing, blinding type, in which the patient may become unconscious from the pain; or (2) perhaps as a burning substernal pain, which is, in our experience, an almost constant feature",

      "title": "The Contribution of Demoralization to End of Life Decisionmaking",
      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists believe that syndrome is a diagnosable cognitive disorder characterized in its extreme form by morbid existential distress. If they are right, then it should be an important part of our thinking about end of life decisionmaking. A demoralized patient would be unable to think reliably about the remainder of her life, and therefore incompetent to decide to commit physician-assisted suicide. The pointlessness of a wretched existence, in which meaning and purpose are lost and despair is pervasive, can lead to a wish to die. This mental state may develop in association with the suffering of the chronically medically ill and of the dying. Should a plea to hasten dying be viewed as a rational request for merciful assistance, or is it symptomatic of a suicidal mind disordered through illness and warranting a therapeutic response? Out of the clinical and ethical debates about end of life decisionmaking, a fundamental question has arisen: is demoralization no more than a comprehensible human and emotional response to a state of dire bodily disease, or can it be a pathological process deserving of diagnosis as illness? In this paper, I explore demoralization as a dimensional state of mind--that is, as a mental state ranging from a normal response to perceived helplessness to a morbid form of existential distress. The impact of demoralization upon a person's capacity to give informed consent across a range of end-of-life decisions is a pivotal question. Demoralization influences a person's assumptive world and may, as I shall show, interfere with his appreciation of clinical data pertinent to decisionmaking. Clinical and legislative implications arise when severe demoralization is recognized as a morbid state of mind. Acceptance of Dying No argument exists concerning the capacity of people to accept rationally the reality of their death. Indeed, sociologists have described this as a quest of the modern palliative care movement: to help patients face their dying with open awareness and courage, the 'ideal' of a heroic death in the supportive care of their family, friends, and community. (1) This acceptance of dying is commonly identifiable within the narrative of many patients, especially the very elderly, as they anticipate what their future might hold. The following clinical account helps to illustrate their mental state. Giuseppe, a married, seventy-five-year-old Italian, suffering from lung cancer and recurrent chest infections, caused his oncologist concern when he expressed a wish to die. He appeared very sad as he spoke of his limited future, his frustration at a considerably restricted exercise tolerance, and the boredom that set in at home. He was the youngest of three children born to a farming family in Northern Italy, his education cut short by the onset of World War II when he was just fourteen. After serving in the army, Giuseppe traveled to France where he married and fathered two daughters. In the 1960s, the family migrated to Australia, where Giuseppe worked as a leading hand in the building industry until retirement a decade ago. He was proud of the respect he had earned for his contribution to the workplace, and especially of his family--the very best! He delighted in completing the crossword puzzle daily. While volunteering an acceptance of his diagnosis, he described waves of sadness that came over him when he thought about his life ending. Yet when conversing more generally, he was interactive, spontaneous, could share a joke, and his mood was dearly reactive to the environmental context. His interest in sport and classical movies sustained his enjoyment of life. There was no hint of a clinical depression. Acknowledging that his health was considerably compromised, he explained that he did not want to go on living with illness. He stated, My chest is no good at all. I don't know about my future. …",

Die Therapie sollte symptomorientiert erfolgen, da günstige Effekte auf harte klinische Endpunkte aus randomisierten Studien bisher fehlen.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Names of the “mood disorders” have changed repeatedly, and the layperson is generally confused about their meaning. The mood disorders we will discuss are: depression or unipolar depression, manic-depression or bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder, and cyclothymic disorder. There are two major types of depression. In the first, depression or unipolar depression, the patient’s mood varies between being either normal or depressed; he or she never becomes excessively elated. In the second, manic-depression or bipolar illness, the patient’s mood varies between being depressed (as in unipolar depression) and being “high” or “euphoric.”",

Whereas Fibromyalgia (FM) include symptoms such as aches, pain, stiffness and powerlessness in the muscles, fatigue, exhaustibility, headache, swelling, numbness, bowel problems, and sleeping difficulties Sometimes, fibromyalgia patients report anxiety, tension, insomnia, and depressive mood, while some patients reported psychiatric disorders such as major depressive and anxiety disorders. Fibromyalgia (FM) often categorized, as a ‘functional somatic syndrome’, or sometimes, ‘somatization disorder’. Both CFS and FM share the symptomatology to a large extent. Patients with fibromyalgia also meet the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome whereas individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome also manifest concurrent fibromyalgia. In absence of any biomedical test or a stable physiological marker, researchers also conceptualize chronic fatigue syndrome as a psychiatric disorder, or manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as somatization disorder. The present paper is a review of the studies conducted in the area to understand the nature, clinical picture and causal factors for these conditions. It is also aimed to provide the information about the underlying mechanism of CFS and FM to counsellors to incorporate this body of knowledge while counselling with the similar kind of problems.",

      "abstract": "El dolor es una manifestacion clinica frecuente cuyo tratamiento esta lejos de ser optimo, aunque en los ultimos anos se han producidos avances muy significativos. A esto hay que sumar el hecho de que el dolor suele acompanarse de otras enfermedades comorbidas entre las que destacan la depresion, la ansiedad, el deterioro cognitivo y las alteraciones del sueno. Los antidepresivos son farmacos frecuentemente utilizados en el tratamiento del dolor, bien solos o en combinacion con otros analgesicos. Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY We have carried out this research because accidents are a serious public health problem in Mexico. They are the third overall mortality cause and the first among young adults. In addition, in our country, the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been focused sufficiently on accidents, not to speak of motor vehicles accidents. Among the different types of accidents, traffic accidents are placed at the top of the list. Aside from causing injuries and the loss of man hours at work, these accidents bring about emotional distress to affected individuals. Stress is a factor that triggers short-and medium-term consequences which are in turn reflected in the quality of life of the patient and his/her family. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that causes psychosocial disfunctioning and appears due to the exposure to a stressor or traumatic event. It may come about in two ways: when the subject is a victim of a serious threat to his/her life or integrity and when the subject witnesses an event seriously affecting a third party. The main stressors may be natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, intentional attacks, such as rape or any form of criminal violence, and, as is the case here, from traumatic events caused by motor vehicles. The etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial and involves genetic, psychological, educational, and environmental aspects. It has three forms: severe, where the disorder appears immediately after the occurrence of the event or until a month later; chronic, lasting between one and three months; and delayed, where symptoms appear six months after the event. Our objective was to establish PTSD frequency in patients with physical injuries caused by motor vehicles accidents who were attended at the Regional Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital “Adolfo Lopez Mateos”. Together with the application of the scales, we were interested in making a description of the sociodemographical side of accidents, comparing the affect profile, and somehow defining the wide range of factors involved in the occurrence of this problem. For this, we devised a transversal and descriptive study with a non-probabilistic sampling. The sample was chosen using the following inclusion criteria: a)Being older than 18 years.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The recent resurgence of the notion of psychosomatic disorders, grouping together as 'medically unexplained symptoms' all those without organic diagnosis and associated with distress, has included all chronic (persistent) pain within its remit. As pain is reasonably well explained, within an integrated biopsychosocial model, critical analysis of the position is required. Recent findings Neuroscientific and translational studies of pain mechanisms have strengthened the understanding of pain, providing stronger connections between abstract psychological concepts corresponding to observation and studies of human clinical populations, neuroscientific findings in clinical and analogue studies, and animal research. This situation is contrasted with even the most recent reviews of medically unexplained symptoms providing only vague and patchily supported mechanisms, with little cognate human analogue or animal research. Summary The implication of subsuming chronic pain under medically unexplained symptoms is that the primary care/community physician will try to persuade the patient that the symptoms indicate underlying depression, which her or she may offer to treat. When pain is instead recognized as a problem in its own right, it would be referred for specialist opinion and care, or treated directly with evidence-based pain interventions.",

      "abstract": "Depression er en hyppigt forekommende psykisk lidelse, som forbindes med en lang række psykiske og fysiske symptomer. Disse symptomer kan påvirke dagligdagen i væsentlig grad og er typisk kendetegnet ved sænket stemningsleje, nedsat lyst eller interesse samt nedsat energi og øget trætbarhed. En stor andel af personer med en depressiv lidelse oplever ydermere udtalte vanskeligheder inden for det sociale domæne. For enkelte psykiatriske lidelser er sociale og interpersonelle vanskeligheder selvstændigt medregnet som et diagnostisk kriterium; fx inden for autismespektrumforstyrrelser. Dette er ikke tilfældet for depression, der ikke desto mindre ofte er kendetegnet ved betydelige og fremtrædende vanskeligheder inden for det samme domæne. Personer ramt af depression isolerer sig, oplever mindre glæde, og ofte udspiller der sig et større konfliktniveau i kontakten med deres nærmeste (Hirschfeld et al., 1999; Weightman, Knight, &amp; Baune, 2019). Den deprimerede persons sociale vanskeligheder er belastende i sig selv og øger samtidig risikoen for tab af social støtte, hvilket i sig selv kan udgøre en barriere for bedring i tilstanden. Det er bl.a. af disse grunde vigtigt at opnå indsigt i de kognitive mekanismer, der kan ligge til grund for hhv. adaptiv og maladaptiv social adfærd. Kognitiv svækkelse optræder typisk også i forbindelse med en depressiv episode, og talrige studier har dokumenteret vanskeligheder inden for en række kognitive domæner, herunder psykomotorisk tempo, opmærksomhed, hukommelse, indlæring og eksekutive funktioner (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, &amp; Blackwell, 2013). Socialkognitive vanskeligheder er anerkendt som et fremtrædende symptom ved en række psykiske lidelser, herunder autismespektrumforstyrrelser og skizofreni (Fernandes, Cajão, Lopes, Jerónimo, &amp; Barahona-Corrêa, 2018). I hvilket omfang samme type af deficits ligeledes er af betydning ved depression, har igennem en årrække stået mindre klart. Der er dog nu en voksende anerkendelse af socialkognition som et værdifuldt konstrukt i forståelsen af kognitive forstyrrelser ved depression og i forbindelse med velkendte psykosociale vanskeligheder ved samme. En introduktion til socialkognition vil blive givet i det følgende efterfulgt af en præsentation af fund inden for unipolar depressiv lidelse.",

The early psychoanalytic formulations of Abraham<sup>1</sup>and Freud<sup>2</sup>of the depressive reaction long ago became identified with the notions of self-accusation, guilt, and selfdestruction, so that nearly every depressive reaction was viewed either as resulting from or including the turning of the original object-directed aggression against the self, or from the internalized aggression against the incorporated loved and hated object. In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings. One more recent psychoanalytic position<sup>3</sup>is that depression is associated with denial, or repression of aggression, aimed at preserving the original love object",

Affected patients often present with multiple oral complaints, including burning, dryness and taste alterations. Burning mouth complaints are reported more often in women, especially after menopause. Typically, patients awaken without pain, but report increasing symptoms through the day and into the evening. Conditions that have been reported in association with burning mouth syndrome include chronic anxiety or depression, various nutritional deficiencies, diabetes and changes in salivary function. However, these conditions have not been consistently linked with the syndrome, and their treatment has had little impact on burning mouth symptoms. Recent studies have pointed to dysfunction of several cranial nerves associated with taste sensation as a possible cause of burning mouth disorders. The most common central mechanism that likely explains burning mouth disorders is a centrally mediated continuous neuropathic pain. Given in low dosages, benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be effective in patients with burning mouth disorders.",

      "title": "The Relationship between Depression and Chronic Pain: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Considering the relationship between depression and chronic pain as a crucial aspect of physical and mental health, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive literature review to analyze this association. Depression, a complex psychiatric disorder, is characterized by symptoms such as depressed mood, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and loss of interest in daily activities. On the other hand, chronic pain is a debilitating condition that persists for at least three months, compromising the processing of painful stimuli in the central nervous system. Scientific studies have shown a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic pain, as well as the presence of chronic pain in individuals with depression, suggesting a possible cause-and-effect relationship. Biopsychosocial mechanisms, including chronic stress and neuroendocrine alterations, are involved in this complex connection. This comorbidity negatively impacts patients' quality of life, requiring comprehensive therapeutic approaches that involve pharmacological treatments, psychotherapeutic interventions, physical therapy, among others. Understanding the interaction between mood disorders and chronic pain is essential to improve clinical approaches and provide greater well-being to affected individuals.",

Because this ubiquitous symptom has remained so long a mystery, any discovery or theory concerning its mechanism and alleviation is even more intriguing. We know pain exists, but we may be unable to find its cause. If we do find the cause, there may be no correlation between the extent of disease and the degree of patient suffering. A condition that causes excruciating pain in one person may be completely tolerable to another. Even if the cause is removed, suffering may continue. Pain is entirely subjective, but we know it exists when we see the distressed patient. We cannot see the pain, but we recognize its presence in facial expression, verbal description, body language, and objective clinical signs (eg, pallor, rapid pulse, sweating, and others). The patient may feel that he must convince us of its reality, but",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

There is a high association of co-morbid medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial disorders, as with chronic pain in general. Attention to history, especially onset and aggravating factors, can be crucial in identifying the etiology. Physical examination, including neurological and myofascial exam, can often provide important clues to identifying the most appropriate treatments. Many of the chronic facial pain syndromes are unique, given the complex anatomy and specialized sensory innervation of the head, face, and neck, and often pose diagnostic challenges. Due to the host of therapies available for facial pain it is imperative for the clinician to guide patients through therapeutic options to maximize treatment efficacy.",

The relatively new diagnoses burnout, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome probably represent different ways of reacting to an overwhelming situation. The boundary between these diseases, on the one hand, and depression, heart disease or infarction on the other is often diffuse, and the new diagnoses may well delineate preliminary stages of more serious diseases such as angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. There is evidence that also other causes of death may be related to stress. These circumstances reflect not only considerable suffering on the part of individuals, but also a substantial economic burden for society.",

Brief questioning concerning these conditions can be performed relatively quickly during the clinical evaluation. Second-source information should be obtained when at all possible. If treatable psychiatric illness is identified in those with premenstrual tension, it should be treated as if the psychiatric syndrome alone were present.

      "abstract": "The word depression comes from the Latin word deprimere which means to press/ imprinted. It is one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses and a major public health problem. Depression can be described as an emotional state manifested by low mood, loss of interest and satisfaction, guilt and low self-esteem, sleep and appetite disorders, loss of energy and poor concentration. Depression in adolescents is very similar to depression in adults, but key differences are found in the extent, severity, and impact of symptoms. A depressed child cannot function normally or perform his or her school obligations. Depression has been found to occur as a result of the interaction of a number of biological, psychological and social factors. Te most important biological factors responsible for the development of depression include genetic inheritance and neurochemical changes in the brain, psychological personality, ie the temperament of the person and socially stressful life events. Te International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) are most commonly used in diagnosing depression. Due to the increased risk of suicide, it is necessary to assess and monitor the signs of suicidal thinking and behavior in young people with depression in clinical practice. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition), depressive disorders can be divided into: disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major depressive disorder, dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and depressive disorder causa by psychoactive substances / drugs. Te main goals of treating depression in adolescence are: to reduce and eliminate depressive symptoms, to restore the functionality that was before the disease, and to prevent recurrence. Treatment requires a multimodal approach, and it includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, in severe cases, pharmacotherapy. Te combination of psychopharmaceuticals and psychotherapy has the best effect in severe cases. To provide quality health care, a nurse must be well educated, and to provide appropriate care, knowledge of the symptoms that determine depression is essential. In her work, the nurse should respect the most important principle of patient care, and that is a holistic approach. This means that the patient should be viewed as a whole being taking into account his basic human needs, biological integrity, and social and cultural environment.",

      "title": "The nature of neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression: a controversial issue in contemporary psychiatry.",
      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression have been regarded, by many authors, as relatively specific markers of nosological subtypes of the disorder, e.g. primary vs. secondary, endogenous vs. non-endogenous or unipolar vs. bipolar depression. They should reflect the same changes in central neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenergic insufficiency and/or cholinergic hyperactivity) that were hypothesized as the cause of clinical symptoms. This view is challenged on the basis of our own neuroendocrine investigations in 317 psychiatric patients and 103 normal controls. According to these studies the abnormalities are nosologically rather unspecific. They are induced by a large variety of factors, e.g. emotional stress associated with the clinical symptomatology, weight loss due to malnutrition as a consequence of reduced appetite, medication and drug withdrawal. Stress-induced hypercortisolism appears to be the most common abnormality that may trigger other neuroendocrine dysfunctions, such as a blunted TSH response to TRH. Differences in neuroendocrine abnormalities of depressives are probably due to variations in the manifold factors influencing the hormonal axes involved, to temporal changes in hormonal patterns (e.g. one abnormality triggering another) and to individual differences in the basic activity and the responsiveness of the various axes.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

The prevalence of depression does not decrease in the elderly, affective disorders in old people, however, often manifest masked by physical illness worsening the course of these somatic disorders. Elderly depression also tends to present with a peculiar clinical picture. Atypical and also only few symptoms are characteristic of depression in the elderly. Vegetative symptoms are often primary and depression in old people often manifests solely in somatic symptoms. Typical cognitive alterations and pseudodementia are also characteristic features. At the same time, typical affective symptoms of depression are often absent, and instead of psychomotor retardation, psychomotor agitation manifested as irritability or motor restlessness is frequent. In the diagnostic process depression in the elderly should be separated from somatic diseases and dementia. The correct diagnosis and treatment of depression in the elderly is very important, since old age depression does not only cause significant distress, but often leads to suicide, and in addition, it generally increases morbidity and mortality, worsens the general somatic condition of the patient and increases social isolation.",

Therefore, it is necessary to identify strategies that allow an adequate assessment that would let us obtain a more precise and useful diagnosis. Nevertheless, an important obstacle for this task, is a lack of theoretical clarity in regard to diagnostic criteria or, especially, to symptoms which are relevant for depression. This fact is obvious in the scales focused on depression assessment, which have a broad variety of symptoms to assess, and it is possible to overestimate some areas or to underestimate others, related to theoretical criterions which were involved in test construction.

      "title": "Using ’White Flags’ to categorize socio-cultural aspects in chronic pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Issue Persistent chronic pain is a major medical and health economic problem. To assess the individual pain situation, the classification of various factors (flags) has been established. Description of the problem Structural biomechanical factors are classified as “red flags”. Psychological or behavioral factors are summarized as “yellow flags”, psychiatric and mental illness as “orange flags”. Both last flags are important for planning adequate therapies or rehabilitation, as well as for decisions to prognoses and tailored reintegration programs. An extension of the flag model was achieved by naming personal factors at workplace as “blue flags”, and “black flags”, if there is a restriction for returning to work. All these groups do not consider other important reasons for unsuccessful rehabilitation or failed reintegration. Results In these cases, often described as ’therapy-refractory’, clients often exhibit a special subjective understanding of illness that reacts neither to psychological interventions nor to behavioral therapies. These include individual beliefs based, for example, on cultural socialization, religious education, or spiritual experiences. Since such individual mental illnesses are culturally ideologically or religiously justified, they should be classified in a separate group called ’white flags’. Lessons The advantages of categorizing sociocultural aspects separately from other flag classifications are avoidance of unnecessary therapies, including surgery,prevention of iatrogenisation,prevention of legal disputes. It is important to realize that only health restrictions for insurance benefits can be taken into account and that individual socio-cultural circumstances or health convictions are not evaluated. Main messages: A classification of ’white flags’ could contribute to a better classification of pain which are not accessible to various therapies and reduce reservations and misunderstandings by intercultural communication approaches. Key messages For medical professions it is important to recognize, that only health inabilities are taken into account for insurance compensation and not individual socio-cultural circumstances or health beliefs. In Future classifying ’white flags’ could help to properly assess persistent pain conditions.",

Such patients are discharged from hospital without any apparent problems, but it is often the case that their families, and sometimes even they themselves, start to notice the emergence of new problems. They may exhibit affective changes, such as thinking that they are worthless, alone and without any future perspectives. When they are left without the help of specialists and/or family and friends, their problems gain even greater significance. PCS includes subjective physical complaints (i.e. headache, dizziness) and cognitive, emotional and behavioral changes. PCS influences all areas of the patient's life. Subjects who have sustained head injury often have problems with marital relationships, maintaining of independence, employment, leisure activities and other functions which are related to social adjustment. Various studies have attempted to predict the post-injury status of HI patients from information available, such as data on the severity of head injury, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and the results of neuropsychological assessment. This kind of prediction is important in planning of rehabilitation services and thus improving the kind of help available to survivors of HI. Early prediction of post-injury psychological status may also help the patient and his family in coping with the difficulties related to the trauma. We know a great deal about head injury and its consequences, but many questions still need to be answered. Among these are issues such as: the role of neurobehavioral data in the prediction of outcome for HI patients, the identification of variables determining the extent of PCS and the search for reliable factors which may influence future employment or school status. The assessment of patients for invalidity and other social security benefits also requires a more rational approach, based on the data available.",

It happens mostly through diminished cardiac vagal modulation and greater procoagulant activity in depressed patients. But the impact of emotional factors in acute cardiac events is not estimated enough. From the clinician's point of view, there are an increasing awareness concerning external circumstances and external triggering in sudden cardiac death, that is caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. A number of external, i.e. exogenous factors in everyday life can be implicated in triggering such events. Including heavy physical activity, emotional stressors, meteorologic variables, air pollutants, chronobiologic phenomena, food ingestions, coffee, alcohol etc., emotional stress seems to be among the most often triggers of sudden event. There is a wide range of everyday situations and activities that involves activation of sympathetic nervous system, and emotional stressors are described as trigger caused by sympathetic arousal. Acute emotional arousal can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias and the mechanisms of that risk have been recognized. Acute episode of emotional distress (and notably anger-like stress) may trigger ventricular ectopic beats and tachycardia, as well as acute myocardial infarction. These sudden phenomena can be the result of the endogenous response to external risk of acute emotional stress. Sudden death without antecedent angina, suggesting cardiac arrhythmia, as well as deaths preceded by chest pain, suggesting coronary occlusion were observed in many studies that have led to estimates that between 20 and 40 percent of sudden cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors.",

Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. The types of Stress are Acute Stress and Chronic Stress. Acute Stress is the body’s quick reaction to a new and challenging situation whereas chronic stress is Long-term stress experienced for an extended period which can create a negative impact on a person’s health. Things that cause stress are “stressors,” and stress is the personal reaction to that stressors. A number of scientists classified stressors as Biological Stressors, Psychological Stressors, Acute Stressors, Chronic Stressors, Environmental Stressors, Internal Stressors and Psychosocial Stressors. Stress is influenced by internal and external factors of a person. Stress causes different types of impacts on the physical body. Stress has negative consequences on various aspects of quality of life. Chronic stress can lead to or exacerbate mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, bipolar disorder, cognitive (thinking) problems, personality changes, and problem behaviours. Stress management techniques help to reduce stress. Understanding the sources of stress provides opportunities for planning interventions that would reduce the stressors.",

      "abstract": "The term sella (ESS) indicates the presence of an enlarged Sella turcica which contains a remodeled pituitary gland by pressing it against the back and lower wall of the sellar space. The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

      "abstract": "Major depression, as defined in <italic>DSM-5</italic>, is not necessarily “major.” Its history can be traced back to a unitary theory of dépression in which all symptoms are seen as falling on a continuum. The danger is that sadness, if it lasts for any length of time, will be diagnosed as depression. This approach has supported treatment practices that are not evidence-based. Not all patients meeting diagnostic criteria can be successfully treated with antidepressant medication. Psychiatry cannot become a clinical science unless it can separate what is pathological from what is normal.",

      "abstract": "Desafortunadamente, los trastornos de personalidad han sido excluidos habitualmente de los ensayos farmacológicos por problemas conceptuales o de medida. Esta falta de estudios, más que la existencia de evidencia negativa, ha llevado a que tradicionalmente se haya considerado que los sujetos con un trastorno de personalidad no se pudieran beneficiar de un adecuado tratamiento farmacológico. Los pacientes que sufren trastorno de personalidad (TP) muestran un funcionamiento social e interpersonal significativamente peor, consumiendo recursos socio-sanitarios con unos pobres resultados. En los TP, la farmacoterapia se utiliza para tratar aspectos específicos, como son los síntomas cognitivos perceptuales, afectivos o los derivados de la impulsividad. Debido a que es un fenómeno polimórfico, se utilizan diferentes tipos de psicofármacos, como por ejemplo, antipsicóticos, antidepresivos o estabilizadores del ánimo. Ha habido pocos intentos sistemáticos de validar los actuales algoritmos de tratamiento de los trastornos de personalidad severos. Esto ha hace que en el momento actual no haya guías en la literatura para el uso de farmacoterapia en el manejo de los TP. El objetivo de este trabajo es llevar a cabo una revisión de los estudios sobre eficacia y tolerabilidad de los psicofármacos en los TP.",

      "abstract": "Autonomic and somatic manifestations of anxiety are common in medically ill patients. When anxiety symptoms occur in such patients, the psychiatrist's ability to rapidly identify anxiety and perform a proper differential diagnosis is important, and can be life-saving. For example, a patient with deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary function may be misidentified as primarily \"anxious\" and referred to the psychiatrist. The change in the patient's medical status is missed until the situation becomes critical. Medication side effects can also cause anxiety symptoms in the medically ill patient. It is important for the psychiatrist to have knowledge of medications commonly associated with such side effects. Diagnosing primary anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, can be difficult in medically ill patients, but it is an important skill for the consulting psychiatrist. Anxiety can occur secondary to the stress or fear associated with illness, particularly serious illness. This presentation will discuss all of the aforementioned aspects of anxiety in the patient with concomitant medical illness.",

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms. We summarized relevant findings and provided a review of clinical considerations that physicians can use to aid in the evaluation of psychotic symptoms in the context of those three concepts.",

When the components of emotionalism are studied separately a wide range is observed and they combine in a more complex and varied way than commonly held stereotyped views suggest. Most patients with emotionalism are helped by simple education and reassurance. Some severe cases respond dramatically to tricyclic antidepressants, levodopa or fluoxetine.",

Type of prosthesis, but not amputation type, was related to depression for amputees. Patterns of depression on discriminant analysis did differentiate the groups. A depression symptom conglomerate suggesting guilt and body image change with fatigue characterized the Parkinson patients most and the amputees least. A second depression conglomerate suggesting indecisiveness and thoughts of death or self-harm characterized amputees most and stroke patients least.

Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes.

It is a perceptual state: the glass is always half-empty rather than half full. One sees only the dark side of things. It is tied to daily activities; it sabotages motivation and saps energy. It affects the most basic elements of life, causing insomnia, loss of appetite, and sexual dysfunction. Sometimes it’s linked to obsessive worry and rumination, always anticipating and expecting the worst to happen. We all encounter things in life that eat at our souls. Who would not be depressed when a loved one dies or illness strikes the family? If you have Parkinson’s disease (PD), the prospect of a chronic disease is discouraging in and of itself. If you have had to restrict your lifestyle because of PD, that is all the more reason to become discouraged. Hence depression is a part of the normal human existence and is appropriate during times when things are going very badly. Depression becomes pathological when it is prolonged, severe, or out of proportion to events. Although depression may be triggered by major life trauma, it sometimes comes out of nowhere.",

Delirium is a transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment and other behavioral and psychological phenomena, with a relatively rapid onset and a characteristically fluctuating course. Though it is a common disease, it is frequently missed or misdiagnosed, which leads to a substantial attendant morbidity and mortality potential. Often delirium is due to multiple simultaneous causes, each one of which may or may not be enough to cause delirium by itself. We report a case of delirium accompanied by ataxia, depression and psychotic symptoms in a 72 year-old man with atrial fibrillation and intermittent trifascicular block. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigation allows underlying causes to be detected and treated. Clinical experience requires, therefore, to think of the crisis with a view to the difficult effort of composition and synthesis of a plurality of factors of various kinds (biological, psychological, and interpersonal). Those factors intervene in acute psychosis at different times and with different specific weights.",

Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management. This concept paper therefore addresses abnormalities of mood and behaviour that are episodic in character and are not recognisably included in the DSM and ICD classifications of psychological or psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from a force to the head and can cause acute physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

A relationship between pain and mood has been supported by numerous clinical studies indicating significant comorbidity of chronic pain and various types of depressive illnesses. Besides the assumption that pain is simply a form of stress, the physiological basis for the coexistence of pain and depression is still being investigated. Studies described in this review address some of the cellular and molecular events occurring within the hippocampus that may be common to both pain and stress, possibly reflecting underlying mechanisms of chronic pain-related depression.",

The physical and psychological components of pain stress are then examined, and pain stress is held to comprise the complete process from onset of tissue damage or other noxious condition to the experience of pain itself. The pain‐gate theory as an explanation for the psychological anomalies of pain is briefly described. A distinction is then made between conditions of acute and chronic pain: the former presents with a pattern of anxiety, while the latter matches a psychiatric depressive condition. Chronic pain and depression are inextricably interwoven and interactive, and exist as a discrete and identifiable syndrome. Psychological pain management techniques have a minimal part to play in the treatment of acute pain, but become of increasing relevance and importance as the duration of the pain increases. Various types of psychological intervention for pain relief are listed, and it is suggested that the psychologist's most useful role is that of detailed comprehensive appraisal of the pain patient and the planning of a programme of psychological treatment specific to the individual concerned. Such therapy to reduce pain stress and eliminate pain strain can then be carried out by appropriate trained health care workers under medical supervision.",

El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro.

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant. (4) These phenomena might be caused by brain changes Jeffrey J. Rakofsky, MD References (1.) Solomon DA, Keller MB, Leon AC, et al. Multiple recurrences of major depressive disorder. …",

      "abstract": "A number of potential obstacles to objective diagnosis have been described, somatic presentations of 'masked depression' being only one of these. The morbidity associated with untreated depressive illness, availability of effective treatment resources, and gradually increasing community expectations, have all contributed to an increased responsibility on the medical practitioner for accurate diagnosis. It is evident that not only intellectual diagnostic acumen but an attitude of tolerance and acceptance of pathological emotional states is fundamental in facilitating self-disclosure leading to accurate diagnosis, and is a foundation for effective treatment. A model of depressive illness which includes biological, psychological and social aspects is appropriate, and can greatly augment mastery of these problems in practice.",

      "title": "People presenting with physical disorder",
      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a frequent ineffectiveness in brain functioning. It is a disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over a short period of time and it is a neurocognitive disorder. Delirium provides an idiosyncratic chance for a better understanding of the neurocognitive reserve. Acute illness considered as a basis of delirium and it is usually activated by head trauma and recent surgeries. Delirium like dementia is clearly remarkable by a general disability in which a condition of being unable to perform as a consequence of physical and mental unfitness. It has also been observed that delirium can increase the rate of development of dementia. Unfortunately, the development of delirium or acute brain dysfunction is considered a non-essential component of a critical or unfavorable disease. The agitation and inactivity that is occurred in a delirium can increase the risk or danger of complications. Delirium is a major cause and the problem of hospitalization and should be considered a medical crisis. For these reasons its identification, prescription, and effective treatment are essential. For delirium treatment, the most common antipsychotic drugs are used. Emerging pharmacological strategies which include various antipsychotics drugs for addressing delirium should be combined with non-pharmacological approaches which are designed as a first line interventions.",

It adversely effect a wide range of health condition and yoga is the most comprehensive approach to fighting stress. When we are in stress our nervous system respond by releasing a flood of stress hormone. This hormone stimulates the body for emergency action by “fight-flight or freeze” reaction also known as stress response. The agent which causes stress is known as ‘stressors’. Stress causes many harmful effect on the body such as , Physical impact - Weight gain/loss, Unexpected hair loss, Heart palpitations, High blood pressure, Digestive symptoms (such as dryness of mouth, flatulence, nausea, butterfly stomach)etc. Emotional negative effect includes Mood swing, Anxiety, Can lead to depression & unhealthy coping strategies (i.e. alcohol, drugs).",

Стрілецький спорт можна вважати радше статичним, а не динамічним видом спорту, де динаміка присутня, але, на відмінну від таких видів спорту, як біатлон, вона у рази менша. Проблему неспецифічного болю у спині спортсменів-стрільців вивчено недостатньо, є велика кількість причин через виникнення болю – від генетично успадкованих захворювань до того, що спортсмен змінив поставу заради досягнення більш кращого результату. Це дослідження було спрямоване на вивчення впливу неспецифічного болю не тільки на результати на змаганнях, а і на життя спортсмена в цілому. Неспецифічний біль у спині є багатофакторною проблемою, яку потрібно розглядати в широкому аспекті, бо, окрім успадкованих захворювань, порушення постави може виникати і через тривалий стрес, через низькі результати на змаганнях або завеликий об’єм тренувальної діяльності. Будь-який з цих аспектів може впливати на виникнення неспецифічного болю у спині. Було проведене опитування спортсменів, щоб дізнатись, наскільки сильно впливає неспецифічний біль у спині на тренувальну діяльність та життя спортсмена. Мета та завдання – проаналізувати стан спортсменів-стрільців з проявами неспецифічного болю у спині за допомогою сучасних наукових досліджень. Методи дослідження. Проведено опитування спортсменів-стрільців різних спортивних звань з неспецифічним болем у спині. Результати дослідження. Провівши опитування двадцяти шести спортсменів з приводу неспецифічного болю у спині, ми визначили, що це одна із основних проблем, яка заважає отримувати високі результати на змаганнях. Висновки. Аналіз даних показує, що досить багато спортсменів-стрільців має проблеми з неспецифічним болем у спині. Така проблема потребує вирішення. Необхідне подальше надання допомоги спортсменам задля того, щоб спортсмени могли у майбутньому показували більш якісні результати і мали більше можливостей для продовження тренування та вдосконалення їх навичок. Також потрібні подальші досліди для визначення ефективного способу відновлення спортсменів з цією проблемою.",

      "abstract": "In the last recent decades, stress has become an inevitable part plaguing the daily lives. Psychological stress has a negative impact over physical, mental and social well-being of a person. It has been suggested to play an important role in causation or precipitation of multitude of medical and dental problems ranging from serious heart diseases, cancers, gastrointestinal diseases, to common headaches, migraine, recurrent oral ulcerations, burning and dry mouth. In order to better understand the role of stress, valid and reliable measurement of stress is of utmost importance. Since, most of methods used for the diagnosis of stress are questionnaires form (subjective methods) which depend on person and there is many inter individual variation between subjects, thus there is increased need of biological stress markers to provide an objective, reliable and authentic evidence of stress. Self-reporting subjective questionnaire forms in stress evaluation and as psychological diagnostic mean provide highly inconsistent results according to patient’s mood and attitude. And this is because many individuals suffering from stress related problems have a tendency to either negate or exaggerate the real condition; which may lead to a deviation in the study and discompose the results. Thus there is a high need for studying the changes caused by stress in the human body to evaluate the usefulness of the bio physiological indicators or biomarkers to provide a reliable objective evaluation and assessment of a stress and psychologically related conditions. Salivary biomarkers are one of most widely researched area of interest because it might to provide a reliable, noninvasive and objective measurements of the response of the body, also because of easy and rapid collection of samples compared to the blood and urine samples thereby increasing the patient compliance. Many biomarkers have been used in determination of stress such as cortisol levels, immunoglobulins, cardiovascular parameters.

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

It may have a beneficial, protective function to prevent exhaustion and overexertion. Sometimes fatigue can even be experienced as a pleasant feeling if it is of reasonable duration. On the other hand, fatigue as a pathological condition is always experienced as an ,unpleasant sensation. Asthenia is perceived as an unpleasant sensation whenever it exceeds one’s physiological resources, such as rest that must be recuperated. In a number of nontumor-associated conditions, asthenia, experienced as fatigue and/or weakness, is definitely a component or even a leading symptom (Table 9.1).",

But unless their mechanism of disability is understood the patients may be markedly incapacitated and wander from physician to physician vainly seeking help.

Depression is a multifaceted condition characterised by episodes of mood disturbances alongside other symptoms such as anhedonia, psychomotor complaints, feelings of guilt and suicidal tendencies, all of which can range in severity. Anxiety and fear can be defined as response of subject to real or potential threats that may impair his/her homeostasis that can significantly mark function and quality of life. Some of depressive disorder overlap those of anxiety disorders, including severe phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety-related disorders such as patient’s nervousness, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress are foremost causes of infirmity in the world.

Les causes de ces absences sont variables, multiples et associees : les difficultes emotionnelles, comme l'anxiete ou la depression, les troubles du comportement, les difficultes familiales et sociales, les troubles des apprentissages, le manque de motivation ; elles sont associees eventuellement a des interets predominants presents a l'exterieur de l'ecole. Le refus scolaire anxieux est l'entite la plus etudiee et documentee aussi bien sur le plan descriptif que therapeutique. Il s'agit de jeunes absents de l'ecole pour des raisons principalement anxieuses. Les troubles internalises sous-jacents sont tres souvent retrouves (anxiete et-ou depression) et sont parfois associes a des troubles externalises. La prise en charge est pluridisciplinaire scolaire et psychiatrique : traitement psychotherapique, rescolarisation progressive et guidance parentale. Pour les autres causes d'absenteisme, l'analyse fonctionnelle de chaque situation permet d'elaborer un plan de soins adapte a chaque jeune. Une coordination des differentes interventions est necessaire : scolaire, psychologique, sociale, judiciaire. Le pronostic de l'absenteisme est academique, social et psychiatrique et parait severe en l'absence de traitement adapte : l'absenteisme scolaire et les troubles emotionnels se maintiennent, avec des risques de decrochage scolaire, de troubles de la socialisation et d'aggravation d'autres pathologies psychiatriques. L'equilibre familial est egalement bouleverse. Le reperage de ces adolescents absents de l'ecole peut permettre de leur proposer une intervention adaptee. Dans les cas de refus scolaires anxieux, la prise en charge de l'anxiete permet un retour progressif en scolarite dans la plupart des cas. Pour les autres causes d'absenteisme, les interventions multidisciplinaires permettent d'elaborer un projet de formation, une reprise de la vie sociale, et ainsi de s'inscrire dans un projet de vie plus realiste et constructif.[resume d'auteur]",

The doctor requires knowledge, skill, and most of all experience, but can improve the chances of a correct diagnosis and appropriate management by careful history taking, examination, and observation. This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium. The same patient can have both or neither subtype.\n\nDelirium tremens is a specific term for the confusional state caused by withdrawal of alcohol.\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of delirium depend on the population studied. Prevalence in hospital ranges from 10–20% in medical wards and could become higher as the elderly population in hospital increases. The incidence during hospitalisation ranges from 4–30%, again depending on the population studied.

Una de las principales caracteristicas de los pacientes con TLP es la existencia de una marcada inestabilidad afectiva, caracterizada por la tendencia a estados emocionales negativos tales como la ira, la ansiedad y la disforia (Lieb et al., 2004). Otros sintomas nucleares de este trastorno son los comportamientos impulsivos, las autolesiones, el abuso de sustancias y la promiscuidad sexual especialmente en el contexto de estados emocionales negativos, sintomas que tambien estarian vinculados a la existencia de una disregulacion emocional de base (Clarkin et al., 2005). Los mecanismos neurales subyacentes a esta disregulacion emocional, caracteristica de los pacientes con TLP pueden ser estudiados utilizando diferentes tipos de tecnicas funcionales, tanto a traves de pruebas de neuroimagen como mediante abordajes electrofisiologicos. Los modelos dimensionales de la emocion conciben la estructura de las emociones a partir de dos dimensiones estrategicas principales, la valencia afectiva y el arousal (Lang, 1994; Bradley, et al., 2001). La valencia o polaridad emocional, es el grado de placer o desagrado, con un rango que va desde la atraccion y el placer hasta la aversion y el displacer. El arousal o intensidad emocional es el grado de activacion cuyo rango va desde la excitacion a la calma. La dimension valencia emocional se ha asociado con la activacion de los sistemas motivacionales apetitivo o de defensa, mientras que la dimension arousal ha sido considerada como el grado de activacion de cada sistema motivacional primario o de ambos (Lang, 1995; Cacioppo y Berntson, 1994)...",

Pourtant, les réponses proposées dans le monde de l’entreprise restent limitées à la gestion du stress, semblant ignorer l’existence de réels troubles de l’humeur d’origine professionnelle. Il est vrai que la plupart des intervenants au sein des entreprises n’ont pas de formation psychiatrique. Il existe d’authentiques dépressions professionnelles qui surviennent suite à des difficultés dans le monde du travail et s’expriment principalement au travail. Ces dépressions représentent la majeure partie des dépenses médicales occasionnées par les problèmes de santé mentale. La dépression des dirigeants d’entreprise, souvent méconnue, est un facteur causal de certaines faillites. La sémiologie est spécifique, les éléments de prise en charge et de prévention primaire, sont très différents de ceux du stress professionnel. De la même façon, le cadre législatif est surprenant. La dépression n’existe pas dans le tableau des maladies professionnelles, et sa reconnaissance hors tableau est difficile, avec en particulier, une absence de présomption d’origine. Au contraire, le suicide est désormais fréquemment reconnu comme accident du travail. Notre intervention, après avoir rappelé la sémiologie spécifique des troubles de l’humeur d’origine professionnelle, fera le point sur les aspects de prévention spécifique et sur les éléments de prise en charge.

There is evidence that depression and other negative emotional states are risk factors for the development of a variety of health outcomes, while serious illness also elicits psychological distress. Comorbid depression and distress are associated with poor outcomes in several chronic illnesses including coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, some cancers, chronic pain and arthritis. The mechanisms linking depression and distress with illness include habitual lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity and smoking, poor treatment adherence, and biological processes including systemic inflammation, adrenocortical and autonomic dysregulation. Screening for depression and distress has been advocated. Treatments of psychological conditions may improve quality of life and emotional state in people with serious illnesses. The evidence for effects of interventions targeting depression and distress on the course of chronic illness is equivocal.",

      "title": "The Bipolar Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Byline: M. Reddy it to Broaden it to Shrink it to Broaden it.... ! is the beginning and a part of Mania…. The development of Mania is really a worsening of the disease (Melancholia) rather than change into another disease. (Aretaeus of Cappadocia, 100 AD). Mania is Primary, with Depression being the consequence of preceding Mania, which means the Recurrent Unipolar subgroup of MDI does not really exist since all depressive presentations are preceded by a manic presentation. (Koukopoulos, 2006). That Happiness and Sadness, the two normal and very common emotions of every human being, constitute the core clinical features of a disease, Depressive Illness (MDI), remains a fascinating, though disturbing, fact. The magnification of joy and worry, two poles of the normal emotional spectrum, reaches such gigantic proportion necessitating treatment. The clinical presentation varying between the two poles, often alternating, naturally reveals itself as a spectrum disorder of conditions and related temperaments. For Eugene Bleuler a patient was predominantly schizophrenic or predominantly manic-depressive in the spectrum of psychosis. But Emil Kraeplin, father of classification in modern psychiatry, segregated the two major psychotic illnesses into Manic-depressive insanity and Dementia praecox. By 1913, Kraeplin brought virtually all of the major clinical forms, which had *Episodic or Periodic course *Benign prognosis *Family history of MDI, under the diagnosis of -Depressive illness (MDI) in which he included Bipolar Disorders (BD) and Recurrent Depressive Disorders. The Bipolar Spectrum concept can be approached from two different ways: *Manic - Depressive Spectrum: Continuum between Bipolar and Unipolar *Bipolar Spectrum: Restricted to BD with continuum between Full blown illness (BD I) to Milder illness to Temperament traits (Cyclothymia ……). Understanding the concept of Bipolar/Manic Depressive Spectrum demands a brief journey into the history dating back to the last quarter of 19th century. SHRINK IT - 1875-1925 [Figure 1]{Figure 1} The Northwest Wales asylum, opened in 1848, catered to a specific geographic location of the population and had admission of 3172 patients from 1875 to 1924. As depicted in the graph, mania as percentage of all admissions was 60% in 1885 which got Shrunk to around 20% in 1920. In 1885, the diagnosis of mania referred to any state of OVERACTIVE INSANITY. Around 1900, primarily in response to Kraeplin's impact, the use of mania as a diagnosis in North Wales began to fall (limited only to episodic illness with benign course) progressively to about 4% in 1924.[1] BROADEN IT: 2nd quarter of 20th century Manic Depressive insanity….. includes on one hand the whole domain of periodic and circular insanity, on the other hand simple mania, the greater parts of the morbid states termed Melancholia (Emil Kreaplin, 1924). [INLINE:1] The unifying Broadeningconcept of MDI, which brought together all the mood disorders, separating from Dementia Praecox, was based on *Episodic, recurrent course of illness *Benign course and outcome. SHRINK IT (again): 2nd half of 20th Century Move forward to the 3rd quarter and the first half of the 4th quarter of 20th century. The Kreaplinian concept of MDI was considered too inclusive and in 1957 Karl Leonhard proposed the concept, propagated later by the works of Angst, 2002,[2] and Perris, of dividing the MDI into two sub groups: Bipolar and Unipolar, the only difference being presence/absence of mania. The Broad MDI concept was shrunk again by separating BD group away from the unipolar group. The term bipolar was introduced in DSM III in 1980 and in ICD 10 in 1992; since then the unipolar and BD are categorized as two separate diagnostic entities in the classificatory system. …",

A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11.

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

      "title": "A SPIRITUAL CURE FOR SCRUPULOSITY1",
      "abstract": "One of the cases of spiritual direction, which most frequently arises in the increasingly strenuous life of our age, is that of scrupulosity. The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

      "abstract": "Sport retirement is a multifaceted process consisting of a variety of emotional and psychological responses. Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

The phenomena can vary from transient symptoms under stress, to a lifelong coping style, to a disabling disorder. The phenomena are manifest in illness behaviour, a concept that has attracted wide- spread controversy as to whether it is a clinical entity or an ‘idiom of distress’. The phenomena have many potential meanings for the patient–environment relationship and these are explored in this chapter.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders. Anxiety disorders and neurotic fear cause significant disruption of the psychosocial functioning of the individual. In generalized anxiety disorder, neurotic fear appears in the form of fears, expectations, tension, with nothing specifically uncomprehendingly crying anticipation, worry, poor concentration, psychic and physical fatigue, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, sense of near accident etc. Traumatic events in the life of the individual are often referred to as potential relevant factors in the occurrence of psychological disorders. Exposure to long-lasting traumatic experiences in childhood leads to the prolongation and fixation of the emotional state of fear and sadness and the emphasized use of certain defense mechanisms that contribute to the structuring of specific clinical images of anxiety states.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In contrast to many clinical pain syndromes, wherein a medical history and physical examination usually lead to the diagnosis of a structural lesion or biochemical alteration, the functional pain syndromes are without fixed organic peripheral changes. The functional pain disorders include fibromyalgia (FM), atypical facial pain (also termed idiopathic facial pain), non-specific low-back pain (NSLBP), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and are characterized by their persistence, intractability, and apparent absence of peripheral disease. Various psychiatric designations have been applied to pain disorders that are characterized by medically unexplained symptoms: somatization, somatoform disorders, psychogenic disease, chronic multisymptom illness, affective spectrum disorders, and central sensitization syndromes as well as functional disorders (Barsky &amp; Borus, 1999; Clauw &amp; Chrousos, 1997; Clauw et al.,1997; Hudson et al.,1992; Hudson &amp; Pope, 1989; Wessely et al.,1999). A functional disorder is one that, after appropriate medical assessment, cannot be explained in terms of a conventionally defined medical disease based on biochemical or structural abnormalities (Derbyshire et al.,2004; Wessely et al.,1999; Drossman et al.,2000).Although these disorders are routinely assessed and viewed as separate clinical entities, combining these systemic and regional conditions in a review is justified by several observations: (1) there is considerable overlap in the case definitions of specific syndromes, (2) the disorders co-aggregate in individuals, (3) patients with different syndromes share non-symptom characteristics, (4) the functional syndromes all respond to similar therapies, (5) the syndromes share common neurobiological mechanisms, such as abnormal sensory processing, neuroendocrine, and autonomic dysfunction (Wessely et al.,1999),",

Cancer-related fatigue has many causes. Included in the causes are the illness itself, the side effects of virtually every treatment, depression, and other biopsychosocial factors. As a result, fatigue is the most common symptom reported by cancer patients in most descriptive studies. In addition to arising from multiple etiologies, fatigue is also multidimensional in its manifestation and impact. Its effect on the quality of life of the patient is comparable to that of pain. Experienced by most patients as an extremely frustrating state of chronic energy depletion, it leads to loss of productivity which can reduce self-esteem. As a subtle and chronic symptom, it also places people at risk for being questioned about the veracity of their complaints, particularly during the post-treatment, disease-free survival period. Patients themselves are reluctant to complain of fatigue, perhaps because they believe little can be done about it, or they wish to avoid drawing attention away from treating their cancer.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

Neuropathic pain, or pain associated with disease or injury to the peripheral or central nervous system, is a common symptom of a heterogeneous group of conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Chronic neuropathic pain should not be thought of as a symptom. It should truly be thought of as a disease with a very complicated pathophysiology. Pathophysiology. The mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central pathophysiologic phenomenon. The underlying dysfunction may involve deafferentation within the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuropathy), deafferentation within the central nervous system (e.g. post-thalamic stroke) or an imbalance between the two (e.g. phantom limb pain). Clinical characteristics. Neuropathic pain is non-nociceptive, in contrast to acute nociceptive pain, and it can be described as ?burning?, ?electric?, ?tingling?, and ?shooting? in nature. Treatment. Rational polypharmacy is often necessary and actually it is almost always the rule. It would be an exception if a patient was completely satisfied with his treatment. Treatment goals should include understanding that our patients may need to be titrated and managed with more than one agent and one type of treatment. There should be the balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Conclusion. There are many new agents and new applications of the existing agents being currently studied which will most certainly lead to even more improved ways of managing this very complicated set of disorders.",

Migraine and post-traumatic headache share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, and both can considerably decrease quality of life.

Although there are no approved pharmacologic treatments specific to post-traumatic headache, emerging strategies focus on treatment paradigms similar to migraine management. Failure to address post-traumatic headache and post-traumatic migraine will lead to prolonged post-concussive symptoms and the misunderstanding that such prolonged symptoms are a result of incomplete recovery from concussion.",

However, pain is not always related to tissue damage and does not always serve a protective function. This is the case with neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory parts of the nervous system, and with some other chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and migraine.2 Acute and chronic pain may cause suffering and interfere with daily life, factors that influence the choice of treatment. Acute pain is the most common reason for visiting an emergency department,3 and surgical procedures are often associated with acute postoperative pain.4,5 Chronic pain also causes suffering, as reflected by the finding in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 that chronic low back pain was the leading cause of years lived with disability.6 In addition to the contribution of pain to disability, that study showed that the associated problem of opioid use disorders accounted for 5.8 million additional years lived with disability,6 an observation that underpins attempts to treat pain with drugs other than opioids. Long-term opioid administration has minimal effects on chronic pain and can cause tolerance, drowsiness, and dependence, as well as impaired memory, concentration, and judgment.7 For these reasons, the International Association for the Study of Pain recommends caution in prescribing opioids for chronic pain,8 and there has been an increased emphasis on the use of nonopioid pain management. The choice of treatment for pain depends on many factors, and the heterogeneity and large number of acute and chronic pain conditions preclude a general treatment algorithm. In cooperation with the World Health Organization, the International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a classification of chronic pain for the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases2 (Table 1), and a similar classification has been proposed for acute pain,5 providing the bases for facilitating treatment pathways.",

      "abstract": "It is not unusual for patients who say they are sick to have normal results on standard laboratory testing. The physician often concludes that there is no “real” illness and that the patients’ symptoms likely stem from a psychological disorder. An alternative conclusion, often honored in the breach, is that the standard laboratory tests are measuring the wrong things.\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)―also called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome―is such an illness. Often, the condition begins suddenly, following an “infectious-like” illness. For years, patients do not return to full health. The illness waxes and wanes, and at its worst leads patients to be bedridden or unable to leave their homes. A report from the National Academies estimates that CFS affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and generates direct and indirect expenses of $17–24 billion annually (1). The most widely used case definition (2) consists only of symptoms. This, along with typically normal results on standard laboratory tests, has raised the question of whether there are any “real” objective, biological abnormalities in CFS. In PNAS, Montoya et al. (3) report the latest evidence that there are such abnormalities.\n\nIndeed, research over the past 30 y has discovered pathology involving the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS), energy metabolism (with associated oxidative and nitrosative stress), and the immune system, as described in a detailed review (4). This Commentary will briefly summarize the evidence, providing citations only to work published since this review. I will then place the report by Montoya et al. (3) in context, and speculate about the pathophysiology of the illness.\n\nFormal testing reveals that CFS patients are more sensitive to painful stimuli, and have cognitive deficits in attention, memory, and reaction time.

These abnormalities may even precede the seizures themselves and though this might be a reflection of the dysfunction of a specific brain region or, in some cases, a diffuse brain disorder that is global, which manifests itself later as epilepsy.

      "abstract": "\"Psychosomatic medicine\" does not demand that the general practitioner function as a psychiatrist; rather, it is a psychiatric orientation that can increase the effectiveness of purely medical treatment for such conditions as neuroses. The general practitioner to whom the patient turns may achieve permanent results with nonverbal techniques where formal psychotherapy would be impracticable or unacceptable. The first aim is to relieve pressure so that the patient can regain his mental balance and thereby his self-confidence. Arts, hobbies, sports, and the like can be prescribed rather specifically according to the patient's personality and needs. Nutrition can be improved simply at first by prescribing needed additions to diet rather than imposing restrictions. Vitamin deficiency may by itself be the cause of neurosis or more serious mental disease, whereas psychic stress by itself may create a need for additional vitamin intake. Hormone therapy may be extremely helpful but must be based on clear indication and limited to specific purposes. Since lack of sleep and rest quickly impairs mental function, it is important for neurotic persons to learn relaxation as a necessity for sleep. Sedatives may be used in a crisis but should be abandoned as soon as possible. With all drugs there are problems of excess and habituation. The least, the mildest, the shortest dosage is the ideal. THE INITIAL STEPS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY PHYSICIAN: Establishing rapport, noting how complaints are stated, encouraging ventilation, winning confidence rather than immediate results.",

Burnout has been related to human service professions with chronic inter-personal stress as its caused (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). It is conceived as a state of mental, physical and emotional exhaustion, typically occurring as a result of long-term involvement with people in situations, which are emotionally demanding. Burnout can be defined as the end result of stress experienced, but not properly coped with resulting in symptoms of exhaustion, irritation, ineffectiveness, discounting of self, others and problems of health (Hypertension, Ulcers and Heart Problems).",

      "abstract": "ZUSAMMENFASSUNG In Literatur und Laienpresse kursieren Hunderte Definitionen zu Burnout. Obwohl sich die DGPPN bereits 2012 klar positioniert hat und eine enge Definition veröffentlicht hat, wird der Begriff teilweise immer noch inflationär gebraucht. Dabei gab es bereits mit dem Begriff der Neurasthenie vor über 100 Jahren den Versuch, arbeitsbezogene psychische Störungen nosologisch einzuordnen. Aktuell besteht in Deutschland weitgehender Konsens Burnout als Risikostadium zur Entwicklung einer seelischen Erkrankung aufzufassen. Ätiologisch ist vor dem Hintergrund eines biopsychosozialen multifaktoriellen Modells anzunehmen, dass eine mit dem Alter physiologisch abnehmende Belastbarkeit bei gleichbleibender oder teilweise sogar steigender seelischer Arbeitsbelastung über die Lebensspanne ein wesentlicher Faktor ist. Auf Symptomebene kommt es nach ausreichender Erholung und/oder Arbeitsabstinenz in der Regel relativ rasch zu einer deutlichen Besserung und teilweise sogar vollständigen Genesung. Um diesen Zustand zu erhalten und das Risiko einer nachfolgenden Erkrankung wie z. B. einer Depression oder einer Suchterkrankung zu reduzieren ist eine Modifikation der äußeren Bedingungen (z. B. Stärkung von Ressourcen, Reduktion der Arbeitslast) unumgänglich. Erfahrungsgemäß lässt sich dies nur über eine Änderung innerer aufrechterhaltender Faktoren wie individueller Stressverstärker oder fester Glaubengrundsätze erreichen. Einige zum Teil auch wissenschaftlich gut evaluierte Präventionsprogramme sind hierfür verfügbar.",

When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

Major vs. minor poststroke depression, specificity and sensitivity of depressive symptoms: The phenomenology of major poststroke depression has been found to be similar to that of primary depression, and it appears that minor and major are not stages of the same continuum, but rather separate entities. Contrary to common opinion, non specific somatic symptoms do not hinder the diagnosis of poststroke depression and can be highly discriminative and crucial in the evaluation of poststroke depression. Validity of the poststroke depression diagnosis Studies have shown that a valid diagnosis of poststroke depression may be established successfully using structured or semi-structured neuropsychiatric interviews, according to the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Criteria.

      "title": "Management of chronic non-cancer pain in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "La dépression postnatale, un phénomène dépressif atypique? : analyse des critères de sévérité de la symptomatologie et de la spécificité des symptômes et des causes",
      "abstract": "A l'heure actuelle, il est communement admis que la naissance d'un enfant constitue une experience de vie positive. Pourtant, cette ideologie maternelle ne semble pas faire l'unanimite pour toutes les meres. En effet, 13% d'entre elles presenteront une depression postnatale (DPP) suite a la naissance de leur enfant. L'accroissement d'interet pour ce probleme de sante mentale a permis de reconnaitre son ampleur et de l'introduire dans le « Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Health » (DSM-IV) en 1994, aux cotes des autres troubles de l'humeur. La DPP a ainsi ete assimilee a une depression majeure (DM), non dissociable des depressions survenant a d'autres periodes de la vie. Toutefois, un examen approfondi de la litterature scientifique nous demontre que la DPP reste encore un phenomene controverse. En effet, tous les auteurs ne semblent pas adherer a ce discours biomedical et soulignent davantage le caractere unique de la DPP. Le debat se situe entre autre, autour des criteres de severite et de specificite de cette condition. Pour certains chercheurs, la DPP serait une forme particuliere de depression qui possederait ses propres caracteristiques cliniques et qui serait declenchee par des facteurs specifiques a la naissance. L'objectif general de cette these vise donc a ameliorer notre comprehension du phenomene depressif en contexte postnatal et a verifier la legitimite de la comparer a une depression non postnatale (DNP). Preciser les criteres de severite de la symptomatologie et de la specificite des symptomes et des causes de la DPP s'avere primordial afin de permettre le developpement de strategies preventives et d'interventions adequates qui repondent le mieux aux besoins des meres qui souffrent de symptomes depressifs en postpartum. Cette recherche doctorale est composee de cinq chapitres. Le chapitre I presente une recension des principales recherches qui se sont interessees a l'etude de la severite de la symptomatologie et de la specificite des symptomes et des causes de la DPP. On y demontre que malgre les nombreuses etudes et annees de recherche, la controverse qui entoure la nature de la DPP comme phenomene distinct de la DNP demeure toujours tres presente, autant dans la litterature scientifique que dans la pratique clinique. Le chapitre II comprend un premier article qui porte sur l'etude de la severite des symptomes depressifs en periode postnatale. Il vise a comprendre si la symptomatologie depressive postnatale se presente sur un continuum de severite ou de facon dichotomique. Les resultats relatifs a l'anxiete, a la detresse psychologique, et a la qualite de vie par l'atteinte des objectifs (QVBO), appuient la nature continue du phenomene depressif en postpartum. Le continuum de severite suggere d'intervenir aupres des meres souffrant de tableaux depressifs mineurs ou dits sous-cliniques en contexte postnatal en leur apportant un soutien adequat qui repond a leurs besoins. La pertinence d'identifier ces tableaux depressifs sous-cliniques et les implications cliniques qui en decoulent est discutee. Le chapitre III devoile les resultats d'un second article qui examine la specificite des symptomes de la DPP. Grâce a une methodologie qualitative, elle tente d'analyser les differences et les similitudes des symptomes percus par les meres souffrant de DPP et de DNP. Les entretiens de 20 participantes souffrant de DPP et de 10 souffrant de DNP, ont ete soumis a une analyse de contenu. L'analyse indique que les deux groupes de meres semblent presenter un profil symptomatologique generalement similaire. Toutefois, les quelques particularites observees fournissent des indices importants pour l'optimisation de la prevention de la DPP. Les implications cliniques de ces resultats sont discutees. Le chapitre IV comprend un troisieme article qui explore les similitudes et les differences des causes percues, rapportees par les meres en DPP et en DNP pour expliquer l'apparition de leurs symptomes depressifs. Les entretiens des 30 participantes souffrant de DPP (n=20) et de DNP (n=10) ont ete soumis a une analyse de contenu. Les resultats n'appuient pas l'hypothese d'une etiologie specifique a la naissance dans le developpement de la DPP. La DPP et la DNP seraient declenchees par des facteurs vraisemblablement similaires. Les implications cliniques qui en decoulent sont egalement discutees. Finalement, le chapitre V presente une discussion generale et une analyse critique des resultats obtenus dans les trois articles exposes dans cette these. Y seront discutees les considerations methodologiques, les implications cliniques des resultats, les limites et les forces de cette recherche doctorale ainsi que les pistes de recherches futures. Les resultats de cette these concluent que la DPP semble s'apparenter a la DNP. Les quelques particularites observees dans l'experience des meres en DPP ne suffisent pas a justifier la creation d'un diagnostic distinct pour cette forme de depression. Le maintien du specificateur « avec debut lors du postpartum » est toutefois suggere afin d'accroitre la prevention de ce phenomene depressif et de fournir des traitements adequats qui repondent aux besoins des meres en periode postnatale.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : depression postnatale, severite, specificite, symptomes, causes, depression non postnatale.",

      "abstract": "ANY CONSIDERATION of the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy must begin with a definition or a clear understanding of the disease and the phase of the disease to be treated. Whether \"idiopathic\" or \"essential\" or \"cryptogenic\" epilepsy is a symptom, a symptom-complex or a disease entity is of little consequence. Those workers who would argue this point invariably introduce some special designation for the syndrome which is usually understood to be a disease entity.<sup>1</sup>My definition follows: Idiopathic epilepsy is a chronic, usually progressive, inherited disorder of the brain, characterized by periodically recurring convulsions (major seizures), lapses (minor seizures, petit mal or petit mal variant attacks) or behavior disturbances (psychomotor episodes) which occur in a person with no other demonstrable, relevant neurologic disease and with no recognized pathologic lesion except the cerebral dysrhythmia elicited by means of the electroencephalograph. The attacks are usually precipitated by some sort of metabolic disturbance,",

Pode ser primária, quando é a patologia em si, ou secundária, quando representa um sintoma de outra patologia estrutural. Objetivo: Apresentar uma síntese das informações mais relevantes sobre a cefaleia tensional. Material e Método: Foi realizada uma revisão em livros e bases de dados eletrônicos, tendo como critério de inclusão artigos tidos como de grande relevância, publicados em português, inglês ou espanhol. Resultados: Destaca-se entre as primárias, a cefaleia tipo tensional, caracterizada por sensações dolorosas de caráter compressivo, leves ou moderadas, nas regiões frontal, parietal, temporal e/ou occipital, bilateralmente. É subclassificada de acordo com sua duração em episódica pouco frequente, episódica frequente e crônica. Sua fisiopatologia é complexa e envolve mecanismos periféricos e centrais de gênese da dor, devendo ser diferenciada de outros tipos de cefaleia. Exibe diversos fatores desencadeantes, em especial os de ordem psicológica, que na maioria dos casos podem ser evitados como forma de prevenção. Sua terapêutica pode ser farmacológica ou não, agindo de forma abortiva e/ou profilática. Conclusão: A cefaleia tensional, embora muito prevalente, é subdiagnosticada, geralmente pela falta de conhecimento de médicos generalistas, fato que pode resultar em adoção de planos terapêuticos indevidos e, consequentemente, culminar em prejuízo na qualidade de vida dos doentes. Este distúrbio é passível de prevenção, com mudanças de hábitos a fim de se minimizar ou extinguir fatores desencadeantes.Descritores: Cefaleia; Cefaleia do Tipo Tensional; Manifestações Neurológicas.",

      "abstract": "Hauptmerkmal der körperdysmorphen Störung (KDS) ist eine übermäßige Beschäftigung mit einem wahrgenommenen Makel oder Defekt im körperlichen Aussehen (z. B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

The disorder was first described in 1886 as dysmorphophobia in the European medical literature, but not officially included as a distinct diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association until 1987. According to the DSM‐IV‐R, diagnostic criteria include(1) a preoccupation with an imagined or slight appearance defect; if slight defect is apparent, the person's concern is extreme; (2) the preoccupation results in significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning; and (3) the preoccupation is not due to another psychiatric disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa). A diagnosis of Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type can also be applied to persons who hold their distorted beliefs with delusional intensity. BDD is currently categorized as Somatoform Disorder, although it has been argued that it is more appropriately classified as an obsessive‐compulsive spectrum disorder or an affective spectrum disorder.",

      "abstract": "The field of traumatic stress is often referred to as being in a state of controversy and lack of continuity. Throughout history, disputes repeatedly centered on defining the psychological consequences of severe adverse events and on their causes. Even to this day this is current. To understand these controversies, an extensive historical literature review is presented of how mental consequences of trauma have been described in history, of the circumstances in which this took place, and of the disputes that have influenced the conceptualization of these mental responses. We found psychotrauma always being surrounded by controversy. Significant heterogeneity in symptom expression has been described over the centuries to this day. Some symptoms appeared steadily over many decades, but often each time period showed its own core symptoms. At syndrome level, we found an acute condition, one with longer duration, and a complex condition. Also here, definitions varied over the decades. Finally, causes have always been debated, such as biological, psychological, socio-economic, cultural, political, or legal. To better reflect the described ongoing variation in symptomatology, a more flexible diagnostic approach is proposed with a combination of both staging and subtyping that offers room for a more flexible, symptom-oriented, and personalized perspective.",

The depth of depression and the presence of other psychiatric problems are the most significant determinants of the duration of a depressive episode. The number of previous depressive episodes and age at first depression are the most significant determinants of the risk of future depression. However, the presence of interpersonal and social problems, other psychiatric or physical disorders, and the type of depression (e.g. depression as one \"pole' in a bipolar disorder, dysthymia) are also factors of importance.

It is not enough investigated, what kind of disorders they are like, their characteristics are, and how they differ from schizoid personality disorder and continuous sluggish schizophrenia. with the aim to define the clinical features of schizotypal personality disorder 58 patients were examined. Results: • Schizotypal personality disorder is similar to deficit states, observed at schizophrenia, clinically limited to personality sphere, without the signs of flow of endogenous process and psychotic disorders. • Schizotypal personality disorder on the clinical content reminds schizoid, but insignificant ideatory disorders are typical. Dymamic of psychopathy - disposition to decompensation - is never observed. • Schizotypal personality disorder can be diagnosed as latent schizophrenia, because the clinical picture is similar. the special value acquires a dynamic aspect typical of the endogenous process. • High quality remission of schizophrenia limited of specific personality changes, as a variant of «acquired psychopathy» can be considered as clinically identical to «schizotypal personality disorder». Conclusion: A content of Schizotypal personality disorder includes a group of disorders of schizophrenia spectrum, different originally, from shizofreniform personality disorders without the signs of dynamics to the different states of development of schizophrenia - initial (latent schizophrenia), and final (high quality remission of schizophrenia as practical completion of schizophrenia process with the formation of certain features of personality).

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition (DSM‐IV), depression is the persistent presence over a period of at least two weeks of at least five of nine of its cardinal symptoms: depressed mood and anhedonia (of which at least one must be present), clinically significant weight gain/loss or increase/decrease in appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or of excessive guilt, decrease in concentration, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Culture can influence numerous processes interfacing with this disorder, including symptom presentation, prevalence, utilization of services, and selection of and response to treatment.",

      "title": "Movement disorders: a brief practical approach to diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "The characteristic feature of all movement disorders is an abnormality of the form and velocity of movements of the body. The term ‘movement disorder’ has become synonymous with basal ganglia disease and extrapyramidal features. Although many movement disorders do arise from pathology within the basal ganglia, disorders such as myoclonus may also arise from other structures. Abnormality of movement may be the only manifestation of a disease process, or may be part of a more widespread neurological disorder. It is important not to divorce the disorder of movement from general medical problems, since these may be directly or indirectly related (for example, chorea in systemic lupus erythematosus; DIP caused by amiodarone). Basal ganglia disease is commonly associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms and these may have a greater impact upon the patient and their family than the movement disorder itself. An essential first step in the approach to the patient with a movement disorder is to correctly determine the phenomenology of the problem (for example, is the dominant problem chorea or dystonia?). Once this first step has been made, appropriately targeted investigations may then be required to determine the diagnosis. Thereafter, consideration is given to treatment, based upon clinical and social factors, as well as patient preference. This overview will describe a practical approach to the patient with a movement disorder. It will also briefly consider some broad principles in the investigation and management of such cases.",

      "title": "A PRISONER OF WAR SYNDROME: APATHY AS A REACTION TO SEVERE STRESS",
      "abstract": "We have pointed out that one defensive adjustment of POW's to stress is withdrawal. If the stresses are not too severe the person will withdraw physically if possible, or in any case will refuse to allow himself to become involved with the environment to as great an extent as possible. Certain kinds of overt behavior will be inhibited and most emotional responses will be suppressed. If the environment is severely stressful and physically depriving as well, the individual may regress into a more complete withdrawal and adopt a maladaptive state of dependency in which he ceases to take care of himself even to the point of death. We have labelled this type of defense \"apathy\" and distinguish it from states like catatonic stupor, or depression. \"Apathy\" appears not to be a single absolute reaction, but a syndrome which can vary markedly in degree. One major symptom in the syndrome is reduced or modulated affect, but only in extreme cases can one speak of true apathy or affectlessness. Other symptoms are listlessness, uncommunicativeness, lack of spontaneity, indifference, slowed reactions, lack of enthusiasm, and lack of initiative. It is important to note that underlying the overt lack of emotional spontaneity may lie great quantities of pent-up feelings, and that these will continue to be a problem to the individual when he is no longer in the environment that produced the \"apathy syndrome.\" The apathy syndrome serves to maintain personality integration in the face of severe reality and psychological stresses.",

      "title": "Measurement in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "The science of the measurement of mental phenomena (psychometrics) is central to quantitative research in psychiatry. Without appropriate, accurate, stable, and unbiased measures, our research is doomed from the outset. Much effort has been expended over the last 40 years in the development of a bewildering array of assessments. Most of our measurement strategies are based on eliciting symptoms, either by asking the participant to complete a self-report questionnaire, or by using an interviewer to question the participant. Some are long, detailed, and comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessments. Others are much briefer, designed either to screen for probable cases, or as scalable measures in their own right, of a trait or dimension such as depression, neuroticism or cognitive function or as measures of an exposure to a possible risk factor for a disease. Researchers in other medical disciplines sometimes criticise psychiatric measures for being vague or woolly, because they are not based on biological markers of pathology. For this very reason, psychiatry was among the first medical disciplines to develop internationally recognized operationalized diagnostic criteria. At the same time the research interview has become progressively refined, such that the processes of eliciting, recording, and distilling symptoms into diagnoses or scalable traits are now also highly standardized. These criticisms are therefore largely misplaced. Thanks to the careful construction and extensive validation of the better established measures in psychiatric research we can now afford to be slightly more confident of their appropriateness, accuracy, and stability than would be the case even for some biological measurements. This confidence is based on our understanding of the <italic>validity</italic> and <italic>reliability</italic> of our measures.",

Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic. Such designations are certainly open to question. However, they have prevailed, and ought to be retained. They do not indicate that this type of epilepsy has no cause but that, according to the expression of Castaigne (1968), in the case question epilepsy is the very essence of the disease, and",

In most cases, it is benign and disappearswithin six weeks, but approximately 20% of individualswith lumbar pain do not show any improvement in theircondition, which may progress to chronic low back pain.This chronic condition is difficult to manage and iscorrelated with many mechanical alterations (3).Maintenance of postural balance under static or dynamicconditions is essential for any functional activity (4). Inindividuals with chronic low back pain, the degree of controlmay change such that performing daily tasks becomescompromised and the chronic nature of the disease issustained (4-7). The mechanisms that lead to such abnorm-alities of postural control remain unclear. Pain is animportant factor in mechanical and neural alterations, butthe extent to which it influences postural balance still cannotbe determined. One of the hypotheses of this study is that thegreater the lumbar pain and physical disability, the worse thepatient’s maintenance of both static and dynamic posture.Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate thecorrelations between lumbar pain and the degree of disabilityand postural balance among women with chronic low backpain.",

One type of self-reported posttraumatic illness known as chemosensory dysfunction occurs in as many as 24.5% of head trauma victims. Ferreting out individuals pretending to have chemosensory dysfunction as part of litigation for economic gain is a clinical dilemma requiring a multimodal approach. This includes evaluation of historical context, complaints, physical examination findings, chemosensory testing, psychiatric evaluation, and ancillary testing. Long-standing chemosensory complaints seemingly produce or exacerbate psychiatric problems in various ways. As chemosensory problems persist over time, patients may become pessimistic about an eventual recovery and this may lead to depression. Historical clues indicating malingering also include complaints of trauma-induced absolute loss of chemosensory ability. Consistent with his physical findings, both first taste and temporal summation indicate problems within the chemosensory system.",

However, both clinical experience and published evidence show that patients with such disorders also report a series of other symptoms of physical distress, such as fibromyalgia and irritable bladder and alterations in vital functions, such as sleep, libido, appetite and energy level. Some of these extraintestinal symptoms can be explained in the context of an evolving comprehensive disease model which views functional gastrointestinal disorders as manifestations of alterations in the interactions between the nervous system, the viscera and the musculoskeletal system. Alterations in central circuits concerned with arousal, attention and fear, cognitions about bodily symptoms and possible alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis may all contribute to the wide range of symptoms reported by affected patients.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal.

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

      "abstract": "Depression is increasingly prevalent in Western countries. It has severe consequences and is associated with increased rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Despite numerous therapeutic options, a great number of depressed patients do not achieve full remission. In addition, despite good short-term outcomes, long-term therapeutic results remain disappointing and associated with a poor prognosis, raising significant concern in terms of public health. Impaired sleep – especially insomnia – may be at least partly responsible for this problem. Very close relationships between major depressive disorder (MDD) and sleep disorders have been observed. In particular, residual symptoms of sleep disturbance in a remitted patient may predict a relapse of the disease. However, most currently available antidepressants do not always take into consideration the sleep disturbances of depressed patients; some agents long used in clinical practice even appear to worsen them by their sleep-inhibiting properties. But some other new medications were shown to relieve early sleep disturbance in addition to alleviating other depression-related symptoms. This positive impact should promote compliance with medication and psychological treatments, and increase daytime performance and overall functioning. Complete remission of MDD appears therefore to depend on the relief of sleep disturbances, a core symptom of MDD that should be taken into consideration and treated early in depressed patients.",

      "abstract": "Depression: Everyone gets the blues now and then, but when there is little joy or pleasure after visiting with friends or after seeing a good movie, there may be a more serious problem. A depressed mood that stays around for a while, without letting up, can change the way a person thinks or feels. Doctors call this depression.Depression is a common, serious illness and not a personal weakness. Depression can happen to anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. It is never a part of life. Depression, which is treatable, can come from chemical imbalances in the brain, hormonal changes, medications or things going on in your life.Although there has been evidence for some time of a sex difference in depression, relatively little research has examined the developmental process by which women come to be at greater risk than men for depression. One out of four women may have depression sometime during their lifetime. Many people suffer with depression but do not seek help.The sense of one's identity or self is an important dimension of individual's personality giving each one of us unique individuality. Women and depression is holding a relationship of much interest over the last two decades. As more and more women enter the work force, they are increasingly exposed not only of the same work environment as men, but also to unique pressure created by multiple roles and conflicting expectations (Nelson & Burke, 2000). It has long been observed that women are about twice as likely to become clinically depressed (to have dysthmia or unipolar depression) as are men. These differences occur in most countries around the world (Nolen - Hoeksemo & Girgus, 1994; Whilelm & Roy, 2003).Depression is normal features of our lives. Modernity brought women education in its wake and she changed the arena of activity. She stepped out of the threshold ofhouse and joined service like man. Now she got admiration, equality and opportunity. But the euphoria was ephemeral as she was supposed to take to this job as an additional responsibility. She not expected to shrink household work. This brought problems like strain and depression (Pillai & Sen, 1998).A women by nature is expressive emotional and sensitive. Physiological social and cultural background of women probably plays a key role in mending a women's attitude and natures towards the external relation we know that women are generally more at risk to develop psychological disorder and depression in particular.Objectives of the study* To find out effect of age on depression among working women.* To find out effect of experience on depression among working womenHypotheses of the study* There is significant variation in depression among employees based on age* There is significant variation in the depression among the employees based on their experience.MethodParticipantsThe study was conducted in Delhi and Gurgaon, India with a sample of 200 women professionals.

Education was not included as the criteria for selection.InstrumentsBeck Depression Inventory (BDI): The depression scale was made by Beck ward, Mendesion, Moch and Drbauge (1961). It is comprised of twenty one items. Although the inventory was designed as a clinical instrument but in practice it is frequently used to dichotomies subjects in to depressed and non-depressed groups. This inventory has test-retest reliability coefficient ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 on different time intervals and positively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a person r of 0.71.The data collected were analyzed using descriptive one-way analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation test.Results and discussionDistribution of depression based on age: Table 1 depicts the frequency of depression among employees based on age. …",

      "abstract": "El sindrome de Burnout, es un estado de agotamiento emocional, fisico y mental grave en el que la persona se derrumba a causa del cansancio psiquico o estres que surge de la interaccion social y ante una rutina laboral.\r\nSe presenta en profesionales como Medicos, Enfermeras, cuidadores, maestros entre otros, se produce una despersonalizacion, una reduccion de su capacidad personal habitual, en tiempo y frecuencia. Esta situacion se ha ido produciendo durante un largo periodo de tiempo y finalmente la persona se encuentra en un estado de incapacidad para seguir trabajando. Este sindrome se caracteriza por ser un conjunto de factores los cuales afectan inicialmente al hombre en lo psicologico, secundariamente biologico con riesgo s severos de descompensaciones incluso llegando a tener un evento coronario, y con impacto social relevante, ya que afecta directamente en el producto a entregar por el hospital, la satisfaccion del usuario.\r\nEs muy probable que el agotamiento emocional y la indiferencia en el trabajo se traduzcan en ineficacia laboral como resultado de la insatisfaccion y de pobres expectativas personales, por lo que algunos autores como Peralta y Pozo (2011), Yury Rosales (2006) entre otros, consideran que la ineficiencia laboral, es mas bien el resultado del agotamiento emocional, y despersonalizacion que sufre el trabajador con Sindrome de Burnout. Sin embargo, para otros autores (Maitan, N.T.2008), la insatisfaccion laboral y el pobre desempeno en el trabajo se desarrollan en forma paralela y consideran a la ineficacia laboral como una parte integral del cuadro del sindrome.",

A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

The latter considerations contribute to a \"J-shaped\" trajectory from the time of diagnosis. There remain significant challenges to screening for clinical risks associated with psychological symptoms in T2DM; poorer outcomes may be associated with major depressive episodes, isolated (eg, anhedonic), or subsyndromal depressive symptoms, depressive-like symptoms more specific to T2DM (eg, diabetes-related distress), apathy or fatigue. In this review, we discuss current perspectives on depression in the context of T2DM with implications for screening and management of these highly comorbid conditions.",

      "title": "The assessment of mood disorders: new methodological perspectives fordifferential diagnosis",
      "abstract": "This dissertation work aims to provide new methodological perspectives in the assessment of mood disorders, with the main task of suggesting effective solutions for the evaluation of major depressive episode (MDE), in order to support the differential diagnosis of different forms of depression.\r\nMood disorders are the most prevalent of all mental health diagnoses and their incidence has increased in recent decades, becoming one of the most significant public health problem. Many people fail to go to school or university, lose their jobs, lose their partner and friends, and may commit suicide. The course of these disorders as well as their prognosis are closely related to proper diagnosis and well-timed treatment. Despite this, the risk of misdiagnosis is currently high, with serious consequences both for the current episode and for the course of the illness. In particular, the MDE is often classified without specification, also if there are different possible configurations of symptoms that characterize it. Thus, MDE is almost always treated with antidepressant drugs that in some cases (e.g., agitated depression) may increase the symptoms of agitation and the risk of suicide.\r\nThe assessment phase plays a crucial role for the proper treatment of the disorder. Physicians after collecting patients information, need to formulate diagnostic hypotheses in a short time to plan effective clinical interventions. The quality of clinical evaluation is crucial for both diagnosis and treatment.\r\nFormal Psychological Assessment (FPA; Spoto, 2011; Spoto, Bottesi, Sanavio & Vidotto) is a methodology able to maximize the benefits of both semi-structured interviews and self-reports, trying to overcome their limitations. Indeed, the FPA methodological approach allows the construction of:\r\n- Tools that are able to provide qualitative information about patient symptoms that goes beyond the numerical score.\r\n- Tools that are able to differentiate patients who obtain the same score, but replied to different items, and therefore have different symptoms configurations.\r\n- Adaptive tools (as semi-structured interviews) that allow investigating and deepening the patients symptoms.\r\n- Rapid administration as self-report questionnaires.\r\nIn this three-year project at the University of Padua, the FPA concepts have been applied to achieve different aims. \r\nIn a first phase, a methodological analysis of the most used self-report questionnaires of depression was carried out to explore their ability to investigate all the symptoms of the MDE. The research is based on the relationship between items and diagnostic criteria for depression, in line with the FPA methodology. In the second phase, a new self-report questionnaire of 41 items was built on the basis of 23 clinical criteria for MDE from DSM-5 and literature. \r\nIn the third phase, the same questionnaire was validated on non-clinical sample of 265 individuals and clinical sample of 38 patients with MDE diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder. The questionnaire provided good results both in terms of validity and reliability. However, the strength of this tool stands in its ability to go beyond the numerical score, allowing to differentiate individuals with the same score but with different symptoms and possibly different severity of the episode. This property is assured by the patients clinical state (the fundamental concept of FPA) as the main output of the test, which is the set of items the individual replied affirmatively with the subset of symptoms investigated by those items. In this way, clinical evaluation will not only be related to the level of depression obtained from the score but also to the specific configuration of symptoms manifested by the individual. \r\nIn the fourth phase of the research, the computerized algorithm was implemented in the new questionnaire to obtain the adaptive form of the tool. The questionnaire was subdivided into its three sub-scales (affective, somatic and cognitive) corresponding to the three sub factors of the factorial structure. For each sub-scale, through the probability model of the FPA (i.e. the Basic Local Independent Model; BLIM) the false negative, false positives for each item and all the clinical states of the structure were estimated. An interactive procedure was used with maximum likelihood, which provided an estimate of parameters and fit indexes. After being tested on real data, the adaptive form of the tool allows faster and more efficient administration. Indeed, the items to which the individual will respond will depend on previous responses, in a process that mimics the semi-structured interview, avoiding possible logical inferences of the clinician. The new tool called quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Depressive Symptomatology (QuEDS) can be a support for clinicians; in fact, it differentiates the individual's depressive symptoms beyond the score and allows administering only the items related to its symptomatology following the logical flow of question-answer. Thus, two patients who obtain the same score on the test can be treated differently according to their symptoms, since answering the same number of items does not mean responding to the same items. In particular, it is well known that the use of antidepressant drugs is not always recommended in depression. There are mixed depressions, as defined by many authors, because they are characterized by both depressive symptoms and manic symptoms (such as agitation, anguish, irritability, insomnia, mood lability). Two examples of mixed depression are agitated depression and depression with flight of ideas, in which antidepressant drugs not only increase the excitatory component (manic symptoms) worsening the course of the affective episode but, more seriously, increase the risk of suicide. For this reason, understanding all depressive symptoms is crucial in clinical practice. \r\nThe last part of this project was carried out in England, in collaboration with the University of Cardiff and Worcester, in particular with the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (BDRN). The BDRN data used in this research include 3750 mood disorders patients divided into three subgroups: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder Type I (BD-I) and Bipolar Disorder Type II (BD-II). The 29.3% of the whole sample had suffered from an episode of agitated depression (AD), particularly AD was more related to bipolar disorder, especially BD-II. Moreover, patients with agitated depression had higher comorbidities with panic disorder and substance abuse, made greater use of psychiatric drugs, and suffer of more mixed states in lifetime. Agitated depression was related to lifetime suicide attempts and suicidal ideation during the affective episode. These results confirm and strengthen the indications of several other studies on smaller clinical samples. The recognition and differential diagnosis of mixed depression is essential to avoid improper treatment with dangerous consequences.\r\nThe construction of tools to support clinicians task providing the patient symptom configuration with more clinical information can become a strength in clinical practice.\r\nThe tool presented in this work represents a step in this direction; however, to allow differential diagnosis of each MDE, this step needs to be combined to the experience and awareness of the clinician in the field of mood disorders, and especially to the development of further insights in the methodological context. Indeed, as the data demonstrate, the recognition of mixed depression is a difficult task both from a clinical and from a methodological point of view in relation to the construction of suitable and exhaustive instruments. The fundamental issue that remains unclear concerns the ability to investigate the symptoms of manic component that are underestimated by the patient itself (such as racing crowed thought, mood lability etc.) during depression phase.\r\nThe first three Chapters form the theoretical framework, and the starting point for the researches. In the first Chapter, mood disorders are described: prevalence, genetic component, diagnostic classification (major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II, cyclotymic disorder, and rapid-cycle disorder); Also depression is described, followed by mixed depression and the differential diagnosis. Finally, the pharmacological treatment and the etiopathogenetic theories of depression are briefly explained. The second Chapter describes the assessment, therefore the tools most used by the clinician with their strengths and weaknesses; The CBA 2.0 (Cognitive Behavioral Assessment) and Adaptive Assessment are also described. The third Chapter is devoted to the explanation of FPA starting from the mathematical theories to the implementation of the method in the clinical context. Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 describe the four main researches carried out in this PhD project. To conclude, Chapter 8 will present the final discussion.",

      "abstract": "At first glance acute grief would not seem to be a clinical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word, but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. While there has been recognition for some time that certain commonly recurring events have important psychological and situational components, Lindemann's unique contribution has been to provide a theoretical framework by which these events and the human responses to them (adaptive and maladaptive) can be conceptualized, studied and treated. The situational problem conception suggests that casework problems are not really divided into problems that are external on the one hand or internal on the other; it supports the idea that all casework problems have a significant internal aspect.",

      "title": "Mood and affect",
      "abstract": "Readers are grateful to Macpherson and Hikida1 for helping us understand the role of the basal ganglia in various mental disorders. In listing the symptoms of major depressive disorder, they mention, ‘low mood (also known as “flat affect”).’ This is a common mistake. Low mood refers to the feeling/internal emotional state of the individual – it is a symptom. It is a subjective matter and if the individual states that his/her mood is low, we are obliged to accept that assessment (we might, of course, comment that the signs are or are not consistent with the statement). The term ‘affect,’ when used in the assessment of the mental state, refers to the external manifestations of an internal feeling state – here, affect is a sign. (The term ‘affect’ is also sometimes used as an alternative to ‘mood,’ as is ‘affective disorders,’ but this is archaic and not much used currently.) The term ‘flat affect’ was coined to describe a sign of chronic schizophrenia. This largely refers to the unvarying immobile face and slow-moving body often associated with a loss (or absence) of emotional experience/life. It is a negative symptom. But ‘flat’ here is not interchangeable with ‘low’ – the important additional aspect is that the external manifestation does not vary. Where there is flat affect it is usually difficult to get an emotional response (reciprocal emotional response) from the patient. The face and behavior of the individual with a low mood may be similar, at times, to that of the person with schizophrenia with negative symptoms. However, the underlying processes are different. In one there is low mood, in the other there is absence of emotion. The external features (affect) associated with low mood revert to normal when the mood disorder resolves. The flat affect of schizophrenia changes little in response to treatment. Low mood and flat affect are distinct entities – ‘mood’ refers to subjective experience and ‘affect’ refers to objective evidence. Low mood is not always accompanied by psychomotor retardation (which limits facial and bodily movement) and the flat affect of schizophrenia may not be accompanied by low mood. The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",

      "title": "Cross-Addiction: From Morbid Obesity to Substance Abuse",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex phenomenon that continues to defy one unifying scientific explanation. Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

      "title": "A Behaviorist Perspective",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.",
