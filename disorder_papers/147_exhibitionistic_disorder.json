      "abstract": "Pedophilic disorder is defined as having recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children over a period of at least 6 months. Incest, on the other hand, is a sexual activity or assault between family members or close relatives and when towards a child can be defined as the sexual abuse of the child. The concomitance of pedophilic disorder and incest is an important detail which is usually ignored. We would like to emphasize in this case presentation that concomitance of these two pictures are significant in targeted medical and social aspects.",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‐11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

      "title": "Addiction sexuelle ou hypersexualité : 2 termes différents pour une même pathologie ?",
      "abstract": "L’addiction sexuelle débute à l’âge adulte jeune avec un ratio hommes/femmes variant de 2 à 5/1. Le nombre de consultation pour ce motif a augmenté en France mais à ce jour, aucune étude épidémiologique n’a été menée. Différents facteurs déclenchent le comportement addictif sexuel (émotions positives, négatives, circonstances environnementales). La consommation sexuelle est excessive et concerne différents supports sexuels. Il y a au moins un orgasme quotidien pendant au moins 6 mois mais celui-ci s’accompagne toujours d’une perte contrôle, d’une perte de temps à préparer le comportement, le réaliser ou à récupérer de ses effets. Les patients dépendants au sexe se construisent une deuxième vie et sont dans la crainte permanente que cette vie, toujours dissociée de l’amour, soit découverte. La réalisation fréquente du comportement sexuel addictif altère les obligations professionnelles, familiales ou sociales. La notion de trouble hypersexualité repose sur des critères cliniques suffisamment fréquents et intenses pour entraîner des altérations du fonctionnement personnel et social sur une période d’au moins 6 mois : perte de temps ; comportements répétitifs, réalisés en réponse à un état dépressif, anxieux, à un ennui, à des événements de vie stressants ; difficultés répétées pour contrôler ou réduire de manière significative des fantasmes/envies/activités sexuelles ; engagement répétitif dans des activités sexuelles en dépit du risque de conséquences physiques ou émotionnelles pour soi ou pour les autres ; fréquence et intensité importantes des comportements sexuels. Il existe différentes formes cliniques qui sont la masturbation compulsive, la consommation compulsive de pornographie, le cybersexe, les conversations érotiques au téléphone, la fréquentation compulsive de clubs, et la séduction compulsive. Les complications de cette pathologie peuvent être d’ordre somatique, psychologique et social. La prise en charge doit être intégrée et multimodale en combinant thérapie cognitive et comportementale, soutien, approche pharmacologique, thérapie de couple et groupes d’auto-support.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Abstract Child sexual abuse is typically defined as any sort of sexual contact between a child and an adult (or significantly older teenager), including sexual solicitation of, or exposure to, a child by an older person. It may include unwanted and inappropriate physical contact with the child's genitals; sexual touching, manipulation, or fondling; penetration in terms of vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse or attempted intercourse; as well as exposing children to sexual images or forcing them to watch pornography or to witness adult sexual acts. Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‐term psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‐esteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

      "abstract": "Jealousy is a commonly experienced emotion which has been observed in infants as young as 5-6 months of age and across the lifespan of an individual. In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

Responses to infertilityIn response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may affect sexual activity.The stress of infertility and its treatment may also cause sexual difficulties for both men and women.Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem.Post-coital tests or repeated need to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, which can adversely affect his erectile or ejaculatory ability.For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begin a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures.Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress.Some people feel that their partner wants them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control.Such stresses conspire to alienate couples from the recreational aspects of sexual expression and focus them, often obsessively, on the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse.",

      "title": "A Case Report of Zoophilia in Aceh Where Lack of Education and Family Supervision can be a Trigger",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria",
      "abstract": "Persons who experience persistent, clinically significant distress about their anatomic sex or assigned gender role have been recognized since antiquity. In DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013), these individuals can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in adults appear in Box 39- . Persons with presentations that meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in DSM-5 would have received a different DSM diagnosis—usually either transsexualism or gender identity disorder (GID)—prior to 2013. Consequently, some expert recommendations and empirical studies relevant to the treatment of adults with gender dysphoria refer instead to persons with transsexualism or GID. A brief explanation of these terms is therefore indicated. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults 302.85 F64.1 A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months' duration, as manifested by at least two of the following: A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one's experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specify if: With a disorder of sex development (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen insensitivity syndrome). Coding note: Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria. Specify if: Posttransition: The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal female). When disorders involving distress about anatomic sex or assigned gender role first entered DSM in 1980 (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association 1980), they appeared under the superordinate category gender identity disorders. Their defining feature was said to be \"an incongruence between anatomic sex and gender identity\" (p. 261), where gender identity referred to a person's fundamental sense of being male or female. Adults with persistent discomfort about their anatomic sex and a desire to live as members of the opposite sex could receive a diagnosis of transsexualism in DSM-III and DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987). They can still receive this diagnosis in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10; World Health Organization 1992). Males and females with transsexualism are often referred to as male-to-female (MtF) and female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals. In DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000), the diagnosis of transsexualism was replaced by the diagnosis of gender identity disorder ; as a result, this term applied to both the superordinate category and a specific diagnosis within that category. It has long been recognized that not all adults with GID (the superordinate category) have presentations that meet full diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (the specific diagnosis). Accordingly, both ICD and DSM have consistently provided one or more residual diagnoses for persons with nonclassical or nontranssexual types of GID. These diagnoses could be applied to individuals whose presentations fulfilled some but not all diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (i.e., who were subthreshold for these diagnoses) or who had alternative gender identities but did not identify as the opposite sex (e.g., men who identified as eunuchs and sought only castration, not complete sex reassignment; Johnson et al. 2007). In the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria, the new term experienced/expressed gender —a neologism for gender identity —encompasses a wider range of identities than just the opposite sex. Consequently, it appears that many persons who would previously have been diagnosed with residual or nontranssexual forms of GID would now be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. DSM-5 nevertheless includes two residual diagnoses for persons whose presentations do not meet full criteria for gender dysphoria: other specified gender dysphoria and unspecified gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 descriptions of these diagnoses appear in Boxes 39- and 39- . DSM-5 Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.8 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria . This is done by recording \"other specified gender dysphoria\" followed by the specific reason (e.g., \"brief gender dysphoria\"). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the \"other specified\" designation is the following: The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but the duration is less than 6 months. DSM-5 Unspecified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.9 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. Because the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is so broadly encompassing, it is useful to distinguish between adults with gender dysphoria who experience transsexualism and those who experience nontranssexual forms of gender dysphoria. These terms are relatively unambiguous and remain widely used both in clinical settings and in the scientific literature (e.g., Hembree et al. 2009), even though transsexualism has not been a formal DSM diagnosis since 1994. The term transgender can be used to denote persons with significant cross-gender identification or gender-atypical feelings or behaviors, whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.",

      "abstract": "Sexual abuse happens to approximately one in three females and one in five males before age eighteen. This abuse produces many behavioral, emotional, and physical problems in adult life. One such consequence is adult sexual promiscuity. Anxiety which arises over childhood abuse may be dealt with by compulsive or addictive behaviors. Repressed or forgotten abuse may manifest itself in adult life symptomatically by out-of-control behaviors which are abusive of self and/or others. Such compulsive behaviors reflect an attempt to gain mastery over the original abuse and the abuser. Keeping promiscuous behavior secret reinforces lhe original abuse pattern and leads to guilt, shame, and isolation. Countertransference issues facing the therapist are discussed. Four case histories show examples of male and female promiscuity following childhood abuse.",

The suspicions had developed in various ways: through accounts given by the child, through the child's contacts with a person suspected of having abused another child, through a witness or through conclusions drawn, for instance, from changes in behaviour or play patterns of the child. Genital fondling was the most common sexual act reported. The children usually described repeated abuse. The duration of the abuse situation was more than one year in the majority of the cases.",

The most frequent sexual disorder reported by spouses of patients with dementia is sexual indifference related to apathy and blunted affect. Increase of sexual demands is rare and many behaviors considered as inappropriate or expressing hypersexuality actually express affective needs or result from cognitive disturbances. Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families. Information about sex and dementia and a psychobehavioral approach can decrease the strain of families and caregivers.",

      "title": "The Sexually Exploited Child",
      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

Verringert sich auch mit zunehmendem Alter der Anteil derjenigen, die noch Geschlechtsverkehr ausüben, so bestehen neben anderen Praktiken (Selbstbefriedigung) weiterhin sexuelle Fantasien und Wünsche. Männer sind meist länger sexuell aktiv als Frauen. In Partnerschaften besteht eine größere sexuelle Aktivität als bei Alleinlebenden.

Bedeutsam sind die physiologischen Veränderungen und deren Auswirkungen beim Altern.

In these ways it can be recognised as a precursor of the disturbances of sexuality which have been more commonly studied as manifestations of adult emotional life. From the beginning of life physiological growth and functioning can be seen as interrelating with the growth of personality, sensory and sensual experience with infantile 'pre-genital' sexuality, and all linking in many complex ways with the development of character traits and personal relationships. Whereas infantile sexuality is characterised as being experimental and imitative in terms of phantasies about the parental relationship, and predominantly masturbatory in aim, adult sexuality is envisaged as essentially creative and reciprocal.",

      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

Only five children's play with the dolls showed any sexualized quality, in three the source of sexual knowledge becoming apparent. Whereas the absence of sexualized play does not reliably exclude abuse, we suggest that explicit sexual play with the dolls may well arise from previous exposure: to explicit sexual information or activity.",

Meanwhile, the term “sexuality” has come to connote a wide variety of human sociobiological responses that range from varying levels of social attraction or physiological arousal to intimate body contact that may or may not include physical penetration. The failure of research scientists to define what they mean by “sexuality,” “sexual behavior,” or “late life” when designing studies or publishing their results complicates attempts to compare research findings within older age groups and across societies and sociocultural environments. Still, at least five themes emerge as constant premises in the literature concerning sexual desire and activity in later life as defined by some form of mental and/or physical sexual response at age 50 or older.",

The possibility of false allegation needs to be considered, particularly if allegations are coming from the parent rather than a child, if parents are engaged in dispute over custody or visitation, and/or if the child is a preschooler. False allegations may arise in other situations as well, such as the misinterpretation of a child's statement or behavior by relative or caretakers. And children may make false statement in psychiatric evaluations. A case of false allegation of sexual abuse made by mentally retarded 10 year-old girl who has been located in an institute is presented. During her evaluation process, it was clinician's diagnostic impression that she had no been sexually abused but sexually stimulated in some way, and most of what she said was a fantasy lie. Its pathological mechanism is discussed in terms of pseudologia fantastica along with the review of literatures.",

      "abstract": "Infertility may interact with a couple's or individual's sexuality and sexual expression in two main ways. Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility), or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness. Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. ### Responses to infertility In response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may have several effects on sexual activity. The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability. For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begins a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures. Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress. Some individuals feel that their partner seems to want them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control. #### Useful questions to elicit information",

      "title": "Idiopathic Sexual Precocity in the Female",
      "abstract": "Summary From among 11 female cases of idiopathic sexual precocity, 3 have been chosen to exemplify advancement, delay, and normality, respectively, of psychological maturity in relation to chronological age. Like the other cases, they also exemplify coincidence between degree of maturity and variety of life experiences encountered and transacted. Sexually, their psychological development was not predetermined as some sort of automatic or instinctive adjunct to maturation of somatic sexuality. The first report was of a girl aged 8 yr., 6 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at 7 yr., 6 mo. Her apparent psychological precocity was a mixture of three ingredients: superior intelligence, extraordinary fluency in speaking, and unusual breadth of interest and knowledge. Romantic fantasies were frequent and elaborate, but did not include imagery of physical eroticism. Overt erotic behavior was not manifested but, even had it been, the girl would not have been appraised as adult, psychologically. The gulf between infancy and adulthood, with regard to learning and accomplishment, is too great for somatic sexual precocity to have allowed of a dramatic short-cut, even though this girl's speed of psychological development was considerable. The girl was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. The second report was of a girl who, at 6 yr., 4 mo., was well advanced into puberty, but not yet menstruating. Among the sixteen children studied, male and female, she had encountered and tried to negotiate the most overtly baffling and difficult life experiences. Difficulties were engendered chiefly by her father, who was psychosexually disturbed and pathologically suspicious to a degree that many would evaluate as psychotic. The girl was retarded in all-round social, educational, and psychological development. She had trance-like spells of inattention. She made monotonous rocking movements in public. In private, she spent long periods during the day, and in bed each night, twisting and writhing her thighs and legs in automatic fashion. She was appraised as severely disturbed psychologically. The third report was of a girl aged 9 yr., 3 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at the age of 7 yr., 4 mo. Her physical precocity made her seem like a lumbering, overgrown schoolgirl and not like a young lady before her time. She was not in the least disconcerted by the disparity in physical appearance between herself and other schoolgirls of her age. Her achievements, interests, and activities were average and typical for girls of her age with whom she mixed. She was prosaic and literal minded. What few romantic fantasies she had were rather pallid. She manifested no overt erotic behavior. She was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. Recommendations for the rearing and psychological management of girls with idiopathic sexual precocity are substantially the same as those presented with the study of precocity in a boy.",

      "abstract": "Children who are subjected to sexual abuse often endure deep, long-term psychological trauma. Many of them struggle with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sexual dysfunction, and self-harming tendencies. Research shows that children who experience such abuse are significantly more vulnerable to being revictimized sometimes not just once, but repeatedly throughout adolescence and even adulthood. Alarmingly, studies indicate they are up to 35 times more likely to be abused again than those who have not faced childhood sexual trauma. This increased susceptibility is often rooted in feelings of self-blame, worthlessness, and shame.This issue becomes even more disturbing when we look at children who live on the margins of society those without shelter, family care, or institutional protection. Children on the streets, in slums, or those forced into child labor such as rag-picking or begging are especially exposed. With no stable home, adult supervision, or legal protection, these children are not only easier targets for sexual predators, but they also lack the means to report abuse or even understand what is happening to them. For many of them, trauma becomes a silent companion unspoken, untreated, and slowly destructive.",

      "title": "Child sexual abuse : Disclosure, social support and subjective health in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a known risk factor for ill-health. It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae – a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member’s experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This species represents a typical example of protandric consecutive sexuality, the male phase becoming functional at a very early age, when the body has reached a length of only 3 to 7 mm. Those males which become functional earliest usually seek the association of older individuals in the female phase; others, maturing later, are more likely to remain solitary. Mated males have accentuated masculine characteristics and retain the male phase longer than solitary individuals or those that are isolated experimentally. Unfavorable environmental conditions postpone or prevent functional sexuality and terminate the male phase promptly without inaugurating the female phase. The influence of the female in accentuating the sexuality of the male is thought to be due to stimuli received by the latter through sense organs in tentacles and penis and mediated by the nervous system through hormonal secretions. Termination of the male phase and transition to the functional female are comparable to metamorphosis from the immature to the mature condition in other animals and, like metamorphosis, the primary (male) sexual phase can be abbreviated or prolonged experimentally, but the sequence cannot be reversed.",

      "title": "ERECTION DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The first physiological response to effective sexual stimulation, produced by a source of physical or mental stimulation, is the erection of the penis. Erection usually occurs within 3-8 seconds of the onset of arousal. When sexual tension and erection reach a certain level in the presence of the partner, the need for interference appears. The intensity of the erection may increase or decrease until it disappears, whether the arousal is prolonged or not. The complicated anatomical apparatus is regulated by a nervous mechanism, just as complex, being dependent to a remarkable extent on psychic influences. By the strong interweaving of these two components - psychological and functional - the sexual function is subject to changes. Erectile dysfunction, when it occurs, is obvious because, although there may be libido, the lack of an erection makes it impossible to perform sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction should not be confused with isolated or occasional failures to obtain or maintain a penile erection. They do not constitute a condition or disease that justifies medical attention and should be perceived as absolutely normal. The vast majority of men face such an episode at some point in their lives. One can speak of erectile dysfunction in the case of a recurrent or persistent inability to obtain an erection or to maintain it long enough to complete sexual intercourse, which lasts at least three months. It is especially important because in a normal activity, without erection, intercourse, ejaculation and orgasm cannot take place. (Pathologically, premature ejaculation can occur, without an erection, in the form of pollution!)",

      "abstract": "L’adulte handicape cerebral developpe des sentiments d’amour et une vie sexuelle factuelle. En effet, l'adulte, meme cerebrolese (handicap congenital ou acquis) eprouve des desirs erotiques et les assouvit parfois. Les soignants, les familles-et-aidants ne sont pas toujours prepares a ces situations et usent alors de comportements inadaptes. Parallelement l’adulte handicape cerebral se retrouve dependant d’un tiers au regard de sa deficience, qui l’empeche d’assouvir seul ses envies libidinales. Les carences en formation professionnelle et les representations sociales sur le sujet ne les invitent certes pas a une sexualite autonome et normalisee. Mais lorsque la religion prime sur le comportement et la posture des soignants, des familles-et-aidants et des adultes cerebroleses eux-memes, comment vivent-ils leur sexualite ? Cette ouvrage tente une approche theologique de la sexualite des personnes handicapees cerebrales, au regard des quatre grandes religions monotheistes les plus pratiquees en France ; il s’agremente d’entretiens oraux avec six representants des cultes : catholique, protestant, orthodoxe, juif, musulman et bouddhiste.",

Physical states such as hunger and pain elicit crying or other signs of distress, and these indications are reduced or eliminated by food or removal of the aversive stimulus. It makes little difference who or what causes the change in stimulus; one breast or bottle is as good as another, as long as it contains the right stuff. The neonate is nondiscriminatory as to the identity of the agent. By the age of six months, however, the typical infant has begun to discriminate among persons and respond selectively to them emotionally and socially; and well before a year of age, the infant has a well-refined system of response to individual people, including aversions as well as attractions.",

      "title": "Sexual Harassment During a Pandemic and The Legal Consequences It Causes",
      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is unwanted and unwanted behavior or attention of a sexual nature and results in disturbing the harasser. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to: sexual payments for wanting something, coercion of sexual activity, derogatory statements about sexual orientation or sexuality, requests for sexual favors by the perpetrator, speech or behavior that has a sexual connotation; all can be classified as sexual harassment. This action can be conveyed directly or implicitly. The effect is on the victim, who is considered to be causing problems and not the perpetrator. In general, victims will keep their mouths shut, sometimes for a very long time, for these reasons, and there is a fear that they will become targets of abuse. They don't talk about it with friends or family. The healing process will be more difficult when there is denial from the institution, distrust, or blaming the victim. The rampant sexual harassment that is happening in Indonesia is troubling most people. Even during the current covid-19 pandemic, there is an increase in sexual harassment that occurs against women, even worse, it also happens to children who are still underage. Komnas Perempuan identified that during 2001 to 2012, there were at least 35 women who were victims of sexual violence every day. Meanwhile, the data released by Komnas Perempuan during the current covid-19 pandemic is 1,902 cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in Indonesia, as of Saturday, July 3, 2021. In this case, it is clear that there is still a lack of legal protection for cases involving threaten a person's personal personality, especially in cases of sexual harassment to sexual violence.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Gender dysphoria (GD) is defined as a marked incongruence between their experienced or expressed gender and the one they were assigned at birth. Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

The subject was identified as a male at birth, and reared as such in a society in which the differentiation between male and female social roles is more incisive than is generally the case in modern Western society. The appearance at adolescence of gender-incongruent physical secondary sex characteristics, and the comprehensive physical and psychological examinations that were subsequently performed, showed ‘him’ to be essentially feminine, however. Hence, after minor genital surgery, the subject was re-registered as a female and retested 16 months after her reassignment of sex. The subject showed marked improvement in the pattern of serious intrapsychic maladjustment evinced on initial testing, but a deterioration in social behaviour. These findings indicate that differences in psychosexual orientation and behaviour have a biological basis, and are not wholly learned and/or imprinted.",

An earlier view linking sex exclusively with reproductive function has given way to a holistic view of sex as vital to self-concept, the maintenance of healthy interpersonal relationships, and a sense of integrity. Older adults often have difficulty communicating sexual problems, concerns, and questions because of their conflicting attitudes and perceptions. Sexual problems often are presented covertly, expressed in vague terms, or masked by embarrassment. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of covert sexual dysfunctions, clear about their own attitudes and expectations to avoid stereotyping the elderly, and knowledgeable about pharmacological, organic, and psychosocial bases of sexual problems in older patients.",

The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

      "title": "ABC of sexual health: Sexual problems of disabled patients",
      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment—almost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job – people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenceless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behaviour, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

It was concluded that the mating activity is determined not only by sexual stimuli but by non-sexual stimuli as well, and that the decrease in sexual activity characteristic to the old rat can be compensated for by an increase in the non-sexual sensory stimulation of the animal.",

They also engaged in more extensive sexual activity in the laboratory with their dating partner and they reported more undercontrolled or impulsive sexual behavior generally. Furthermore, there was some evidence that the effects of diminished self-control were strongest among those with the strongest sexual desires (men and sexually unrestricted individuals) and among couples with less sexual experience.",

      "title": "A Review on Paraphilias",
      "abstract": "Sexual deviations are disorders in which the individual has fantasies, sexual desires or behaviors that are repetitive and sexually provocative and often include inhumane issues for at least 6 months. Since these people   usually make various legal problems for both themselves and others, this disorder is of special interest. Different models have discussed on the etiology of sexual deviations among of which the special psychoanalysis of Freud have investigated this disorder more comprehensively. In Freudian’s psychoanalysis, sexual deviation has a neurosis structure and shows that sexual deviated has in fact accepted the deprivation of the mother,  but is still trying to return to the bosom of the mother and the denying father. Also, in self-psychology the sexual deviant who has had wrong repeating scenarios in regards to his/hers relationship with parents or as a sadistic seeks to create a temporary and false glorious sense of confidence, to create  a   grandiose self who is self- sufficient and does not need anyone. In many cases body organ justifications are also considered for sexual deviations. Among the examined patients in psychiatric clinics, 74% had hormone level disorders,  27% had neurologic symptoms, 24%, had chromosomal disorders, 9%  had epilepsy, 4% had abnormal EEG, 4% had major psychiatric disorders  , and 4% had mental retardation .Some sources propose 9 identifications for sexual deviation which include: Fetishism, Pedophilia, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Sexual Masochism, Sexual Sadism, Transvestic fetishism, Frotteurism and Paraphilias. The treatment of sexual deviations has great complexity due to its coincidnce with psychiatric disorders such as personality disorders, as well as other factors such as the patients’ shame and modesty and not stating their problems. The treatment of sexual deviation is considered to have four general purposes including a) reducing sexual desires b) giving insight and understanding to the patient c) controlling external stimuli d) treating concurrent disorders.The treatment of sexual deviation involves extensive ranges of biological therapies to mental therapies.  One of the major approaches to psychotherapy in the treatment of sexual deviations is the insight oriented approach that causes a person to improve his interpersonal skills and to find an acceptable method for sexual gratification. Treatment in groups through specific procedures and guidelines and practices can also help the patients. When a person has other psychiatric disorders, pharmacotherapy can treat concurrent biological problems of the individual as well as reducing sexual and obsessive desires. In rare cases where the problem is very serious or causes legal conflicts, surgical treatment is recommended. Keywords: Review, Paraphilias,  Transvestic, Justice, Frotteurism",

When prematures catch up with their birth age they are likely to vanish into the general child population, and the fact of their premature birth is no longer regarded as particularly significant in their behavioral development. The possibility that premature ejection of an individual into a world he has not yet grown up to fit may have lasting social and emotional consequences is an intriguing problem for the student of personality.

      "abstract": "The degree of decrease in sexual activity of the elderly male is, among other things, due to health, age of partner, particularly family status and frequency of sexual activity when he was younger. Affection and contentment become crucial dimensions in experiencing sexuality. Psychophysiological reactions (erection, ejaculation) are protracted and less impetuous. Sexual disorders of elderly people can also be of psychogenic origin. Causative factors are conflicts, loss of interest in the partner, misinterpretation of physiological changes due to age, fears of physical illness through sexual activity, fear of failure towards younger more active female-partners and the like. Skilled psychological guidance is often the essential part of therapy.",

      "title": "The impact of delayed reporting on the prosecution and outcomes of child sexual abuse cases",
      "abstract": "Children and young people who have been sexually abused sometimes disclose that abuse soon after the event or events occurred, or at least later during childhood. However, many children and young people do not tell anyone about the abuse until decades later, long after they reach adulthood. An unknown number, the ‘dark figure’, never tell anyone or if they do, do not report it to the police. Delayed disclosure and reporting are associated with various characteristics of the victim and perpetrator, and the relationship between them. Older children, for example, are more reluctant to disclose than younger children, and boys are more reluctant than girls. Delayed reporting is particularly common in cases of institutional child sexual abuse; for example, where the abuser is a trusted church member, a teacher, or a staff member in a boarding school or residential care facility. In some cases, the victim has told someone at the time, but has not been believed, or the complaint has not reached the police. Where an adult has reported sexual abuse committed against them as a child, particular forensic difficulties stand in the way of prosecution that do not apply to contemporary reports. These include needing to prove the offence as it was on the statute book at the time it occurred, and addressing issues about the reasons for the delayed complaint. Another barrier to successful prosecution is the likelihood of ‘degraded evidence’. As time goes on, memories fade and evidence which may have corroborated some aspects of the complainant’s account may have been lost; for example, due to the death of another witness. This report examines how the criminal justice systems in New South Wales and South Australia deal with complaints of child sexual abuse reported to the police in childhood compared with those in which the report is delayed until adulthood, which is often referred to as historical child sexual abuse. The research investigates the trends in delayed disclosure and reporting of child sexual abuse, and maps the prosecution process and outcomes associated with varying degrees of delay in 18 reporting to the police, together with other case characteristics such as the age of the complainant victim, and the relationship between the complainant and the alleged offender.",

Examples of the same sort of phenomena described by Kluft are repeatedly observed in therapy with members of this population, but usually not in a dramatic form. As might be anticipated, in order to survive, when an individual is closely attached to a long-term and extreme abuser, the sort of enduring ambivalence carried by the victim towards their primary abuser is manifested in compartmentalized states that wish their abuser dead, while other states in equally compartmentalized ways maintain the attachment via the use of sex-by continuing to be sexually involved with their primary abuser (usually their father), by fantasizing about sex with their abuser, by being sexually involved with those who co-abused with their father, or by staging reenactments with individuals whose sexual behavior re-evokes the abuse by the absent (or deceased) father. The process of healing means that inevitably some manifestations of the responses to such abuse spill over into therapy.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s the increase in erotic entertainment has conveyed a clear message: the more sex the better.This has resulted in myths about sexual norms, which if believed may lead to behaviour result- ing in the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases or in sexual dysfunction, or both.The psychosexual problems seen in departments of genitourinary medicine are either secondary to sexually acquired infection or primarily psychological. General reactionsWhen genital lesions are seen, felt, or suspected most patients lose interest in sexual intercourse, or at least restrain themselves for fear of infecting their partners.Those disinhibited by drugs or alcohol or of a psychopathic nature may, however, continue to have inter- course, and particular care must be taken to explain the dangers to others of such behaviour.Marital discord-The innocently infected partner ofa patient who has had intercourse outside a stable relationship may realise the implications of a sexually transmitted disease but may not want the diagnosis spelt out.The doctor therefore should not force the diagnosis on the patient but give him or her room to manoeuvre by saying, for instance, \"Is there anything more you would like to know?\".Often the answer is \"No.\"Anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression-Under the stress of having a sexually transmitted disease the extravert may become angry and the introvert anxious or depressed.Anger may be directed at the clinic staff as well as the person who transmitted the infection.Recognition of this anger may allow the doctor to intervene and discuss the facts and feelings surrounding a patient's illness.This may prevent later violence towards the patient's sexual partner.Unfortunately, in the case of the psychopath such intervention may not alter the patient's strong feelings or the outcome.The neurotic introvert is more likely to become anxious or depressed under stress, particularly when he or she has had intercourse outside a stable relationship.When severe these symptoms must be taken seriously.Clinical anxiety may be dealt with by letting the patient voice his feelings, and later by reassurance.In some patients the anxiety is so severe that a short course ofbenzodiazepines (such as diazepam 2 mg three times a day) may need to be given.Guilt and depression often go together, though most cases of depression seen in clinics are not severe; if necessary antidepressants such as mianserin 30-60 mg at night may be given; the dose should be built up slowly to prevent undue sleepiness in a working person.When the depression is deeper, psychiatric help should be enlisted, but the patient may refuse unless the psychiatrists are on the spot at the clinic.A clinically trivial condition such as recurring non-gonococcal urethritis, as well as the more serious problems of genital herpes, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute epididymitis, and hepatitis B, may all cause anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression.Allowing such patients to air their feelings is vital.",

      "title": "Violência sexual : impactos sobre o desenvolvimento da autoconsciência e autorrepresentações do self no ciclo de vida",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence against children and adolescents, a modality of sexual violence, is characterized as any sexual act or game, established in heterosexual or homosexual relationships, involving one or more adults and a child or adolescent, aiming at sexually stimulating the victim, or using it to obtain sexual stimulation in erotic, pornographic and sexual practices imposed through enticement, physical force or threats. Considered a public health problem and violation of human rights, this phenomenon produces serious biopsychosocial consequences, including feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, impairment of physical and emotional development, making victims more vulnerable to suicide ideas and attempts, as well as psychosomatic illnesses and sexually transmitted. Although scientific studies have pointed out the consequences of sexual violence in childhood and adolescence on the physical and emotional dimensions of victims, little is known about its influence on the development of self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. Based on these assumptions, this study investigates the impacts of sexual violence on self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. It is characterized as a cross-sectional and comparative study, involving two groups of participating subjects, divided between victims and non-victims of sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence. Its sample is composed of 236 subjects, between youth and adults, of both sexes, university students and from different economic classes. The investigation consists of three interlaced studies, the first of which is an ex-post-facto type, in which the participants answered the handout containing a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric instruments; and, the second and third, multiple case studies, of the phenomenal and qualitative type, based on semi-structured interviews, using a thematic script. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, Pearson, Spearman and Pearson Bisserial correlation tests, Student's t test, Multiple Regression Techniques, and Similarity Structure Analysis. The qualitative data followed the interpretative model of the double hermeneutics, proposed by Giddens (1984), by which it is possible to unveil the meanings that the subjects themselves constraint from their actions, compared with the sense that the analysts, from theoretical and methodological constructs build in relation to the actions and interpretations of their interlocutors (Geertz, 1987).. Thus, we sought broader understandings about the impacts of sexual violence on the structuring of self-awareness and self-representations of the self; as well as about the aggravating factors for the occurrence of the phenomenon in childhood and adolescence; and, on the meanings attributed to them by those who have violated their bodies and intimacy, which is fundamental to the most accurate understanding of sexual violence in the life cycle.",

      "title": "An examination of disengagement among elderly people in a low income public housing facility",
      "abstract": "Six general hypotheses guided the development of the study: The older person experiences progressive disengagement from society resulting in feelings of isolation, depression, frustration, and despair; the aging person is dissatisfied with the degree of this process of social disengagement; the aging person gains satisfaction by participating in activities which lead to individual growth and/or benefit to others; the aging person lacks capacity and/or desire to participate in many activities or to continue the full-time roles of parent, job holder, and citizen; the aging person would like to choose his activities according to his desires and needs; and the aging person will more likely participate in activities if he is able to obtain adequate health care and has financial security. Descriptive and statistical inferential tests were used to analyze the data. A relatively small percentage of possible disengagement in the recreational, occupational, and family life areas occurred during the individual's life span from age 40 to age 70. The percentage of possible disengagement in these areas increased dramatically in the life span from age 70. Most of the respondents rejected loneliness and depression and felt in good spirits most of the time. A tendency toward less and less contact with others was seen. Statistically significant differences were found between activities which were presently enjoyed which were basically individual and passive in nature; and activities respondents would plan for themselves, which were of a significantly more social nature involving them in rewarding activity with others. Statistically significant differences were found between interest in the activity program available at Northwest Tower, basically recreation and entertainment; and the activities respondents would include in their program, mainly designed for self-enhancement or benefit to others. Statistically significant differences were also found between the number of activities available and the smaller number desired. The findings suggested that the preponderance of the respondents desired to withdraw from major responsibilities outside their household. Of those who desired responsibilities such as occupation, family or civic, they were prevented from assuming them most of the time because of their increasing age, deteriorating health, and lack of money. These were also the main factors operant in restricting their activity and preventing them from enjoying satisfactory ways of living. The majority of opinions as to society's responsibility to the aging suggested that intervention was necessary to provide financial security, health care, and better and cheaper methods of transportation. The findings of the study suggested the importance of more intensive research in planning programs directly related to meeting the individual needs of elderly people.",

Schizoids are more frequently single, childless and live alone, while hysterics are married, remarried or divorced, have one child and live with their partner and the child. With nearly the same education and intelligence, schizoid patients are more often workers/skilled workers, pupils/apprentices/students or have no profession; hysterically structured individuals, being predominantly women, are more frequently housewives. Nearly half of the most frequent triggering events are equally distributed in both structure groups; these are particularly events signalling a change during development, which, in degree of severity, can just as well be minor threshold situations as serious reverses. With an earlier age of onset, schizoids decompensate significantly more often in \"developmental stages\", whereas hysterical patients are more likely to do so in connection with events of \"love-sexuality\" and those which provoke hysterical anxieties. Of the 15 most frequent events, only 6 each occur in either the schizoids (starting school, puberty, moving away from home, entering into a heterosexual relationship in terms of a casual encounter, beginning an apprenticeship or studies, failure in a test) or the hysterically structured individuals (vacation, marriage, pregnancy/delivery, marital disharmony, extra-marital relationship and severe illness of the patient).",

Sex of assignment and rearing has appeared to be a prognosticator of future gender identity, usually better than the other criteria of sex (chromosomes, gonadal tissue, prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles). The decision to assign a sex is guided by the prognosis of the ``optimal'' sex for the newborn, of which the elements are an overall sex-appropriate appearance with a stable gender identity; good sexual function, preferably combined with reproductive function if attainable; minimal medical procedures; and a reasonably happy life given the limitations. The limited follow-up studies indicate that this is a reasonable policy, although a limited number of subjects will experience gender dysphoria later in life and will cross over to the other sex. This is more often the case in subjects assigned to the female sex with considerable prenatal or postnatal androgen exposure. Children in this predicament must receive guidance well into adulthood. It may be difficult to engage in sexual relations when the anatomy of the genitalia (often operated upon) is not fully normal.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

      "title": "The Psychological and Physical Impact of Sexual Addictions, a Case Report",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is a basic need of every human being. However, it can somrtimes become deviant. Unlike alcohol or drug abuse, suppression of sexual behavior is not an option, only compulsive character must be suppressed in order to allow a full and satisfying sexuality. The purpose of this observation is to explore the psychological and physical consequences of sexual addiction. We report the case of a patient with sexual addiction, in order to describe the impact of this addiction on his psychological and physical health. Mr. JG is 28 a years old man, he has no particular habits and no significant pathological history. He was addressed by his general practitioner for \"excessive masturbation\". His sexual history is characterized by: - An excessive interest in pornographic films since the age of 13, - An extremely rich fantasy life, - Frequent compulsive masturbation, going up to ten times a day. Through the years, this hyper sexuality has become more important, and masturbation more frequent, which resulted in: - Permanent feeling of embarrassment and shame, - Ideas permanently focused on sexual thoughts, - Fatigue and chronical physical exhaustion, - Constant muscle pain and headache, diminished visual acuity. - Relationship difficulties, and social maladjustment, - Depression and suicidal thoughts. The evaluation by the Carnes scale found a score of 16/25, which corresponds to a severe sexual addiction. The boundary between normal and pathological depends on the models and taboos of society, but for physicians, the major criteria for sexual addiction are mental suffering, social maladjustment, and demand of care.",

      "title": "Psychological Aspects of Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. …",

      "abstract": "What is child sexual abuse?Child sexual abuse is any use of children for the sexual gratification of adults.Who abuses and who is abused?The abuser is almost always a male known to the child: a relative (father, grandfather, uncle, or older brother); a member of the household (stepfather or mother's cohabitants); or a temporary carer -for example, teenage male babysitters.Note that abusing males may move after the discovery of abuse to another household of similar composition.Child sexual abuse may occur in any part of society but is discovered more commonly in poor families.Children of all ages and either sex may be sexually abused. What happens?Sexual abuse entails all types of sexual activity often with escalating intrusiveness.Children may be exposed to indecent acts, pornographic photography, or external genital contact in the form of being fondled, masturbating an adult, or being used for intercrural intercourse.Finally, they may be penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally.How often does sexual abuse occur?Nobody knows how often sexual abuse occurs.It is certain that a lot of abuse is undiagnosed and equally certain that false diagnoses may be catastrophic.Five main risk factors predispose to child sexual abuse.* Previous incest or sexual deviance in the family * New male member of the household with a record of sexual offences * Loss of inhibition due to alcohol * Loss of maternal libido or sexual rejection of father * A paedophilic sexual orientation, especially in relation to sex rings and pornography. Do children tell?Sometimes children tell other people, but many are threatened to stop them telling.They may receive compensatory treats or presents.",

Gender labeling, gender identity, sex-typed toy preferences, and awareness of adult sex role differences were observed in significantly more 26-month-old children than would have been expected by chance. Verbal gender labeling was observed in a majority of 26-month-olds, while verbal and nonverbal gender identity were observed in a majority of 31-month-olds. Nonverbal gender labeling and awareness of adult sex role differences were observed in a majority of children by 36 months. No evidence of awareness of sex differences in children's toys was found in the majority of children at any age. Awareness of sex role differences in children's toys was not related to awareness of adult sex role differences. Brighter children were more aware of adult sex role differences. Sex-typed toy preference was not related to awareness of sex role differences but was related to gender identity. Predictors of sex role development included the mothers' employment, and the father's personality traits, attitudes toward women, and sex-typed activities in the home. Implications for theories of early sex role development are discussed.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is defined as fear or worry to a perceived, imminent challenge or threat either in the present or the future. The experience would be an exaggeration in the perception of situational threats. This may cause muscular tension and guarded behaviors. The prevalence of anxiety among adults in Pakistan is 34% (range 29-66% for women and 10-33% for men).1 There is a high prevalence of anxiety in adolescents more in male gender, 22.5% 2, and an estimate of 65% in the shelter homes and 51% in the community samples of children.3 Variation in anxiety is attributable to the difference in perception and symptoms related to a threatening situation. For example, Generalized Anxiety is characterized by excessive worry about numerous things. In Social Anxiety the individual is fearful or avoidant of social interaction and situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized. Separation Anxiety refers to fear of separation from an attachment figure. Stage Fright is characterized by a consistent failure to speak at public occasions. Among students it is common to experience Exam or Performance Anxiety, which falls under the umbrella of generalized anxiety disorder. Performance anxiety presents with worries about failure in regards to accomplishing something specific or a fear of failing to perform effectively in similar situations. It is generally noted that anxious students perform poorly and are less motivated in highly evaluated exam situations as compared to a relaxed student.4 Multiple factors can lead to the development of anxiety among students negatively impacting their performance that include; self-doubt, insufficient preparation, fear of scrutiny, and facing failure.5 Anxiety is curable and at the same time treatable. Anxiety gets worse when not attended to by engaging with appropriate services. Among students, clarity in their study goals and a stepwise approach towards their future goals can help ease the burden and the tension (anxiety) about it. A good routine and healthy eating habits have always been noted with mental well-being. Conducting a self-evaluation to determine one’s strengths and areas for improvement and adopting a clear, feasible study plan coupled with consistency has been proven very effective.",

But it was in the first quarter of the twentieth century, with the diffusion of psychoanalytic theories in the human sciences and hence in general culture, that the concept of sexuality acquired its present range, designating a series of excitations and activities, and found as united or isolated components in the erotic behavior, conscious or unconscious, said to be normal, of adult human beings. Erotism is human sexuality freed of any project of reproduction, any compulsory genitality. It enables enjoyment to be independent of any biological function and makes it autonomous in such a way that all pleasure in eating, drinking, or working will arouse the suspicion of a hidden erotism.",

Es gibt aber auch körperlich gesunde Männer, die in ihrem Leben bei einem versuchten Koitus keine Erregung hatten. Ihre sexuelle Reaktion ist derart gehemmt, daß sie daran zweifeln, jemals sexuelle Befriedigung mit einem Sexualpartner zu finden. So kann zum Beispiel ein Junge von einer besitzergreifenden Mutter erzogen worden sein, die ihm niemals gestattete, sich selbstständig zu entwickeln. Oder es wurde ihm beigebracht, daß Sexualität etwas schmutziges, gefährliches sei. Versagt er dann beim ersten Koitus, so kann er unfähig werden, die negative Erfahrung zu überwinden. Ein anderer Mann verspürt möglicherweise homosexuelle Tendenzen; dieser zu bewältigende Konflikt kann zum Versagen führen. In diesen Fällen ist eine intensive Sexualtherapie erfolgversprechend, denn der Betroffene benötigt mehr Hilfe als er von seiner Partnerin erwarten kann. Tritt eine Sexualstörung vorübergehend auf, sind die Partner am besten beraten, zunächst die Situation zu akzeptieren und sich klar zu machen, daß ein Mann nicht zwingend eine Erektion benötigt, um die Partnerin zu befriedigen. In den meisten Fällen wird ein Mann ein anderes Mal, unter günstigeren Bedingungen, wieder eine Erektion bekommen.",

Their meaning is generally left to a reader's intuitive understanding. The term sex may be used to indicate male or female anatomy, the general distinction between male and female genders or between distinctive masculine and feminine behaviors attributed to the two genders, to activities leading to orgasm (8,9) or to penile/vaginal intercourse and reproduction. Sexual and sexuality are used with equal imprecision, referring to the sexual organs, to functions of sexual organs, to sexual drives, or to instincts. Gender, gender identity, and gender roles, on the other hand, have precise definitions derived from recent conceptualizations in psychosexual research. Gender usually indicates the equivalent of male or female anatomic sex. Gender identity refers to one's personally experienced sexual identity, a persistent individual self-awareness of being either male or female without regard to how or with whom one expresses this identity.

      "abstract": "Sexual activity is a vital principle of human living that connects the desire, energy and pleasure of the body to a knowledge of human intimacy, for the sake of erotic love, intimate friendship, human mating and procreation. Sexuality is the capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. The World Health Organization's International Classifications of Diseases defines sexual problems as ways in which an individual is unable to participate in a sexual relationship as he or she would wish. There are four major categories of sexual problems: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders. Sexual arousal disorder in men, erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity.Orgasmic disorders In men, premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. Sexuality has been explained in the Ayurveda classics in detail along with the various disorders related to desire, arousal, orgasmic and sexual pain disorders. The various formulations have been explained in classics to relieve these disorders and help the man to enjoy their sexual life.Considering these issues the need of hour this conceptual study has been carried out to help, support and provide enhanced sexual life with readily available pure botanicals which are time tested evidenced based and 100% safe and effective.",

The physiological sexual response depends not only on intact vascular, endocrine and neurological pathways, but also on sensory input. During sexual penetration the vagina lengthens, the labia increase in fullness, the uterus draws back and the clitoris retracts. In a population-based survey, vaginismus was seen in 6 percent of the 37.9 percent of women who reported sexual problems. Primary vaginismus is diagnosed when nothing has ever entered the vagina. Secondary vaginismus occurs often after vulvovaginal trauma such as infection, childbirth, malignancy or its treatment, or sexual trauma such as rape or abuse. Dyspareunia is pain on sexual intercourse. This applies to any form of sexual vaginal penetration, not only with the penis, but other objects such as fingers or sex toys.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of psychiatric histories of 56 women from the age of 45 to 60 diagnosed as monopolar depressions demonstrates the incongruence of natural-scientific and interpreting (hermeneutic) competence. In 60% of the cases no details about the gynecological anamnesis could be found; in 36% informations about the sexual selfperception by the patients were available; these informations were not placed under a specific category of anamnesis but scattered throughout the text and left a exigency of interpretation. Gynecological pains in a wider sense appeared in half of the cases. These datas are put in the frame of a specific, socially preformed idea of female aging, which indeed gives place to the here studied depressive syndrome, but not to a suitable mode of expression according to age, sexual desire resp. female individuality. The term of \"ideal motherliness\", i.e. a motherliness without the obligation to produce children, is introduced here as a possible therapeutic and social criticism. The interdependence of sexual mode of expression on one side, which is granted or not granted from a certain age on, of psychiatric symptoms becoming relevant and a fitting niche on the other is called 'ecology' with regard to the said background and according to Bateson. So the dysfunctional stabilization of the patient is regarded as a reflexive kind of way.",

Females are reported victims of sexual abuse much more often than males. The peak age of onset of sexual abuse for females is prepubertal—7 or 8 years of age—and the average duration fends to be about 2 years. The basic theme of this article is that there may be directly traceable mechanistic relationships between the impact of sexual abuse on specific psychological and biological developmental processes for females and some of the adult outcomes of that abuse. Specifically, it is proposed that, to understand the long-term impact of sexual abuse, it is necessary to investigate how it may interfere with both the psychological and the biological processes of pubertal development.",

Students at academic institutions often sexually harass others by calling them “fag, ” “homo, ” “Hey, babe, ” “Hot stuff, ” or “Big stud” or other degrading terms that refer to sexual orientation. Additional types of sexual harassment include students starting or spreading sexual rumors, writing sexual graffiti on bathroom walls, sending crude e-mails or letters, and displaying sexual drawings or pornography. A person in a position of power may request sexual favors in return for a starting position on a college team, a higher grade, or access to a popular club or peer group.

Sexual disorders are divided into those that have been lifelong (called “primary”) and those that developed during adulthood (“secondary”). In addition, there are three general categories of difficulties: disorders of desire, disorders of arousal, and difficulty attaining orgasm. Many medications, including psychoactive medications, can affect sexual appetite and/or sexual performance significantly. Healthcare professionals should look up the possible sexual side effects of each medication that a patient is taking. The evaluation of an individual with sexual problems requires a sophisticated integration of knowledge from many areas, as biological, psychological, and social forces all strongly influence sexual functioning. Establishing a safe, non-judgmental interview setting will facilitate frank discussion of sensitive, private sexual matters.",

      "title": "To the limits of male heterosexuality: the vagina-man",
      "abstract": "The men I describe in this paper may go through life without acknowledging any difficulty with their heterosexuality. They are intelligent, gifted and usually untroubled by the variations of their sexual drives, or the occasional fleeting interest in people of their own sex. Their femininity, only faintly noticeable to others, is as a rule well integrated and often put to good use in their professional lives. On the debit side, although they are capable of fairly lasting and deeply satisfying relationships with women, we find a high divorce rate and frequent changes of partners. Some of them can be exceptionally promiscuous, exploiting their capacity to attract women in a wholly effortless manner. Their promiscuity has a striking oral quality, in so far as they give the impression of being sexually insatiable, thus confirming the psychoanalytic observation of the equation penis=mouth. Many of them are little affected by an orgasmic incompetence which is hidden by a reasonable sexual performance. All these men are incapable of a full homosexual contact, though some have experimented with boys in childhood or early adolescence, but never intensely.",

Por otro lado, cuando la salud fisica de una persona se ve comprometida por una enfermedad terminal, esta influye de manera trascendental en la vida la persona; la sexualidad puede verse afectada por importantes factores organicos, psicologicos y socioculturales, que inciden en el pleno disfrute de la actividad sexual en el sujeto. Las disfunciones sexuales son alteraciones en la sexualidad, que generalmente estan presentes en paciente terminales y usualmente afectan la respuesta sexual en la fase del deseo y la excitacion. El tratamiento farmacologico administrado a los pacientes con enfermedades terminales, es importante para su recuperacion, sin embargo, puede llegar a producir ciertas disfunciones que se ven exacerbadas por sintomas psicologicos como el proceso de adaptacion a la enfermedad, creencias que existen en torno a la sexualidad y las condiciones particulares de cada enfermedad terminal, esto determina cierta dificultad de mantener relaciones sexuales satisfactorias. Pese a que no existe un modelo determinado para intervenir en estas manifestaciones negativas que presenta la funcion sexual, se menciona un modelo que emplea tecnicas con el objetivo de fomentar bienestar en el sujeto.",

However, from a review of the cases of 53 male self-mutilators, it appears that a significant number involve individuals not psychotic at the time of the act but rather having character disorders and rageful feelings toward themselves or women, and transsexual males who premeditate their own gender conversion surgery. The psychiatric consultant's role in the management of such an individual in the general hospital setting includes not only care of a patient with a psychotic or impulse disorder but also involves support of the house staff, who are distressed by the fear, guilt, hopelessness, anger, and revulsion that the patient's act of genital self-mutilation causes.",

      "title": "Academic and Behavioral Problems of Boys in Elementary School",
      "abstract": "The development of a boy's sex role begins shortly after birth when he is assigned certain colors due to his gender. By the time the boy is eighteen months old, adults are expecting clear sex differences in his behavior. Subtle and not so subtle pressure is put on the child to produce sex differences. The pressure is from a wide variety of sources such as type of toys purchased, clothing provided, decoration of his room, and his interactions with family members and other significant adults. Consequently the boy's preference for guns, wheeled toys, running, and aggressive play appears at or before age three. By the time the boy enters elementary school at age six, he has a strong notion of the masculine behaviors expected of him. Modification of sex roles to accommodate the expectations of the school is one of the more difficult tasks facing elementary school aged boys. As they enter school, boys are required to assume a second role, that of a student. However, the behaviors implicit in many boys' sex roles are oppositional to the behaviors required in the student role. The conflict results in the boy not successfully assuming the student role, and may result in the boy being identified as having an academic and/or behavioral problem. Considerable research indicates that a large percentage of boys are experiencing difficulties in the schools. The present article will explore the reasons boys are involved in such frequent problems in school, and will make recommendations for persons working with elementary school aged boys.",

      "abstract": "The article describes causes of hypoactive sexual desire, which is associated with: tiredness and emotional overstrain; multiple abortions; rave for a person who is not a member of this couple of spouses/partners; criticism of physical qualities of one’s male/female partner; disturbance of interpersonal relations in the couple of spouses/partners; loss of sensuous charm caused by habituation; preference of masturbation over sexual intercourses; disregard for sexual needs of a woman; reproaches of sexual nature; conflicts of one spouse with parents of another one; age factor; sexual problems of one’s partner and his/her health condition; negative body image; presence of sexual or emotional abuse in the anamnesis; loss of job; severe loss. It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one’s male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of great physiological and psychological change. Individuals have to progress from the dependence of childhood to the independence and maturity of the adult state whilst they are still regarded by many adults as predominantly children. Adolescents have to cope with the central problem of identity and of motivation and ambitions. They have to come to terms with the perceptions and judgements of other people on them and often experience stress in situations where they feel they are unable to reach the ideals of themselves or of others. Relationships with the opposite sex and acceptance by friends become crucial since they are the only means of judging one's self-value until the individual has achieved a reasonable degree of confidence and self-integration. This dependence on the opinions of others or on perhaps inappropriate ideals can lead to strong feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in adolescents. Adults obviously face similar problems but the myriad of physical and physiological changes which adolescents experience serve to heighten their emotional sensitivity. As a consequence of these adjustment problems, adolescence is often a period of unrest, of questioning and sometimes of outright rebellion and hostility.",

      "title": "The Sexual Exploitation of Missing Children: A Research Review.",
      "abstract": "This review based upon empirical research findings examines the prevalence, dynamics, and short- and long-term effects of sexual exploitation of missing children. Three categories of missing children are studied: runaways, the largest group of missing children; victims of parental kidnapping; and victims of family abductions. Between 11 and 23 percent of runaways become involved in prostitution; once involved in prostitution, runaways are more vulnerable to rape and pornography. Runaways at the most risk of engaging in prostitution are those who leave home frequently and longer each time, those with a history of serious sexual abuse, those from dysfunctional families, and males who describe themselves as homosexual or bisexual. There is no evidence that victims of parental abduction are at greater risk of sexual exploitation than children in the general population. Sexual abuse sometimes accompanies nonfamily abductions, but public fears may have exaggerated this connection; when sexual abuse does occur during nonfamily abduction, the effects on these children are probably quite severe and long lasting, with the presence of many symptoms more than 4 years later.",

      "abstract": "This discussion of psychosexual factors in infertility focuses on the following: sexual dysfunctions in infertility (impotence ejaculatory impotence premature ejaculation vaginismus orgasmic dysfunction); coital factors in infertility (coital frequency coital error effluvium seminis coital technique); effect of infertility on psychosexual function; clinical aspect of psychosexual problems and infertility; and management. The importance of sexual problems as a cause of male infertility has been emphasized by Dubin and Amelar (1972). The etiology of sexual dysfunction is primarily psychogenic but functional and organic pathology may also be involved. If primary sexual failure occurs in 1 partner it can produce dysfunction in the other. Sexual dysfunctions usually are psychosomatic disorders. Both the vasocongestive and the orgasmic components of the sexual response may be inhibited together or separately. Macleods study indicates that at almost any age the chance of conception being achieved in less than 6 months rises with the frequency of intercourse yet Dubin and Amelar reported 6 cases of male infertility due to too frequent ejaculations. Daily ejaculation may have no clinically significant effect on the sperm count of a man who normally has a high sperm concentration. Effluvium seminis is a common phenomenon and is not a cause of infertility but a woman cleaning or douching herself immediately after intercourse is not encouraged for subfertile women. The best coital position for achieving conception is that of the male above with the female lying supine underneath. Infertile couples undergo much stress when they are unable to conceive. Many couples may find that their sexual pleasure and functioning become impaired. Infertile couples may have abnormalities in sexual functioning which can present in several ways: as psychosexual problems causing infertility; as infertility resulting in psychosexual dysfunction; or as incidental findings of psychosexual disturbances in cases of infertility. In the management of infertility associated with psychosexual problems the doctor must have an empathic understanding and nonjudgemental attitude and should be ready to encourage the couple to speak openly about their anxiety in a relaxed confidential and private setting. The couples attitudes concerning sexual behavior must be identified and help must be provided to modify them when appropriate.",

      "abstract": "Given that the prevailing literature largely neglects the unwanted sexual activity experiences of men, this study examined both prevalence and predictors of men's compliance with unwanted, but consensual, sexual activity. Specifically, we examined whether traditional gender-role endorsement, belief in male sexuality stereotypes, and age predict sexual compliance among heterosexual men. Participants (N = 426 men) completed a brief demographic questionnaire, measures of gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes, as well as a modified measure investigating motives for consenting to unwanted kissing, sexual touching, oral sex, and/or penetrative sex. The reported incidence rate of mild sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to unwanted kissing at least once) in heterosexual men was 61.3% over the past 12 months. Results suggest that sexual compliance in heterosexual men may be predicted by their endorsement of traditional gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes. Moreover, men may be motivated to be sexually compliant due to motives of altruism, intoxication, sexual inexperience, peer pressure, popularity, and sex-role concerns.",

El impacto emocional puede ser profundo, y muchas veces subestimado por los equipos de salud, afectando la calidad de vida y el proceso de recuperación del paciente. En muchos casos, los pacientes reportan sentimientos de despersonalización y pérdida del atractivo físico, lo cual afecta su autoestima y sus relaciones interpersonales. Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de síntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirugía de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptación es también común, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentación, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo físico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminución del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones íntimas. Así mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en público. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta clínica que trascienda lo técnico y abrace la dimensión humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucción de la identidad psicológica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, será posible favorecer una adaptación saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena más allá de la ostomía.

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment describes the human infant's tendency to seek comfort, support, nurturance, and protection from a relatively small number of preferred caregivers or attachment figures. The capacity to form an attachment is not present at birth, but develops over time. Although infants in the first 6 months are able to distinguish among different interactive partners, they do not express an obvious preference for one caregiver over another. All of this changes at around 7 to 9 months of age. At that point, infants begin to exhibit stranger wariness and separation protest, two behaviors that herald the onset of focused attachment. Stranger wariness varies from mild reticence to outright distress, but it contrasts with the infant's comfort with an attachment figure, from whom the infant seeks comfort, support, nurturance, and protection. Separation protest describes the infant's reaction to actual or anticipated separation from an attachment figure. After these two behaviors appear, infants are attached to one or more caregivers. Once infants have developed the cognitive capacity to exhibit separation protest and stranger wariness, they may form new attachments with any caregivers with whom they have significant interactive experiences.",

      "title": "Section I: General Aspects",
      "abstract": "Normal male sexual function depends on the sexual response cycle, which consists of an anticipatory libidinous state (sexual motive or desire), effective vasocongestive arousal (erection), orgasm, and resolution (detumescence). Libido is defined as the biological need for sexual activity and frequently is expressed as sexseeking behavior. Its intensity is variable between individuals as well as within an individual over a given period of time. Little is known about the physiological basis of libido. Erection, however, is associated with significant psychological and physical changes. This is the ultimate response to multiple psychogenic and sensory stimuli from imaginative, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and genital reflexogenic sources, which trigger several neurological and vascular cascades that produce penile tumescence and rigidity sufficient for vaginal penetration. The sensation of orgasm is accompanied by two sequential functions: emission and ejaculation. Emission, mediated by contractions of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and urethra, produces a sensation of ejaculatory inevitability and deposition of semen in the posterior urethra. Generalized muscular tension, perineal contractions, and involuntary pelvic thrusting (every 0.8 seconds) usually follow and lead to the expulsion of semen from the urethral meatus. The resolution phase returns the penis to the flaccid state and provides a sense of general pleasure, well-being, and muscular relaxation. During this period, men are physiologically refractory to subsequent erection and orgasm for a variable amount of time. (For further information on normal male sex physiology, see Chapter 3.)Disorders of the sexual response may involve one or more of the cycle’s phases; these may be generalized or limited to certain situations or partners or may be lifelong (i.e., there has been no evidence of any effective sexual performance, generally due to persistent intrapsychic conflicts) or acquired (dysfunction arises after a period of normal function). Although there are no universally acknowledged defining criteria, a period of persistence over three months has been suggested as areasonable guideline for clinical concern. Isolated dysfunction of the erectile mechanism is the most common problem, but generally, disturbances may occur in some or all of the subjective components of desire, arousal, and pleasure and the objective components of performance, vasocongestion, and orgasm, although any of these may be affected independently.",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job  people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenseless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behavior, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

Moreover, frotteurism is a common phenomenon among the general population which usually goes unnoticed or overlooked. Nevertheless, public frottage has legal implications in almost all countries over the world. But, when frotteurism manifests on the backdrop of psychiatric illness or as a developmental abnormality then it is worth discussing what the legal liability would be. The present case report is based on hypersexual frotteuristic behaviour manifested on the background of a concealed psychiatric illness, featuring depression and obsessive compulsive disease. The hypersexual behaviour manifested in the form of masturbation with features of frotteurism and subsequent development of depression. Nevertheless, compulsive manifestation of frotteuristic behaviour and subsequent development of morbid depression is rare. This paper describes a 12-year-old boy having unrestrained impulsive frotteurism with his peers, school mates and with his younger brother. He was conscious of the fact and feeling guilty of what he was doing but unable to restrain himself. It was followed by the development of symptoms of depression which was treated with Sertraline. Concurrent psychiatric counseling and rehabilitation measures were taken too. There was complete remission of the symptoms 6 months after the onset of treatment and without relapse thereafter. The paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of hypersexual behaviour.",

Kinsey estimated that 1.9% of all 40-yr-old men are impotent, which is greater than initially reported by Kinsey if mild, moderate, and severe erectile dysfunction (ED) are considered. Nearly 40% of men suffer from ED by age 40 and the percentage increases to > 75% by age 70.",

The are diseases of the genetic sex (genetic anomalies, eg. Turner syndrome), diseases of the gonads (hermaphroditism), anomalies of internal and/or sexual organs (pseudohermaphroditism). Recently, the troubles of sexual behaviour could be considered as pseudohermaphroditism, because there is missing the consensus generated by what is considered as conventional normality in biology (the average plus/minus 2 standard deviations). The lack of pubertary sexual development (late puberty) or precocious development complete the consensus of the 6 sexes.",

Individuals with ASD face unique difficulties regarding sexuality, often experiencing mismatches between sexual development and social maturity, leading to potential inappropriate behaviors. Social competence deficits may limit their understanding of sexuality, increasing risks of offending or victimization. Gender differences in sexual behavior are evident, with males showing earlier and more frequent sexual activity, while females demonstrate greater flexibility in sexual orientation. This paper presents six clinical cases highlighting the diverse experiences of sexuality and gender identity in autistic individuals, offering insights into the complex interactions between ASD, gender, and sexual behavior.",

Sixty-six focal children at 18, 24, or 30 months of age were observed at home with familiar peers and then again 6 months later. Episodes of peer interaction were analysed for instances of sharing. The predicted decline in sharing with age was qualified by cohort differences and many associations with gender. Most children shared less as they grew older, but the oldest girls slightly increased their rate of sharing over time. As peer relationships developed, girls were more likely to share with other girls; boys were more likely to show reciprocity in sharing. Individual differences in sharing were moderately stable over time and linked to another form of prosocial action, sensitivity to the peer's distress. As predicted, children who shared at higher rates were rated more negatively by their mothers. The positive relationship between prosocial action and mothers' ratings of negative personality traits was especially strong for boys.",

This includes: the management of the anatomy, physiology and sexual behaviourof the young boar, that influences its performance as an adult. Normal reproductive activity in boars is coordinated by the endocrine and nervous system. Abnormal activity in one or more of these areas can result in reproductive problems. For the development of the sexual behaviour is important to considerer plays and social conditions of rearing of penmates. Play in animals is common in mammals, frequent in young and is not oriented to satisfy the immediate needs and carries appreciable costs in energy, time and even physical risk. Although, play contributes to the development of several functions that take place in the adult. Sexual behavior begin as early as 1 month of age in boars; mounting activity of penmates is observed more frequently for males than females. Some authors emphasized the importance of social conditions during rearing, due to the sexual activity showed in pubertal boars.",

Nowadays Klaibya is considered as one of the most common problems affecting the males having variable severity. Change in lifestyle, food habits, sedentary lifestyle and some psychological causes like Chinta, Shoka, Bhaya, Krodha etc. causes Klaibya. The male sexual dysfunctions have been elaborately described as Klaibya (Impotency) in Ayurvedic classics. In clinical practices Klaibya (Impotency) is the most common psychosexual disorders. It has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patients along with their partners. It is projected as a medico-social problem. Vajikarana, a specialized branch of Ayurveda deals in treating these problems. It refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual cycle that restricts the man from experiencing satisfaction from the activity. Nowadays the incidence of sexual dysfunction is increasing due to age, sedentary life style, unhealthy foods etc. About 5% of 35 years old men and between 15% and 25% of 50 years old men experience sexual dysfunctions. Vajikarana (Medicine which improves sexual capability) branch of Ashtanga Ayurveda (one of the subjects of Ayurved study) deals with fertility, potency and healthy progeny. In this branch diagnosis and management of infertility and Sexual dysfunction are dealt in detail.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The problems of adolescents’ sexual behavior are grave and far-reaching. Methods: Review of exiting literature via Google scholar, AJOL, Pubmed, HINARI and other relevant data bases on the common problems of adolescents’ inappropriate sexual behavior. Result: Adolescent sexual behavior could result in adolescent pregnancy which prevalence varies widely throughout Nigeria perhaps due to differences in culture and development. Abortion, the willful termination of pregnancy is another problem which is often undertaken for pregnancies resulting from incest and sexual abuse. Also common is trans-generational sex which occurs when an adolescent has non-marital sex in the last 12 months with a man who is at least 10 years older than her. Also related to this, is transactional sex found in both committed and casual relationships. It is not always done for survival because in some cultures, sex for favor is carried out for reasons other than subsistence. Furthermore, multiple sexual partners are the engagement in sex with more than one partner over a particular time frame. It may be sequential or concurrent. The high prevalence of these problems in Nigeria raises a question of the possibility of achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) 4, 5 and 6 specifically targeted at reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases respectively. Conclusion: Policies and strategies such as family life and HIV/AIDs education (FLHE) curriculum on adolescent reproductive health should be pursued with greater vigor in our secondary schools in addition to establishing HIV counseling centers and vocational training programs for out-of-school adolescents. WHO support and commitment to key action areas for countries and member states will build and strengthen their capacity to improve reproductive and sexual health.",

In this study, 459 unmarried, heterosexual undergraduate students (female = 328; male = 131), aged 18 to 25 years, from three universities completed an online questionnaire about their behaviors with technology and romantic relationships. In general, low attachment avoidance and high fear of negative evaluation from the dating partner predicted sending a sexually suggestive photo or video, sending a photo or video in one's underwear or lingerie, and sending a sexually suggestive text. High fear of negative evaluation predicted sending a nude photo or video as well as sending a text message propositioning sex. Low attachment avoidance, greater fear of negative evaluation, and greater social distress when dating were associated with sexting behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Dentro de la cultura salvadorena, se comparten diversas ideologias sobre las actividades y comportamientos que se producen al momento de relacionarse con los demas; cuando una ideologia es compartida por la mayoria de las personas esta se convierte en norma y se mantienen un orden relativamente logico y adecuado para la convivencia. Esta dinamica supone la construccion de una serie de valores morales que trastocan y definen areas significativas en la vida de las personas. Sin duda alguna una de las areas de mayor trascendencia y que se ha visto coartada en diferentes aspectos y medidas, es el area de la sexualidad. Es por ello que en los ultimos anos se ha mantenido un continuum de informacion discrepante en cuestion de propaganda sexual e informacion formal sobre el tema, sobre todo de parte de los medios de comunicacion y ultimamente por medio de las redes sociales; naturalizando actitudes poco saludables, separando la afectividad del ambito sexual, y reduciendo esta ultima al mero contacto fisico, eyaculacion, orgasmo y el conocimiento de la composicion fisiologica humana o metodos de anticoncepcion, relegando a un segundo lugar la parte afectiva relacional, y el componente psicologico que se enmarca en la situacion. La repercusion mayor se ha visto en la adolescencia, cuya psique esta en desarrollo y el manejo y discernimiento de dicha informacion les es de dificil comprension debido a la doble via de mensajes que entran a su consciencia; planteandoles una compleja eleccion sobre el que hacer frente a las exigencias del medio y lo que en realidad saben o desean. Igualmente influye el contexto cultural y relacional sobre todo en el caso de la familia cuando no hay apertura para poder preguntar sobre estos temas tan importantes debido a que son considerados tabu. Como resultado los adolescentes terminan introduciendose prematuramente al campo de las relaciones sexo-\r\ncoitales cometiendo diferentes errores, arriesgandose a enfermedades y embarazos, y con ello exponiendose a secuelas psicologicas.",

An onslaught of biological, social, and psychological stresses force acknowledgement of previously denied needs for succor, plunging them into battle with their wife-surrogate mother. The resulting counterphobic, hypersexual, ofter self-destructive behaviors are usually falsely interpreted as oedipal. Clinical material in this report strongly suggests this distress is not primarily related to genital sexual issues or fears of castration, but more often concerns issues of autonomy and independence which typically involve the mother and which arose in the toddler or anal phase. Supportive evidence for this thesis from cross-cultural observations, child developmental studies, and primatology is presented, and the usefulness of this view in facilitating clinical work with such men is described.",

This includes inappropriate touching (clothed or unclothed), penetration using an object, forcing sexual activity between children, or asking a child to view, to read, or to pose for pornographic materials. l Most children being evaluated for sexual abuse will not have significant physical findings on examination. However, a thorough physical and genital exam is necessary. A practitioner with expertise and specialized skills should do these examinations with children and adolescents. Many parents and caregivers do not realize that the pediatric genital exam is very different from that performed on adults.

      "abstract": "The transition from childhood to adulthood is marked by dramatic physical, mental, sexual, psychological and social developmental changes. These tumultuous years can have long term consequences for the individual, especially when it comes to mental health. Body shaming, weight shaming or appearance-based harassment can be described as the act of mocking or humiliating someone based on their physical appearance. It often leads to low self-esteem, low body dissatisfaction, and depressive symptoms, which is consistent with the growing body of work emphasizing the harmful role of appearance-based harassment among youth. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of body shaming among school-going adolescents and to assess the distribution and relationship of body shaming with various factors.",

      "abstract": "Sexual behaviors in children are common, occurring in 42 to 73 percent of children by the time they reach 13 years of age. Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

The role of disrespect, a factor that might serve as an abrasive in marriage, was investigated. Couples above average on disrespect spent more time apart on days when there had been a big fight, considerable annoyance, or anger; couples below average on disrespect spent more time together on days when there had been a big fight, considerable annoyance, or anger. This finding suggests that therapy for couples with a presenting problem of insufficient contact may first have to deal with abrasive factors.",

In many cases sexual communication is improved because of contraception; in many cases it has a negative influence, caused mainly by the mental immaturity of the partners, by their emotional instability, or by their sociocultural background. Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

      "abstract": "As many as one third of all women have experienced sexual victimization as juveniles, and a range of emotional, inter-personal, and sexual problems appear to be frequent among these victims. On the current evidence, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these problems are a direct result of the exploitive sexual encounter or of other circumstances in the victims' lives. Nor can the incidence rates for various problems among victimized and non-victimized women be stated with any certainty, the samples on which estimates are made being biased and limited in many ways. Emotionally, the problems of guilt, low self-esteem, and depression, are extremely common among victims, especially those who seek treatment. The interpersonal relationships of many victims are characterized by feelings of isolation, alienation, and difference from other people, together with much mistrust and insecurity. There is some conflict of evidence over the prevalence of hostile or fearful attitudes towards men. Some victims do appear to avoid a lasting relationship with a man and many engage in a series of more transient and casual relationships. Prostitution also seems to be associated with sexual victimization in childhood. Among victims there appear to be tendencies to oversexualize all relationships with men, to engage repeatedly in ill-matched and punitive partnerships, and to exhibit a fear of intimacy. The evidence is contradictory on the incidence of homosexuality among women victims. Sexual problems, and more particularly sexual dysfunctions, appear to be more frequent among victimized compared to non-victimized women, The dysfunctions exhibited include lack of motivation, sexual phobias, vaginismus, impaired arousal, difficulty in reaching climax, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. There is wide variation in adjustment between women victims, and among the factors that may contribute to these individual differences are the age of the child victim, the duration of the victimization, the nature of the sexual activity involve, and the perception of the woman concerning her feelings at the time of the victimization and its effects on her.",

Between the ages of 18 and 24, 179 women had regularly experienced orgasm, but 37 had not. At the age of 25-60, 186 women had experienced orgasm, and 27 had not. We used the method of sampling experiences. The women noted the signs consistent with their usual experiences during “normal” intercourse. It has been established that the appearance of an orgasm before 25 years of age strengthens and reinforces psychological satisfaction, inner comfort, meeting expectations, sexual interest, intensity of reaction and acceptance of what is happening, weakens dysphoria and shame. At the age of over 25 years, appearance of an orgasm maximally stimulates sexual interest, intensity of response, acceptance of what is happening, sharpness of perception, reduces shame and weakens physical discomfort more strongly. The absence of an orgasm before the age of 25 does not have a bright negative effect. After 25 years, this, first of all, leads to a decrease in sexual interest and mood, increased shame, guilt, hopelessness, and disruption of interpersonal interaction.",

      "title": "Family factors associated with conduct disorders in Children and Adolescents.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Conduct disorder is a disorder initially diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and\r\nrefers to a persistent pattern of antisocial behavior in which the individual repeatedly\r\nbreaks social rules and carries out aggressive acts that upset other people. Antisocial\r\nbehavior is a common problem in the course of development of children. Although\r\nconduct disorder has been widely studied, it still consumes much of the resources of\r\nmental health, juvenile justice and the special education system. DSM-IV mentions\r\nconduct disorder as one of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in outpatient and\r\ninpatient mental health facilities for children 1 DSM- IV specifies for conduct disorder,\r\ncriteria which includes symptoms from the following areas: aggression against people\r\nor animals, property destruction, lying or theft and serious rule violation. It defines\r\nconduct disorder as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic\r\nrights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated 2. About a\r\nthird of those affected have antisocial personality disorder in adult life and a further\r\nthird experience other personality, psychiatric and psychosocial problems. The\r\nprevalence of conduct disorders varies from 6-20% in studies across different cultures\r\nand settings 3, 4. In the evolution of conduct disorders different risk factors are\r\nimplicated which includes “child biological factors,” “child functional factors,” and\r\n“psychosocial factors” 5. Even though the number of studies discussing the evolution of\r\nconduct disorders and factors associated with it are numerous, there is a lack of\r\ninformation on risk factors associated with conduct disorder in our Indian population.\r\nIn this study we aim to delineate the family factors like parenting style, parental\r\nseparation, parental psychopathology, family type and family functioning associated\r\nwith conduct disorders.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES : \r\nTo study the family factors associated with conduct disorder in a clinic-based\r\npopulation.\r\nTo study the family factors in children and adolescents diagnosed with conduct\r\ndisorder, in comparison with a group of children without conduct disorder, but with\r\nother psychiatric disorders.\r\nThe following null hypothesis was postulated:\r\nThere is no significant difference between children and adolescents with conduct\r\ndisorder and those without conduct disorder, with respect to family factors.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS : The participants were recruited from the outpatient department of the Child and\r\nAdolescent Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Christian Medical College. This\r\nis a tertiary care centre, providing services to children and adolescents with various\r\nmental health needs, from different parts of the country and neighboring regions. The\r\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry unit of the Department has two divisions, one for\r\nchildren with emotional as well as behavioral disorders and the other one for children\r\nwith developmental disorders. The multidisciplinary treating team makes the clinical\r\ndiagnosis based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic system.\r\n Inclusion criteria:\r\n1. Children and adolescents between 5 - 18yrs.\r\n2. Diagnosed to have conduct disorder based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic criteria\r\nat initial presentation.\r\n3. Conduct disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders\r\n4. Conversant in English, Tamil or Hindi.\r\n\r\nRESULTS : The acceptability of the study data for a parametric analysis was initially assessed and\r\nfound to be favourable as depicted in Table 1.\r\n164 children and adolescents were enrolled for the study between January 2010 and\r\nOctober 2010. As diagnostic data was missing for 5 participants, only 159 participants\r\nwere considered for further analysis. Table 2 shows the participant characteristics of the total sample. The sample consisted\r\nof children and adolescents between the ages of 5 to 18 years with a mean age of 11.61\r\nyears (SD 3.5). Approximately three fourth of the participants were male (74.2%). The\r\nmajority had completed at least a primary or high school education (91.2%).\r\nParticipants were predominantly Hindus and hailed from a upper middle socioeconomic\r\nbackground. There was a slightly larger representation from urban areas (56.6%). The\r\nmajority was from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal (79.3 %), therefore spoke Tamil and\r\nBengali respectively. All the participants included whose mother tongue was Bengali,\r\nwere also conversant in Hindi.\r\nThere were 63 participants with conduct disorder which accounted for 30.6% of the\r\ntotal disorders seen. Among children with conduct disorder, 33.3% had conduct\r\ndisorder in the family context, 15.9% had socialized conduct disorder and oppositional\r\ndefiant disorder was seen in 50.85%.The majority (40%) of other diagnosis present in\r\nthe total sample included mild mental retardation and ADHD. ‘Other’ disorders\r\nincluded nonspecific behaviour problems and enuresis.\r\nCONCLUSION : In conclusion, while this study failed to find a significant association of family factors\r\nwith conduct disorder when a multivariate analysis was done, male gender and more\r\nnumber of comorbidities had a significant association with conduct disorder.",

It may result from organic or psychological causes and can be classified as orgasmic, anorgasmic, and situational. Situational anejaculation may be present in intercourse type. This means existence of ejaculation by masturbation, but not during sexual intercourse. Performance anxiety, hostility toward the partner, dysfunctional psychosexual development, and unconscious desire to avoid pregnancy are the possible underlying conditions. We herein report situational anejaculation in 24-, 26-, 34-year-old males who presented with inability to ejaculate intra-vaginally since they got married. All of them were the sole males in their family, had a childhood in a conservative community, and had arranged marriages. Due to the negative aspects of psychosexual counselling in rural societies, it was not possible to continue the follow-up and treatment of patients. Despite this, the authors conclude that this clinical course of situational intercourse anejaculation suggests a psychological problem in these patients.",

Also sexual abuse in children is defined as engaging a child in sexual acts that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the taboos of our society. Sexual abuse may involve direct acts perpetrated against children as well as other non-touching abuses, which include exhibitionism, voyeurism, or the use of children for pornographic purposes.Although precise incidence and prevalence rate data are lacking, sexual abuse of children is common in our country and throughout the world. Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that has frequently passed unrecognized and its victims (both children and perpetrators) untreated. Child sexual abuse results in significant social damage. The physical and psychological consequences of child sexual abuse may result in trauma and has implications throughout the lifespan. Experiencing sexual abuse as a child also has the consequence of contributing to an increased risk of violent victimization, perpetration, self-directed violence and suicide later in life.Despite the importance of the issues, information about sexual abuse in children and amongst adults has not been commonly shared by health professionals. The purpose of this review article is to assist the physician in their investigation of child sexual abuse by exploring the important topics.",

      "abstract": "La sexualidad es parte integral del ser humano y forma parte de sus varias actividades de vida. Debido a la limitacion consecuente de la lesion, el portador de lesion medular enfrenta cambios significativos en su vida sexual. Ese estudio objetiva describir las alteraciones evidenciadas y las dificultades enfrentadas por el lesionado medular en la relacion sexual. Participaron de la investigacion diez personas portadoras de paraplejia y tetraplejia hay por lo menos seis meses, de ambos sexos. Para colecta de los datos, realizamos una entrevista estructurada. Los hallazgos apuntan que las alteraciones causadas en la funcion sexual dependen del nivel y del grado de la lesion medular. Fueron observadas alteraciones en la sensibilidad, reduccion en la misma; en la ereccion, dificultad en hacerla o mantenerla; en la evaluacion, que puede estar impedida o hacerse retrograda; en la fertilizacion, reduccion del numero de espermas; en la lubricacion, que puede estar disminuida; entre otros. La movilidad alterada es uno de los factores que mas perjudica el portador de lesion medular en el desempeno del acto sexual. Se concluye que la satisfaccion de los antojos sexuales es un factor que proporciona estado de bienestar, con eso es importante que la pareja recoja descubrir diferentes formas de satisfacer esos antojos. La implicacion y la comprension del companero son extremadamente importantes en todo el transcurrir de la conquista de la satisfaccion sexual.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a stage of physiological and psychological human development that occurs during the period of puberty to adulthood. It begins with onset of puberty from 11 or 12 years and ends with the assumption of adult responsibility at age 22. Pubertal period is characterized with accelerated growth in height and weight, secretion of hormones responsible for physiological activities of the cell in the body. Appearance of secondary sexual characteristics like menarche the first menstrual cycle, dispensation of semen or nocturnal emission by boys, Central to adolescent’s sexuality is the attainment of interrelated biological processes that change the immature child into a sexual matured person. Unless adequate information about the body especially in the reproductive area is made available, teenage pregnancies will be on the increase and epidemic of unmarried mothers will continue to grow. This period calls for the need for parents and teachers to effectively communicate with young people openly and regularly to make them stand up for their values and be in better control of their lives and health.

      "abstract": "Age is the predominant risk factor for developing prostate cancer, leading to its description as an \"older man's disease.\" Changed sexual embodiment is a concern for men who develop prostate cancer, often compounding experiences of age-related sexual decline. Although research has examined heterosexual men's experiences of aging in the context of sexual embodiment after prostate cancer, gay and bisexual men have received little attention. This qualitative study used a material-discursive analysis, drawing on positioning theory and intersectionality, to explore constructions of aging following prostate cancer in 46 gay or bisexual men. Thematic decomposition of one-to-one interviews identified three subject positions: \"mastering youth,\" involving maintaining an active sex life through biomedical interventions, accessing commercial sex venues, or having sex with younger men; \"the lonely old recluse,\" involving self-positioning as prematurely aged and withdrawal from a gay sexual scene; and \"accepting embodied aging,\" involving the incorporation of changed sexual function into intimate relationships and finding pleasure through nonsexual activities. These subject positions are conceptualized as the product of intersecting masculine and gay identities, interpreted in relation to broader cultural discourses of \"new aging\" and \"sexual health,\" in which sexual activity is conceptualized as a lifelong goal.",

      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

Some cultures implicitly support a man's right to have affairs, or even several wives, while others have a moral stance against infidelity. Severe marital strain may precipitate extra-marital liaisons or affairs. Frequent travel, overwork, sexual difficulty, or accumulating chronic anger all pose different risk factors from those stemming from individual developmental vulnerability. A man or woman using the internet for sexual interest may be spending time on internet sites and finding heterosexual or homosexual internet partners for emotional exchange and/or for internet sex. For one couple, having a normal but oedipally sexualised child will feel like an attack on the same-sex parent, while for another couple the developmental sexualisation of a teenager threatens. Long-standing sexual difficulty or inactivity pose risks. These surface factors then trigger unconscious issues.",

      "abstract": "In this paper are determined basic concepts of abuse. Abuse of children is defined on different manners in literature but the author gives essential elements for legal determination of this concept. Act of violence exists when a parent, using a physical power on a position of supremacy tyrannies a child endangering its life, health, physical or emotional development. Physical abuse of a child can be determined from several aspects: medical, legal, social and cultural. The phenomenon of abuse was first observed by medical doctor and described as 'the battered child syndrome'. Although, it seams easy to define the physical abuse, there are many various definitions. In this paper, physical abuse of a child in the family means physical acting of the parents or guardians, by which on purpose, by the use of physical force, with or without the use of other means, are caused or could be caused physical injuries or death of a child. Emotional abuse is defined as parent's or guardian's acting or non acting, such as rejection, insult, isolation, terror, verbal attack etc. that might cause serious and permanent disorders in child's emotional development. Sexual abuse is defined as the use of a child to satisfy the sexual needs of one or more adult persons who have authority over a child and in whom the child trusts. The sexual abuse survivors have lifelong psychological problems.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality with a disabling disease, or serious disabling or disability: a sensitive subject probably due to the association of the two words: sexuality and disability. The question of the emotional life, the life of a couple, the sexuality of a person living with a disability remains a real social and cultural problem. This necessarily impacts on the people concerned because they are victims of their states of disability. This is a subject that is difficult to address both by the couple, by society and by health professionals. In addition, it should be noted that regardless of their physical or psychological state, their visible or invisible disability, their chronic, serious, rare, disabling or disabling illness, or simply their difference, everyone has their own sexual identity. The feeling of love, the affective life, the sexual life of a person with a disability, their life as a couple, pleasure, do not disappear with the onset of illness or disability, it is accessible to all, disabled, sick, in a couple or single, married or not, all have the right to sexuality, to an emotional life regardless of their physical appearance, their mental handicap or other differences... However, for many people in a situation of disability, living one's sexuality remains a difficult aspect in their life as a couple, or not, or in their daily lives. Disability, whatever its origin, can contribute to the alteration or changes in the sexual life of a lambda individual, thus affecting his sexuality, his sexual pleasure... Health professionals are often confronted with suffering, physical and/or psychological pain. However, even today the question of the fulfillment and sexual serenity of people with disabilities remains a silent subject, an unresolved issue, not popularized, not a priority if I can put it that way, but the question of pleasure sex is often overlooked. It would seem that social representations approach the subject of the affective relationship and the love life of sick or disabled people, their life as a couple, their intimacy as a couple, their affective and love life, as being abnormality in the face of what they consider \"normal\".",

However, in considering child abuse and neglect as examples of adverse life events that have the potential to affect development and subsequent psychopathology, the assumption of “well-being” in the child’s life prior to the victimization experience may not be a reasonable one. Although certain forms of childhood victimization may indeed be viewed as acute stressors, child abuse and neglect often occur against a background of more chronic adversity in multiproblem homes. Child abuse or neglect may be only one of a family’s problems. Thus the general effects of other family characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment, parental alcoholism or drug problems, or other inadequate social and family functioning, must be recognized and disentangled from the specific effects of childhood abuse or neglect.",

      "abstract": "Trachten we de gegevens van resultaten van de hoofdstukken III t/m VI met elkaar in verband te brengen, dan zien we het volgende:\r\nSubstraatstimuli in het gebied, waarin vrouwtjes voorkomen wekken balts en zoekgedrag bij het mannetje op. Ontmoet het mannetje sexe-genoten in dit milieu, dan reageert het agressief en raakt nu en dan in gevecht met de andere mannetjes. Hierbij heeft het grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde mannetje de grootste kans als overwinnaar uit het duel tevoorschijn te komen, Zijn gedrag verschilt dan duidelijk van dat van de verliezer. Zolang het mannetje niet heeft gecopuleerd blijft de kans, dat het wint van een bepaalde rivaal, die eveneens niet heeft gecopuleerd, betrekkelijk constant. Als het mannetje verliest bij het eerste treffen sluit dit nog niet uit, dat het van het andere mannetje kan winnen. Het zoekgedrag, dat na agressieve contacten wordt gemodificeerd tot marionettengang brengt het mannetje in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van vrouwtjes. Zoekgedrag wordt dan beeindigd en visuele prikkels (misschien ook olfactorische) richten het baltsgedrag op het vrouwtje.\r\nHet vrouwtje is waarschijnlijk bij de eerste ontmoeting nog niet tot paren bereid; de agonistische contacten tussen mannetjes duren dan voort. De grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren hebben daarbij de meeste kans de directe omgeving van het vrouwtje bezet te houden. Bepaalde factoren uit bet baltsgedrag waarschijnlijk vooral het ritme van bewegingen en vibraties immobiliseren het vrouwtje tenslotte, ten gevolge van aanraken door het mannetje of op grond van visuele prikkels treedt kanteling van het abdomen op. \r\nDan kruipt het mannetje op vormprikkels, afkomstig van het vrouwtje spelen hierbij een rol en de copulatie vindt plaats. Vrouwtjes, welke niet worden bevrucht, kunnen na drie maanden nog op de hierboven beschreven wijze tot paren bewogen worden. Bij bet mannetje daalt na een periode van sexuele activiteit de agressiviteit ten opzichte van andere mannetjes. Komt het in dit stadium tot een agonistisch contact tussen dit mannetje en een ander, dat nog geen periode van sexuele activiteit heeft doorgemaakt, dan treedt het laatste mannetje als winnaar op.\r\nVeldwaarnemingen zullen het hierboven getekende beeld nog moeten bevestigen. Net name de regels, welke voor het agonistische gedrag beschreven zijn kunnen met elkaar een belangrijk selectie-mechanisme vormen, waarbij selectie plaats vindt in de richting van sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren en misschien in de richting van grotere dieren. Het is van belang te weten, of dit mechanisme in de natuur inderdaad werkzaam is, of dat misschien het potentiele effect ervan door andere factoren in de leefwijze en het gedrag van Pardosa amentata wordt geneutraliseerd.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of voluntary induced abortion among fathers drafted into military service].",
      "abstract": "This work examines the symptomatology of 4 young men recently drafted into military service in France who had negative reactions to their partner's abortions. The men ranged in age from 19-21 years. In all cases there was frank depression, accompanied or not by activity illegal in the eyes of the military (unauthorized leave) or of the common law (theft, use of drugs). The abortion was either a pretext for a rapid decompensation of a pathological personality, or it occasioned a crisis in personalities previously relatively well adapted despite immaturity, psychopathology, or weakness. The organization of the couples tended to be recent, unstable, precarious, and without a promising future either affectively or socioeconomically. Either the woman decided to seek an abortion herself and presented the father with an accomplished fact, or the couple tacitly made a joint decision to seek an abortion, in which case the subsequent illegal activity of the father tended to be more serious. Each of the men had conflictive family relationships with their fathers especially perceived as hostile and rejecting. All of the men had attempted suicide or had considered it. Induction into the army has traditionally been seen as a rite of passage to adult life, but in some cases the emotional distances it causes and the socioeconomic difficulties it aggravates prevent the man from undertaking the responsibilities of fatherhood. In these cases it is as if social maturity can be acquired only at the expense of fatherhood; the 2 states cannot coexist. Frustration and sacrifice of fatherhood nevertheless may occasion loss of the social maturity stemming from military service. The abortion is followed by guilt, psychic suffering, and behavioral problems leading to expulsion from the military. On the symbolic level the man does not become either man or father. Another point is that depression, anxiety, and guilt are an affective expression of the idea of death; the embryo is thought of as an infant when in fact it is only potentially an infant. On the unconscious level the father may identify with the aborted fetus in the belief that his own parents may have wanted to destroy him. The abortion may also contain a suicidal element to the extent that the fetus represents a prolongation of the parent. The anxiety and guilt of the father find expression also in auto- and heteroaggressive acts. Through a mechanism of projection, responsibility of the army is substituted for that of the individual.",

During puberty, which starts the process of adolescence, adolescents are faced with the fact they have not chosen their body which sends them back to the experience of passivity of childhood. It arouses in the most vulnerable adolescents what remains of expectations or affective dependence regarding their family circle, and thus they are confronted with that basic human paradox, i.e. to be oneself one has to accept to receive and to feed upon others and at the same time to be different from them. Such a fear of being dependent on others may lead adolescents to deprive themselves of what they expect to receive from others. Sexuality and the body, through the emotions they summon, are particularly subject to aggressive or rejection behaviours which characterize that age.",

Past sexual abuse is often discovered in adolescents and adults consulting for mood or sexual identity disorders and addictive behaviors. These patients did not receive any psychological treatment because their parents quickly “forgot” the event. Thus, recovery is impossible: judicial redress has not been started and there is no family recognition of the harm and trauma. The reactions of parents can promote or block the “healing” process, and unsupported children can feel resentment towards their parents. The request for clarification is left hanging and will influence the psychological makeup of the future adult and the quality of their relationship with their parents. Parental silence is generally underpinned by sociocultural considerations, such as the judgment of others, resignation, or divine will.",

      "abstract": "Human sexuality is a lifelong process with biologic, psychosocial, and moral consequences. During adolescence, coping with sexual feelings and controlling sexual drive become urgent tasks that are made more difficult by today's society. Recent studies document a dramatic increase in the frequency of sexual activity among teenagers as well as a decrease in the age at which sexual activity begins. The pregnancy rate has increased dramatically in this age-group because of the general lack of willpower and moral strength of young people; lack of adult role models; sexual exploitation of the young, particularly by mass media and industries; and aversion of teenagers to contraception. Births to teenagers have actually decreased slightly, however, because of the accessibility of abortion.",

Sexual dysfunction comes at significant psychological and physical health cost. The frequency and enjoyment of sexual intercourse is strongly associated with longevity with the findings of the Caerphilly study showing a 50% mortality risk reduction in those men with high orgasmic frequency. The importance of taking a sexual history is partly in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction which is rated as high as 31% of men and 43% in women. Sexual symptoms are often indicators of underlying endocrinological, neurological, psychological and cardiovascular disease and can be related to side effects of medication or following surgical treatment. Organic issues may be more likely if the issue is: present in older patients, gradually appeared, tends to occur in all situations; is persistent/progressive; accompanied by risk factors for the organic concern; if accompanied by partnership or anxiety, they are often secondary reaction.",

      "title": "Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Workplace bullying and harassment is prevalent in contemporary workplaces with detrimental negative outcomes for targets as well as for bystanders and the organization itself. At any one time, some 3%–20% of the working population is targeted, suffering reduced motivation and productivity, severe mental and physical health problems, and a risk of exclusion from the organization and even working life altogether. Bullying and harassment is about the systematic and ongoing mistreatment of an employee by other organization members, mostly of a psychological and social nature and often involving a gradually escalating process that may end in severe victimization of those targeted if not properly managed and handled in its early phases. In early phases, by some denoted incivility, the behaviors involved are often subtle, indirect, and discrete, while in later phases they become ever more prevalent and direct—even involving threats and open verbal abuse. Bullying may involve work-related behaviors creating a difficult and even dangerous working situation for the target, personally demeaning behavior, acts of social exclusion and non-inclusion, and physically intimidation behaviors. Hence, bullying comes in many shades and forms, as well as at many levels of intensity. Although risk factors and antecedents of this complex problem may be found on many levels, factors in the immediate working environment and the design and management of work are particularly important. Furthermore, bullying is particularly prevalent in working environments characterized by a hostile working climate and in organizations where such behaviors are permitted or even rewarded.",

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Sexual abuse is defined as use of child or adolescent by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse can be in the form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10-40%. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5-15% of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical assault, developmental phase, child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during neuron plasticity phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response. Early life stresses are shown to lead changes in corticotrophin releasing factor system in preclinical and clinical phase studies. In the treatment of sexual abuse, emotional process related with trauma should be focused on. This process may be conducted with play therapy. Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed. For the elimination of guiltiness related with stigmatization, the child should be told that it is not herhis fault to incorporate into sexual interaction and the culprit is abuser. It is fairly important for medical staff, school and family to have sufficient information about sexual abuse for prevention and early recognition.",

      "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults may be more vulnerable to elder abuse (EA) due to prior marginalization and trauma, lifelong discrimination, and health disparities. While characteristics of both victims and perpetrators can modify the risk for EA, few studies have focused on perpetrators. This study examined the number and type of perpetrator-victim relationships and perpetrator profiles for EA experienced in the prior year, by abuse type and sexual orientation and gender identity of the abused. Data are from community-dwelling Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging participants aged 65 or older at follow-up 1 (n = 23,466). Heterosexual men and women reported being abused psychologically and physically most often by spouses or partners. Gay and bisexual (GB) men reported being abused psychologically most often by non-family, non-friend “others”. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women reported psychological and financial abuse most often by siblings or other family members, and physical abuse by non-family, non-friend “others”. Heterosexual women were abused financially most often by their children, and both heterosexual and GB men reported more financial abuse by “others” or friends. Overall, 15% and 5% of participants reported abuse by multiple perpetrators of psychological and financial abuse respectively. LB women experienced more EA overall (18.8%), by multiple perpetrators (31% for psychological abuse, 66.5% for financial abuse) including by their siblings and other family members. These results have important implications for mitigation and preventive measures. They also highlight the need for further research concerning sexual minorities experiencing multiple abuse types and/or abuse by multiple perpetrators.",

Physical, social/emotional, and relationship factors were all found to have a significant impact on the prevalence of one or more sexual problems. In addition, we observed an important gender difference: increasing age was more consistently associated with sexual problems among men. Thus, sexual problems among women and men appear to share similar correlates, but physical factors may play a larger role among men. However, as men age, there may be more psychological and relationship issues as well that influence their sexual satisfaction and performance.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKey words: Psychological erectile dysfunction, psychological impotence, erectile dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour : older people’s repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

Whilst some youngsters misleadingly look as if they are 17 and sexually mature, others can almost literally be half their size and still be very much children in all respects. Physically mature 12-year-old girls may have to cope with confusing sexual feelings and experiences for which they privately feel emotionally unready, despite their apparent outward sophistication. Small 14-year-old boys who are late developers suffer agonies wondering if their bodies will ever change into those of men. The sense of being unable to control the body's physical destiny can bring enormous anxiety, frustration, anger, and distress, as acne takes a hold or breasts become too obvious a feature on a shy girl's body. This is the age of puberty, which can be protracted or rapid, during which young adolescents reach sexual maturity.",

To address this topic, we conducted a secondary data analysis of 57 human sexuality students’ narratives regarding the emotional and situational contexts of the first sexual image they recalled. We examined those narratives where participants reported that they saw was a “real person” either nude or engaged in sexual behavior. These participants reported viewing three kinds of sexual behavior or nudity: parental, other family members, and nonfamily. In examining participants’ immediate reactions and long-term reflections, we found that many participants, especially females, were confused or upset by what they saw, but few reported a lingering discomfort. Our results indicate that children would benefit from immediate, nurturant, and clarifying parental responses, particularly when children walk in on parents having sex.",

      "title": "Seasonal variation in primate fertility with an emphasis on the male",
      "abstract": "Seasonality of births occurs in a variety of animals including nonhuman primates and humans. Seasonal reproduction in humans is dampened by comparison with many animal species, and the factors controlling seasonality are more complex. It has proven difficult to unravel the multiplicity of variables controlling seasonal reproduction in humans. In this review, the seasonal variation in human reproduction is compared with that which occurs in freeranging troops of nonhuman primates in an effort to gain insight into the human phenomenon. This comparison shows that in both nonhuman primates and in humans, photoperiod is an important impeller of seasonal reproduction. Also, seasonal reproduction in nonhuman primates and humans is driven by a complex interaction between the animal and the social environment. This paper focuses on environmental impellers of seasonal reproduction in the male. Free-ranging male macaques exposed to a natural environment show a waxing and waning of sexual behavior, testosterone production, and spermatogenesis with a peak during mating season and a nadir during the birth season. Male macaques deprived of social cues from sexually receptive and/or attractive females undergo an incomplete or retarded sexual recrudescence when compared to male macaques exposed to a physical and social environment that initiates mating activity in a breeding group of male and female macaques. These latter results suggest that recrudescence of reproduction in male nonhuman primates during the mating season is dependent on cues from both the social and the physical environment. These results from nonhuman primates, together with results of the review of seasonal variation in human reproduction, suggest that the human female might play a key role in seasonality of births. Therefore, it is suggested that future research designed to unravel factors controlling seasonal patterns of human reproduction focus on factors regulating male-female interaction, female sexual behavior, and female fecundity.",

      "abstract": "Paraphilia is a term used to describe different sexual deviations involving unconventional methods of sexual gratification. Paraphili as indulged in abnormal and orthodox sex play by using objects as parts of the body or fantasies in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. Perversions are acts that are socially prohibited or unacceptable, or biologically undesirable. In sexual paraphilia, usually, person psychopaths suffer from mental aberrations and conflicts, socio-sexual maladjustments, psychosexual imbalance, and abnormalities. Paraphilia-induced suicide is a type of anomic suicide, and anomic suicide is due to a lack of social regulation that occurs during high levels of stress and frustration. Paraphilia may induce suicide even though paraphilia is not punishable. It is just due to fear of social defamation and social taboo. Case presentation: A 59-year-old male committed suicide on the railway track, and thenthe body was sent to the mortuary room for an autopsy examination. History was taken from the police and relatives. He was a widower for the last 15 years. Conclusions: Paraphilia is the form of the insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and when a person cannot remove foreign bodies himself, attending a hospital is very humiliating. To prevent the social integrity or selfesteem, the person committed suicide. Where this type of paraphilia is not listed as a crime in India, for sexual gratification, a person may use it by any means, which may be natural or unnatural form. Many unnatural forms of paraphilia are used by many people, which is not punishable. Sexual gratification is done by most of normal people and a few abnormal psychiatric people by any sexual perversion. All paraphilia that is not punishable by the law should not be considered a social taboo.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pubertal maturation is a time of dramatic physical, reproductive, and psychological changes, including the development of secondary sex characteristics and changes in body composition. It requires a complex series of hormonal changes initiated by alterations in hypothalamic regulatory mechanisms that are incompletely understood, culminating in gonadal sex steroid secretion and associated maturation. While genetics play a major role in the timing and progression of pubertal maturation, other inputs such as nutrition, environmental factors, and social milieu yield individualized variations in the maturational pattern. It is likely that these factors are in part responsible for changes in timing and tempo of pubertal maturation noted over the last few decades. When a child begins to mature at the earliest or latest extremes of the normal ranges, the clinician must determine if the child is undergoing normal puberty, a non-pathologic variation, or a medically concerning condition that requires further investigation or treatment.",

El maltrato, en sus multiples versiones, tiene consecuencias negativas en el desarrollo emocional o psicologico; dana la autoestima, genera sentimientos de inferioridad e inadecuacion y confusion en el mundo afectivo; interfiere en el desarrollo adecuado de la personalidad; genera dificultades en el aprendizaje y conductas perturbadas de inhibicion, timidez, agresion y violencia, algunos tipos de maltrato producen traumatismos y lesiones que inhabilitan fisicamente o intelectualmente, o pueden llevar a la muerte. Todo maltrato fisico, emocional o psicologico, sexual o por abandono, siempre atenta contra el desarrollo sano del nino; por tanto, su efecto puede ser devastador en su vida y en su personalidad. 1 Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses. Manual de procedimientos para la realizacion del dictamen medico legal en maltrato infantil. Santa fe de Bogota., 1998 p. 49. El articulo 44 de la Constitucion Politica de Colombia consagra como derechos de los ninos y las ninas la vida, la integridad, la salud, y la seguridad social, la alimentacion equilibrada, su nombre y nacionalidad, tener una familia y no ser separados de ella, el cuidado y amor, la educacion y la cultura, la recreacion y la libre expresion de su opinion.

Los derechos de los ninos/as prevalecen sobre los derechos de los demas. Con esto se recogen los principios Plasmados en la Convencion Internacional de los Derechos del Nino (CIDN) aprobada en la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas y adoptada el 20 de noviembre de 1989, los compromisos internacionales derivados de la misma (pacto mundial, pactos regionales, programas de accion a favor de la infancia, pactos por la infancia), los desarrollos posteriores, convenios sobre explotacion sexual, secuestro, trabajo infantil y vinculacion de los ninos y las ninas a las fuerzas militares, entre otros.

It is worth noting that such phases, while they may be appropriate for considering sexual development, are not the best way of looking at ego and superego development, nor at the development of relationships with others—matters dealt with later in the lectures. Any prohibition given to the child during the time of infantile sexuality can remain as an inhibition or develop into an inhibition, and can hold up adult sexuality; this does not mean that freedom given to infantile sexuality guarantees normality in the adult—far from it. There was no way of understanding from the theory of sex life, as it existed then, where all the many abnormalities of sex life come from. Even in those times, children before the age of adolescence or preadolescence were known to show sexual reactions and to have genital interests.",

As\r\nsexual harassment violates an individual's fundamental rights, the perpetrator may\r\nbe subject to criminal prosecution besides a range of disciplinary measures, up to and\r\nincluding dismissal from employment.

If the unfavourable treatment was due to the\r\nemployee's refusal to accede to the sexual demands, it may well fall within the scope\r\nof the gender discrimination.

      "title": "Preliminary Results in a Romanian Population Screening of Erectile Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Abstract The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating sexual disorders in general and erectile dysfunction in particular tend to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life of all individuals and couples affected. The objective of this study was to identify the main characteristics and correlates of erectile dysfunction which are key elements in improving the diagnosis procedure, comorbidities prevention and the implementation of efficient treatment protocols, the aims of our main research project. Preliminary data of an erectile dysfunction screening in a Romanian population are discussed. Keywords: sexual disorders, erectile dysfunction, screening INTRODUCTION Sexual activity is very important for most individuals, regardless of age, sex or sexual orientation. However, throughout our lifespan, different changes at the physical or psychological level may influence, among others, our sex life. Moreover, most women and men occasionally experience sexual difficulties. If these sexual difficulties prevent the individual or couple from enjoying sexual activity during any phase of the sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and if they cause distress and interpersonal problems, sexual disorders are very likely to be present. Since people tend to avoid talking about their sexual problems, many people develop various myths about what is and what is not normal when it comes to sex life. Society, media or religion tend to shape unrealistic or dysfunctional images of sexual behavior. The lack of acknowledgement of certain disorders and over diagnosing others are, to a certain extent, common phenomena. Sexual disorders can also be often mistaken for various symptoms of several other mental disorders (such as affective and anxiety disorders) as they appear together quite frequently. The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating these disorders tends to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life. Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as (male) impotence, is one of the most frequent sexual disorders; ED is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient to permit a satisfactory sexual intercourse (Coman, 2004). Although ED is referred to as a benign pathology, it has a significant negative effect on the patients, their couple lives and their socioprofessional performances. The incidence and prevalence of ED have grown remarkably lately, not only because of the population aging effect and of the increasingly higher action of risk factors on the general population, but also because of the beginning of use, at the end of the last millennium, of oral medication against this pathology, medication that had the role to raise awareness of the masculine population regarding this pathology. The socio-cultural prejudice and the perception that ED is part of the aging process have led to a poor addressing of elderly men to doctors [contrary to the general perception, Helgason (1996) indicates that 13% of the patients aged 50 to 80 consider sexual activity to be very important, 29% see it as important, 41% consider occasional sexual acts to be pleasant and only 17% consider sex not to be important]. Most patients turn to medical assistance only in severe cases of the pathology, when the diagnosis and the treatment are more complex and costly. On a global level, the prevalence of ED is over 500 million men; estimative data (Ayac et al., 1999) predict a doubling of the prevalence of ED in 2025, this problem becoming thereby a serious public health issue. Among the Eastern European countries, Romania has the highest prevalence of ED, 25% in the general population, which means that one out of four men experience such difficulties. According to the CLOSER study (Porav-Hodade, et al., 2007) ED is even more frequent in older men; more than half of men over 50 years of age have different levels of ED. …",

Effects of sexual music videos on viewers' gender schemasResearch suggests that music videos with sexual content have an effect on viewers' attitudes towards gender roles, including gender roles in the context of a sexual relationship [11,7,5].These findings are explained by two theories of cognition, namely, the Social Learning Theory and the Priming Theory.The Social Learning Theory claims that individuals learn from modeled behaviors [12].In this view, the repetition of stereotyped depictions of men and women in the media help shape children's gender schemas, leading children to perceive masculinity and femininity in more traditional and rigid ways [13].Priming may also play a role in how viewers perceive the sexual content of a music video.According to Priming Theory, different stimuli activate different schemas, or blueprints of a construct, which can influence cognition or behavior [14].If audiences consider music videos to be a heavily sexualized media overall, or a particular artist to have a hypersexual persona, they may view individual videos with sex-related schemas already Identifying sexual content in music videosResearch has shown that music video imagery has often been",

      "title": "아동학대의 사전방지정책으로서 부모의 License화론",
      "abstract": "Our society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal to perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do so. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people from practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have satisfied certain licensing requirements. These general criteria for regulatory licensing can certainly be applied to parents. First, parenting is an activity potentially very harmful to children. The potential for harm is apparent: each year more than half a million children are physically abused or neglected by their parents. Many millions more are psychologically abused or neglected not given love, respect, or a sense of self-worth. The results of this maltreatment are obvious. Abused children bear the physical and psychological scars of maltreatment throughout their lives. Far too often they turn to crime. They are far more likely than others to abuse their own children. Even if these maltreated children never harm anyone, they will probably never be well-adjusted, happy adults. Therefore, parenting clearly satisfies the first criterion of activities subject to regulation. This discussion is abhorrent and needs to be supplanted with a more child-centered view. Parents who hold this view may well maltreat their children. If these parents happen to treat their children well, it is only because they want to, not because they think their children deserve or have a right to good treatment. Moreover, this belief is manifestly at odds with the conviction that parents should prepare children for life as adults. Children subject to parents who perceive children in this way are likely to be adequately prepared for adulthood. Hence, to prepare children for life as adults and to protect them from maltreatment, this attitude toward children must be dislodged. As I have argued, licensing is a viable way to protect children. Furthermore, it would increase the likelihood that more children will be adequately prepared for life as adults than is now true.",

      "title": "Aberrant Sexual Behavior, Violence, and Reproduction",
      "abstract": "The hypothesis is advanced that sexual arousal and orgasm can result, in certain situations, from mental or physical violence or stress to oneself or to others. This sexual arousal is based in an organism's biological imperative to reproduce when under stress. Parallels with lower forms of life—cells, plants, and animals—are presented as demonstrating a unity of evolutionary purpose. Autoerotic asphyxia is looked at as a learned technique of enhancing sexual pleasure through hypoxia to the brain. Anaerobic exercise and the accompanying hypoxia is also presented as capable of inducing sexual arousal. Violence is examined as a sexual stimulus, especially as it occurs in sadomasochistic practices, rape, child molesting, and serial killings. All of these aberrant sexual behaviors are seen as stresses which can produce sexual arousal.",

Purely mechanical disorders of seminal deposition due to anatomy are to be differentiated from functional libido and orgasmic disorders, from ejaculation problems or the inability to achieve or maintain erections. While pure orgasmic disturbances are almost in all cases due to psychological or psychiatric causes, libido and erectile dysfunction may also have hormonal causes and thus be symptoms of androgen deficiency. Additional clinical symptoms of hypogonadism or objectifiable findings such as testicular atrophy, changes in secondary sexual characteristics, or ejaculate volume allow the organic genesis to be identified in pronounced cases, while in other cases the corresponding indications must be actively sought. Thus, while functional orgasmic and libido disorders are the domain of psychological psychiatric or endocrinological therapeutic approaches, this chapter deals primarily with disorders of seminal deposition and functionally or organically caused disorders of cohabitation.",

On learning of their infertility patients usually go through an initial emotional crisis. The male response thereafter varies depending on the aetiology of the infertility. Male factor infertility threatens the traditional male/father role and results in a feeling of personal and sexual inadequacy. This may resolve itself in extramarital affairs or by the sufferer throwing himself into his work. Unfortunately treatment for infertility often has transient negative effects on male sexuality, and is frequently believed by the recipient to be more successful than in fact it is.",

Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence against women are major public health problems and violations of human rights. They result in serious short- and long-term physical, sexual and reproductive, and mental health problems, including increased vulnerability to HIV. Near about 15-71% of women experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives. Violence against women (VAW) affects all phases of lifecycle of a women, as rightly pointed out by WHO, starting from sex selective abortion in prebirth period; female infanticide, female genital mutilation, child marriage or prostitution in childhood; physical, sexual, psychological abuse, rape, sexual harassment, dowry murders, forced pregnancy in adolescence and adulthood period; ending in physical and psychological abuse in elderly.",

Disturbances of her reproductive function can upset her sense of well-being, her feelings about her sexuality, her femininity, and her self-esteem. Symptoms may affect her intimate relationships and bring greater distress than symptoms in other systems. Women presenting with gynecological problems often appear tense and anxious just because of the nature of the intimate questions and examination which they anticipate with some apprehension. Some come distressed and tearful. They may feel shame and disgust about their symptoms or because of the reaction of others. Many find the whole consultation an ordeal. The examination can remind a woman of previous threatening situations such as rape or childhood sexual abuse, or past experience of painful or demeaning examinations by previous clinicians.",

      "abstract": "This thinkpiece arises from personal reflection on researching ‘sexualisation’, on the individuals and issues encountered and on elements that were unspoken or more rarely voiced. It suggests that the discourse on sexualisation tends to construct an ‘other’ from which speakers distance themselves, variously defined as ‘bad’ mothers, sexualized girls, ‘unhealthy’ sexuality, undesirable or wrong values, an exploitative industry, and so on. The grip that ‘sexualisation’ has on the public imagination may be due less to the social problems it identifies, and more to how it serves as a repository of disavowed or unacknowledged parts of our (social) selves. Ethically and politically, the paper suggests, we should pay more attention to the relations between self and ‘other’ constituted in and through the debate about sexualisation.",

      "title": "Adolescent Difficulties in Achieving Separateness",
      "abstract": "Many adolescent difficulties relate to the problem of not being able to tolerate the 'gap' between self and other, upon which subjectivity is founded. We have seen in Chapter 6 that one particular aspect of expressing difficulty with and defending against the pains of separateness and intimacy is to engage in behaviours and take up positions that appear more adult or at least show intolerance of the pains of dependency. On the other hand, it is possible to identify adolescents that appear to locate the problematic arena in the outside world of peers and adulthood. These adolescents appear to be stuck on the inside, within the child in the family role. This has the meaning that the impact of internal, familial and social factors, often in inextricable combinations, slows down or brings to a halt the adolescent development towards separateness and relative independence of parental figures. Thus, either physically or emotionally or both the adolescent is unable to become a 'temporary outsider'. There is a range of adolescent difficulties that can be associated with being stuck on the inside. In order to explore the psychosocial aspects of these difficulties in adolescence, this chapter will discuss adolescents with phobias, body image disturbance and eating disorders and disabilities. This is followed by a discussion of depression and self-harm.",

      "abstract": "Human asexuality has been defined as a lack of sexual attraction to others, although its nature is not well understood. Asexual men's genital and subjective sexual arousal patterns were compared to sexual men's to better understand asexual men's sexual response patterns. Using a penile plethysmograph to measure genital arousal, 20 asexual, 27 heterosexual, and 22 gay cisgender men (M age = 28.28, SD = 9.41) viewed erotic films depicting sexual activity or masturbation, and a subsample engaged in sexual fantasy of their choosing. Questionnaires assessing sexual function and behavior were also completed. Asexual men scored lower on sexual desire and orgasmic function, higher on sexual aversion, and did not differ on overall sexual satisfaction. Compared with gay and heterosexual men, asexual men demonstrated lower genital and subjective sexual arousal to the erotic films but displayed similar sexual arousal when engaging in sexual fantasy. Asexual men's lower levels of sexual excitation rather than their higher levels of sexual inhibition were associated with lower responses to the erotic films. These findings suggest asexual men have preferred sexual stimuli that differ from sexual men and have a similar capacity for sexual arousal as sexual men. Collectively these findings add to a growing literature aiming to understand the nature of asexuality.",

The children had an average, or above-average IQ and none of them had any experience of sexual abuse. It was found that young children have a very limited knowledge of sexuality. They only possess some basic knowledge of genital differences, gender identity, sexual body parts and (non-sexual) functions of the genitals. Knowledge of pregnancy and birth, reproduction and adult sexual behaviour was found to be very limited and decreased in the order presented here. Non-sexually abused children appear to interpret situations that show physical intimacy between adults and children in terms of their own experiences. None of the children talked about sexual activities. Older children generally knew more than younger ones. No significant differences in knowledge between boys and girls were found.

      "title": "Physical performance in high school students: effect of chronotype",
      "abstract": "Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) is an individual characteristic, defined as chronotype. People are typically categorized in 3 different chronotypes: Morning, Evening and Neither types (M, E and N-types), which differ in the circadian rhythm of many physiological variables. M-types use to wake up and go to bed early and to have their best performances in the first part of the day, otherwise E-types go to bed and wake up late and they have the peak performances in the evening. The chronotype is influenced by both individual and environmental factors and gradually changes during human development. Many studies have demonstrated a trend beginning with a tendency toward morningness in children that gradually evolves into a shift toward eveningness. Approximately at the age of 20 years, this shift reaches its maximum and starts to decline, leading to a growing tendency toward morningness from midadulthood on. This more pronounced eveningness has been found to negatively affect adolescents’ sleep and daytime functioning; even physical performance of adolescents can vary throughout the day because sleep pressure increases, the input from the circadian timing system is optimal or non-optimal to perform the task or both of them. In this study participated 216 students, 124 males and 92 females, attending the first two high school classes (mean age 14-15 years). For the assessment of chronotype, all students compiled the Morningness-Eveningness Questionaire (MEQ), validated by Horne and Ostberg in 1976. For all subjects we collected anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI). All the subjects were categorized as M (n=22), N (n=165), and E-types (n=29). To assess the relationship between chronotype and physical performance, from the sample we recruited 51 subjects, 22 M-type (14 males and 8 females) and 29 E-types (18 males and 11 females), who carried out three Eurofit tests (SHR, Shuttle Run; SBJ, Standing Broad Jump; Cooper endurance test). Preliminary results, although showing some differences in physical performance between E and M chronotype, have not detected statistically significant differences between the two groups.",

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour: older people's repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Although sexual abuse of children has likely been present for ages, its recognition in the United States and other countries has dramatically increased in the past 5 years. Reported cases, which represent an unknown fraction of actual cases, now account for approximately 25% of all abuse and neglect reports. Local, county, and state agencies are staggering under the load, and many are relying heavily on pediatricians to assist them in their work. DEFINITION Sexual abuse can be defined as the engaging of a child in sexual activites that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the social taboos of society. This definition is broad and includes intrafamilial and extrafamilial forms and all types of sexual activities (eg, exhibitionism, fondling, child pornography, oral, anal, and genital sexual contact). The interface between \"normal sexual exploratory behavior\" and \"sexual abuse\" is not clearly defined. Pediatricians should, however, use common sense. If two 4-year-old children are found to be playing without clothes, touching each others' genitals and giggling, there is probably little to worry about. The same is true if two 15-year-old adolescents are discovered together. A probably exists if the 15-year-old child (some states set statutory 2- to 4-year limits within which sexual activities are not to be considered abuse) or if one 4-year-old child is engaging in fellatio or attempting intercourse with another preschool-aged child.",

Il loro bisogno di nascondersi viene rinforzato dall’umiliazione pubblica traumatizzante che fa seguito sia all’espressione aperta del loro desiderio omosessuale, che dei loro comportamenti non conformi alle aspettative di genere. L’esperienza di essere scoperti, puniti e umiliati per aver mostrato o per aver agito tali sentimenti o comportamenti puo portare allo sviluppo di attivita finalizzate al nascondimento, che persistono a lungo anche dopo che il trauma reale e stato dimenticato. Quando le espressioni aperte di intimita nei confronti di una persona dello stesso sesso vengono tenute cosi nascoste, le attivita sessuali clandestine e proibite, pesantemente tinte da uno stato di angoscia interpersonale, possono divenire una modalita relazionale significativa per la persona. Questo articolo offre un punto di vista psicoanalitico clinico per il lavoro con gli uomini gay che tiene distinto il concetto di compulsione sessuale da quello di identita sessuale. La concettualizzazione di Harry Stack Sullivan sulle difese dissociative puo essere utile per la comprensione clinica e l’elaborazione terapeutica con le persone gay in generale, e con gli uomini gay sessualmente compulsivi in particolare. Un tale approccio consente alle identita sessuali degli uomini gay di essere rispettate pur al contempo potendosi rivolgere verso i loro comportamenti compulsivi che molti di loro trovano cosi disturbanti.",

The elderly lose much with aging: decline in their senses, health, mobility, and independence.

However, for both incarcerated men and women, anticipated resident parent role inoccupancy upon release (or expectations not to live with their minor children) is generically associated with current subjective mental health problems net of distress prior to lockup. Role inoccupancy strains are further associated with subjective physical health problems among women but not men, indicating more pervasive associations among the former.",

In intact males, emission is possible without genital stimulation, and the occurrence of emission is not automatically associated with orgasm in men or with the normal behavior sequelae to ejaculation produced in animals by copulation. These and other similarities between sexual reflexes in primates, carnivores, and rodents are taken to indicate the potential values of a broadly comparative approach to human sexual functions.",

El objetivo es describir los enfoques actuales de la sexualidad en los adultos mayores de 65 anos de edad. Se han desarrollado gran variedad de mitos y/o tabues, el primero se refiere a que los adultos mayores no tienen capacidad fisiologica que les permita tener conductas sexuales activas, no les interesa el sexo, las adultas mayores que se interesan por el sexo son perversas y ridiculas (Viuda alegre), el adulto mayor con deseo sexual es un degenerado o viejo verde, las personas mayores no son sexualmente deseables, la disfuncion erectil es normal en los adultos mayores, entre muchos mas. Se concluye que la sexualidad en los adultos mayores es la expresion psicologica de emociones y compromisos que requiere la mayor cantidad y calidad de comunicacion entre ellos, en una relacion de confianza, amor, compartir y placer, con o sin coito. Los principales cambios anatomofisiologicos que se producen en los organos sexuales de los adultos mayores tienen que ver de una forma directa con el desarrollo de su sexualidad. La existencia de estresores como puedan ser la perdida de la pareja, el deterioro de la red social y del nivel socioeconomico o la presencia de problemas de salud en la familia, contribuyen tambien a la aparicion de diversas dificultades en la actividad e interes sexual en el anciano. La renuncia a la actividad sexual debe ser el ultimo recurso y debe quedar como opcion del individuo, nunca como consecuencia fatalista de un evento en particular.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction has become the catch-all for infidelity, cheating, promiscuity, and rape. Recently it has become the newest claim for rapists and child molesters. Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

The main cause of vaginismus is not known, but is often considered multifactorial. This paper aims to describe the factors that contribute to vaginismus. Case: A 26 years old, married woman, health practitioner presented with the complaint of not being able to have sexual intercourse. About 1 month ago, since marriage, the patient was unable to have sexual intercourse with her husband. The patient feels guilty and anxious because of the inability to please her husband. The patient's father was very dominant and was a \"religious\" type of parent who always gave advice with religious aspects regarding all matters. The patient's mother was a nervous person and always said that what the father said was a law that had to be obeyed. Likewise, talk about sex is a taboo topic of discussion and is considered embarrassing. Discussion: Many factors need to be explored related vaginismus. In the case, the biological aspect can be ruled out because the patient has consulted with the ob-gyn doctor. from the psychological aspect; perceptions, attitudes and attitudes towards sex and the values ​​held by parents contribute to vaginismus in this patient. Conclusion: a therapeutic approach which focuses on all aspects promises quite good therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study compared the family characteristics, victimization histories, and number of perpetration offenses of juvenile offenders who admitted to having had sex with animals to juvenile offenders who did not. The study found that 96% of the juveniles who had engaged in sex with nonhuman animals also admitted to sex offenses against humans and reported more offenses against humans than other sex offenders their same age and race. Those juveniles who had engaged in sex with animals were similar to other sex offenders in that they also came from families with less affirming and more incendiary communication, lower attachment, less adaptability, and less positive environments. Those juveniles who had engaged in sex with animals reported victimization histories with more emotional abuse and neglect and a higher number of victimization events than other offenders. This would seem to indicate that sex with animals may be an important indicator of potential or co-occurring sex offenses against humans and may be a sign of severe family dysfunction and abuse that should be addressed in the arenas of psychological intervention, juvenile justice programs, and public policy.",

Some men of an advanced age, feeling that their sexual ability is at stake, can be even more exposed to the compulsive risk of regressing to phallic defences by entrusting their own identity and self-esteem to their possibility of performing the sexual act. Mature genital organisation—that is, full recognition of oneself and of the other in his or her entirety—is an ideal for men as it is for women. Perhaps for a woman the problem, although equally as crucial, can be less obvious since she can easily dissimulate to herself and to her partner because she does not have to \"show\" or \"demonstrate\" anything at the concrete level about her ability to enjoy or give pleasure.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Coming to terms with one’s sexuality can be a lengthy process. Coming out in this context refers to the process of accepting same-sex attraction and informing others of one’s sexual identity. Coming out is different for each individual, with some men come out later in life after years of denying their sexuality. There are issues specific to this population. These include overcoming internalised prejudice resulting from prolonged exposure to homophobia, disclosing same-sex attraction to their opposite-sex partners and children, as well as re-establishing the self as a gay or bisexual man to their social and professional network. To date, there are limited services available for men who come out later in life. As a result, many of these men feel isolated, especially from the mainstream youth-centric gay culture. Internalised prejudice can also prevent them from befriending other gay men, seeking support and education. All of these can have a detrimental effect on their well being. <h3>Methods</h3> Momentum is a peer-based workshop for same-sex attracted men aged 27 years and above. The workshop provides support and education relating to sexuality and sexual health. Feedback from Momentum participants for the period of February 2014 to April 2015 are collected and analysed. <h3>Results</h3> Participants expressed heightened knowledge of their sexuality after attending the workshop. The workshop also provided them with an educational environment relating to sexual health. Additionally, many stated the social benefit of the workshop, as they formed friendships that expand their social support network. Many participants felt supported and connected to the gay community, indicating positive benefits gained from attending the workshop. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The needs of gay men who came out later in life must be recognised to assist them overcoming homophobia, construct a supportive social network, and provide sexual health education relevant to their lived experiences to improve their well being. <h3>Disclosure of interest statement</h3> The Victorian AIDS Council is funded by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. No pharmaceutical grants were received in the delivery of the program.",

Sexual activity of older people society usually describe using pejorative terms as an inappropriate, bizarre or obscene, but these labels are different than reality. Hormonal changes and other physiological changes associated with aging affect sexual interest. Erectile dysfunction is a problem in men increasing with age. There is no evidence that premature ejaculation is more common in older age. Cross-sectional studies showed no difference in sexual dysfunction between older and younger women. Age is not a barrier to sexually transmitted diseases. The most common pathogenetic factors for male erectile dysfunction are vascular diseases.

      "abstract": "Abstract The model of sexuality currently in force is a young, genitalized model, that does not tolerate failures and often forgets about affective communication, sharing and body contact. This model is also not compatible with the natural aging process, generating manymyths about sexuality in later life. Although a taboo subject, the majority (up to 70%) of healthy 70-year-olds revealedthemselves to be sexually active even with some sexual dysfunction reports. Low sexual desire (up to 43%) was the most prevalent reported sexual difficulty in women, and erectiledifficulties (up to 37%) were most prevalent among men. Aging impacts sexuality in various ways: age-related organic/metabolic changes in men and women; age-related affective and cognitive changes also in both genders; age-and duration-related changes in a couple’s dynamic interaction, which can lead to discrepancy between the partners and their sexual narratives. In the sexual response cycle, aging affects the stages of desire, arousal/excitement,plateau, orgasm, and resolution/refractory period both men and women. Depressed mood as well as the use of antidepressant drugs, deterioration of cognitive function and difficulties to communicate can cause loss of intimacy and emotional closeness which then may result in sexual withdrawal and difficulties. Repetitive experiences of failure increase even more the couple distress. There are also to consider medical conditions, medication side effects, loss of physical capacity, subjective loss of attractiveness, lack of a partner, institutionalization or living withtheir children, which can be obstacles to sexual activity in the elderly. Diagnostic workup has to integrate not only general medical, gynecological, urological andpsychiatric factors, but also take a systemic perspective which deals with the interaction pattern of the partners. Treatment of sexual dysfunctions in later life combines biomedical interventions with psychotherapeutic and psychosocial strategies. An essential therapeutic contribution for allcouples is, however, basic counseling and psychoeducation. Explaining how aging has an impact and how other individuals and couples experience these changes is an important step in empowering the couple, clarifying and correcting the sociocultural myths andencouraging the couple to build their very own sexuality.",

      "title": "The Unpopular Victims: Individuals Who Are Sexually Abusive – The Black Swans",
      "abstract": "This article contends that youth who engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or, sexually abusive behaviors are too often viewed primarily through a criminological lens, regardless of their age, gender, judicial status, and/or experiences of past trauma/victimization. Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

Gender incongruence (GI) occurs the gender identity of a person does not align with the gender assigned at birth. If GI causes significant distress or problems in functioning lasting for at least 6 months, it is described as gender dysphoria (GD). This case study contributes to understanding how gender dysphoria may result in personality disorders such as paranoid personality disorder in a conservative society. Removing societal taboos and accepting individuals with their perceived gender can lead to timely diagnosis and management of patients, preventing severe outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Data on hypoactive sexual desire, which occurs in patients with hypogonadism, its classification, anatomical features, and the author’s clinical example of castration-induced hypogonadism are presented. It is reported that if castration is carried out before puberty, then sexual desire does not develop, and if after its completion, only a decrease in its intensity is noted. This is due to the fact that hormonal changes that occur during puberty increase the “sensitivity” of the brain, and therefore the “mental component” of sexual desire develops, which does not disappear after castration. It is noted that the dependence of libido and sexual activity of men on androgens is much less than in animals. Moreover, it is reported that this dependence is much less in people with a higher level of intellectual development. However, castration carried out after puberty and even in mature men with extensive experience in sexual life still leads to a weakening of sexual desire and a deterioration in other sexual functions. If we are talking about the assessment of libido, then during the examination it is necessary to analyze the severity of its various components and, in particular, the safety of its sexual component. It also provides data on the weakening of sexual desire caused by diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diseases of internal organs, tumors, other diseases and conditions, exposure to ionizing radiation. The author’s clinical observations are given, where the weakening of sexual desire in persons exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was preceded by its strengthening. Possible mechanisms for the development of sexual dysfunctions associated with exposure to radiation are reported. Also data on hyposexual sexual desire caused by smoking, alcohol and drugs use are provide.",

Since sexual attraction to both genders was considered normal, the main divisions concerned age, social status, and role: females and smooth males (boys 12–18) were desirable objects, hairy males (men) undesirable; the active partner was penetrative and thus masculine, the passive partner penetrated and thus female or effeminate, so that it was shameful and improper, slavish, and arguably unnatural for free males of any age to play the passive role whether for a price or voluntarily except in certain initiatory or military contexts institutionalized in some communities.

Inappropriate sexual behavior (a common cause of disruption among children who are hospitalized for psychiatric disorders) may be caused either by hypersexuality or by simply ill-regulated behavior: a definition of hypersexuality is proposed that can be applied at the bedside (namely, sexual behaviors or fantasies that have abruptly increased in frequency by comparison with a previous baseline, are of sufficient excessiveness to disrupt expected or usual social, academic, or occupational functioning, or constitute a source of distress), so that this distinction can be made promptly, and we present a differential diagnosis for hypersexuality to direct its evaluation. Virilization does not seem to be a common cause of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, but it should not be overlooked when it does exist.The differential diagnosis of hypersexuality in adults, which we present for comparison, is much larger than it is in children.",

In the elderly there is a progressive decline of organic functions; the decrease of sexual and procreating activity is linked with the impaired male hormonal production. The four stages of sexual function are modified: 1. delayed erection; 2. plateau prolongation; 3. orgasm modifications; 4. fast penis detumescence. In addition to organic impairment, aesthetic, social, environmental and psychological factors can restrict sexual activity, as well as past sexual experiences and co-morbidity. There are specific aspects concerning sexuality in the elderly, such as the increased chances of public relations and emotional involvement, the more intense psychic activity and the stronger process of removal and sublimation of impulses. In conclusion the best way to deal with sexuality in the elderly is the multidimensional assessment.",

It is suggested that sexual confabulations are generated within incestuous family structures as a means to stimulate and satisfy needs of personal closeness when losses and disruptive events have occurred.

Child Sexual abuse will result continuously terrible impacts, not only on its victims’ health problems but also on their psychological condition, such as permanent trauma, even after they have been grown up.

This conviction is held and persists despite the painfully obvious fact of normal male anatomy and genitalia, before and after puberty, and in the absence of delusional ideation or psychosis in the majority of transsexuals studied. He is disgusted with the development of his primary and secondary sexual characteristics, to the point where the male transsexual frequently contemplates and occasionally performs self-mutilation of his genitalia. He prefers normal, heterosexual men as sexual partners, and rejects homosexual men or the idea that his sexual activity is homosexual. Feeling he belongs to the female gender, he considers it appropriate to have a love relationship with a man, and he feels “unnatural” in a relationship with a woman, considering this “homosexual.” There is some evidence that sex or overt sexual activity, whether it be considered homosexual or heterosexual, plays a minor or secondary role. The transsexual may decide to pass and become accepted as a female, either before or after sex reassignment surgery, depending upon individual circumstances. The postoperative results of 121 male transsexuals who have obtained sex reassignment surgery are reviewed. A satisfactory outcome, as indicated by improved social and emotional adjustment, is 10 times more likely than an unsatisfacory result. Improvement is enhanced if the transsexual has functional use of an artificial vagina, obtains a legal change of gender status and freely passes in society as a member of the opposite sex. At the present time one is impressed with the lack of success in attempting to alter gender identity, once established, by traditional psychotherapy. This fact, together with the apparent success of sex reassignment surgery, compels one to accept the surgical treatment of transsexualism on an experimental basis until the initial results can be verified or contradicted or until alternative treatment procedures prove successful.",

      "title": "Consequences of lonely experience in adolescents",
      "abstract": "The article explores the consequences of experiencing loneliness in adolescents, highlighting the negative impact on mental, physical and social health. Because adolescents feel the need to communicate and receive affection, aspiring to be understood and to have an interlocutor with whom to be honest. This stage of life often comes with emotional intensity, a state of euphoria, periods of sadness and, sometimes, a distancing from family, especially in situations of misunderstanding on the part of adults. The main danger at this stage refers to an excessive concern for oneself or the escape from interactions with others. The inability to form trusting relationships with others generates a feeling of loneliness. Relevant studies on the causes and factors that can lead to social isolation, as well as its effects on adolescents, emphasize the complexity and ambiguity of this phenomenon. The lack of a clear picture of how adolescents experience loneliness suggests that this phenomenon can take various forms. These forms can be manifested in different contexts of social isolation, either by choosing to isolate themselves or being forced to withdraw, and can influence both personal development and a wide range of causes, manifestations and effects on the existence of adolescents. When these needs are not met, there is a risk of developing emotional and social loneliness, the absence of connections with loved ones, and the search for belonging to informal groups. The article also analyzes theoretical perspectives on the fundamental needs of adolescents and how the lack of emotional connections affects personal development. Loneliness is associated with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, poor academic performance and risk behaviors, such as substance use or suicide attempts. Social isolation also influences physical health by increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders. The article emphasizes the importance of multidimensional interventions for the prevention and management of this phenomenon, recommending emotional support, social activities and the development of communication skills.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological adaptation underlies all human behavior. Thus, sexual coercion by men could either arise from a rape-specific psychological adaptation or it could be a side-effect of a more general psychological adaptation not directly related to rape. Determining the specific environmental cues that men's brains have been designed by selection to process may help us decide which these rival explanations is correct. We examine six testable predictions against existing data: (1) Both coercive and noncoercive will be associated with high levels of sexual arousal and performance in men. (2) Achieving physical control of a sexually unwilling woman will be sexually arousing to men. (3) Young men will be more sexually coercive than older men. (4) Men of low socioeconomic status will likewise be more sexually coercive. (5) A man's motivation to use sexual coercion will be influenced by its effects on social image. (6) Even in long-term relationships men will be motivated to use coercion when their mates show a lack of interest in resistance to sex because these are interpreted as signs of sexual infidelity. Current data support all six predictions and are hence consistent with the rape-specific hypothesis, but this does not eliminate the side-effect hypothesis, which is likewise compatible with the findings, as well as with the further evidence that forced matings increased the fitness of ancestral males during human evolution. We suggest some research that may help decide between the two hypotheses.",

Both within the family and in society at large, the child has been thought culpable of dishonesty and worthy of blame in the situations where disclosure has been attempted. Symptoms experienced by adults who were victims of childhood sexual abuse are those of a chronic or delayed post-traumatic stress disorder, as described by C. Courtois. It is vitally important that victims who disclose the abuse are met with acceptance, belief and hope for healing from their physicians.

      "abstract": "F or the chronic pain sufferer, sexual expression may become distorted, inhibited, sublimated, alienated, demanding or fearful-patterns frequently seen in people who view sexual activity as a duty or a means of procreation. The idea that sexual activity will cause, precipitate, or aggravate the pain may yield reluctance to participate, thus further anxiety and depression, which can diminish sexual function. Yet the human need and desire for sexual warmth is not negated by pain. Sexuality does not stop when pain strikes, it merely changes. Some form of sexual expression is possible for, and the right of any, regardless of disability, according to Weinberg(1). Although illnesses and surgical procedures may produce sexual difficulties, none have more devastating effects than diseases of the neuromuscular system(2). Any impairment of parasympathetic nerve activity, or loss of muscular and/or skeletal movement-such as with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis-can involve sexual dysfunction. The most difficult position for people with restrictive movement is the one most frequently used for intercourse. Although the male-on-top position allows good vocal and visual communication, a female with arthritis may be unable to abduct and rotate her hips for the supine position(3). Alternative sidelying and rear-entry positions may be less strenuous and may ease the partner's fear of causing pain. Major tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, and narcotics are a major part of some pain treatments but a diminished libido and potency are common side effects. Patients need to be informed about these effects and should be helped in timing their doses.

It was hypothesized that these emotional problems may be mirrored by physical intimacy problems such that child molesters would show exaggerated disgust reactions to the thought of coming into physical contact with adults, but not children. It was demonstrated that the discomfort shown by both offenders and non-offenders at the prospect of coming into contact with the bodily fluids of another person increases in relation to the age of the person that the bodily fluid came from. Furthermore, child molesters, in comparison to non-offenders and violent offenders, showed excessive concern at the thought of being touched on the lips or tongue with a re-sterilized surgical swab. These exaggerated anxieties combined withthe implicit belief that children are less contaminating than adults could add to the drive for child molesters to seek physical intimacy with children.",

It may contribute to marital difficulties or cause sexual problems, including promiscuity, and the repeated conception of out-of-wedlock children. For a small number of women (and perhaps men), the need or wish to be held is a major determinant of a particular characterological pattern or way of life. It is surprising, therefore, that the seeking of body contact has received so little attention in the psychiatric literature. Comprehensive investigations have been conducted only on subhuman species. Some observations on human infants and adults have been reported but mostly as incidental findings, and they are not derived from systematic studies. While the dearth of investigations of the need or wish to be held or cuddled can be attributed to various influences,",

A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

      "abstract": "Using the eye gaze of others to direct one's own attention develops during the first year of life and is thought to be an important skill for learning and social communication. However, it is currently unclear whether infants differentially attend to and encode objects cued by the eye gaze of individuals within familiar groups (e.g., own race, more familiar sex) relative to unfamiliar groups (e.g., other race, less familiar sex). During gaze cueing, but prior to the presentation of objects, 10-month-olds looked longer to the eyes of own-race faces relative to 5-month-olds and relative to the eyes of other-race faces. After gaze cueing, two objects were presented alongside the face and at both ages, infants looked longer to the uncued objects for faces from the more familiar-sex and longer to cued objects for the less familiar-sex faces. Finally, during the test phase, both 5- and 10-month-old infants looked longer to uncued objects relative to cued objects but only when the objects were cued by an own-race and familiar-sex individual. Results demonstrate that infants use face eye gaze differently when the cue comes from someone within a highly experienced group.",

Genital surgery performed on unconsenting minors (including both circumcision and sex-reassignment surgery) has been claimed by its adherents to cause few adverse psychological effects. However, mounting evidence now reveals that such genital cutting causes harm physically, sexually, and often psychologically. For example, among 313 men circumcised as infants, 75% reported psychological harm, 60% reported resentment, 54% reported anger, 50% felt violated, 47% felt inferior to intact males, and 43% believed that circumcision impeded sexual relations. Individuals circumcised as children or subjected to sex-change operations have often described their experiences in the language of violation, torture, mutilation, and sexual assault. In view of the possible long-term adverse effects on mental health caused by unnecessary genital surgery on infants and children, it is time to cease all forms of such non-therapeutic genital cutting.",

Research now demonstrates that typically such abuse goes on for decades, is frequently multi-generational and almost inevitably the father (or step-father) is part of some sort of organized abuse network. Victims of such abuse experience extreme fear and shame, are highly dissociative, highly conditioned, and in keeping with an enduring extreme attachment to their primary abuser typically feel fused with their father and indeed do not experience themselves as owning their own body. Invariably the father and other abusers are represented in their psyche in the form of dissociative identity states. This chapter highlights the enduring attachment to the father, the early manipulation of sexual responses and the ways in which a child abused from a very early age remains very controlled by the father with ongoing polymorphous extreme (usually sadistic) sexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "The central premise is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In those ways, they are like more ordinary sexual preferences, generating sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals are strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them are unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet, since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct to not trust the individuals with such preferences and to attempt to monitor or control them. However, most such efforts appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

These risks remain true regardless if the victim is directly or indirectly targeted (as a witness) during the violent episodes. However, these risks are also modulated and moderated by a series of variables, such as the parental emotional and social support, the family’s structural integrity and cohesion and victim’s age and sex.",

      "abstract": "The persistent or recurrent difficulties of the woman to allow vaginal entry of a penis, a finger, and/or any object, despite the woman's expressed wish to do so\" is vaginismus. Early traumatic sexual experiences (e.g. sexual abuse), religious orthodoxy, low self-esteem and body image, negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of knowledge about sex and fear responses are some of the traditional etiological correlates of vaginismus. Vaginismus is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. An interview is crucial in differentiating the causes of this disease and it should involve the following key questions: -whether the contraction of the vaginal muscles was recorded from the first sexual contact and still remains a need for sexual satisfaction is achieved without relations vaginal or -symptom occurs for some time and what circumstances it bound or -contraction of the muscles is independent of the will, reflex and is at the very idea of sexual intercourse, and -that the contraction of the vaginal muscles occurs when you try to enter the member into the vagina which is very painful. The physical, gynecological and sexuological examinations exclude local causes of the disease. The mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases is psychosexual support. The cause of organic vaginismus is congenital malformation of the genital tract. It results from abnormal development of genital paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, which are structures involved in the process of oviduct, uterus, and vagina organogenesis. This has strong implications in the practices of gynecology and sexuology in general, not only in adolescent gynecology and sexuology. Vaginismus with congenital malformation is an important problem in these fields.",

In some cases elder abuse causes permanent injury and even death. Elder abuse, especially abuse perpetuated by family members, dates back to ancient times. Recognition of elder abuse as a social problem and one type of family violence came after that of child and domestic abuse. Elder abuse was initially called “granny battering” and attracted the attention of medical personnel and later that of legal and academic personnel as well as the general public. Elder abuse continues to impact the lives of older adults, especially women, 60 years and older in several ways. It is a worldwide problem that impacts the quality of life of elders in several ways. Research and policy literature tend to classify elder abuse into seven main types: physical abuse, sexual abuse or abusive sexual contact, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, self‐neglect, abandonment, and financial abuse or exploitation. Though several incidence and prevalence studies have been conducted, the need for more intervention studies is recognized.",

      "abstract": "We can identify five important needs that children have: the need for acknowledgment, acceptance, awareness or attention, respect, and care. If these needs are not met, children will modify themselves by denying central parts of their nature in order to adjust to their parents and the situation at large. When a child denies his or her talents, powers, and gender or aspects thereof, he or she loses quality of life, the ability to function, and physical or mental health. The loss of ability takes the form of diminished social ability, psychosexual potency, joy, energy, and fantasy while playing, as well as diminished ability to concentrate, focus, and learn. Many modifications result in a child with severely damaged self-confidence, self-worth, and poor performance. A child more or less deprived of self-worth cannot enjoy, give, or receive. A child deprived of emotions turns cold, rational, asocial, socially stiff, uncomfortable, and in the extreme case ... intentionally “evil”. When a child denies his or her own sex, it becomes invisible, uninteresting, and vague or becomes like the opposite sex in behavior and appearance. The general holistic solution to the vast diversity of symptoms in children with low quality of life is to improve the situation for the child and give the child the holding and support he or she needs. It is very important to realize that a negative belief often has survival value to the child as it helps the child to avoid taking responsibility for problems, which really belong to the parents or other adults. Children have a fine capability for spontaneous healing, and seem to enter this process more easily than adults, given sufficient holding. The symptoms of children with poor thriving ability are often difficult to understand, as they are caused by a complex combination of self-modification in five existential dimensions. This often leads to complex medical diagnosis, giving the idea that the child is sick and without therapeutic reach, while sufficient holding could solve the problem. If holding and support of the child is not enough, the situation must be carefully analyzed to find other possible causes of poor quality of life, health, and functional ability. Education of the parent in holding is often mandatory. Most children with bad thriving ability can thus be helped by simple means.",

      "title": "Emotional Neglect and it's Impact Upon the Self",
      "abstract": "Emotional neglect is one of the five sub-types of childhood mistreatment that has been classified by practitioners in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and education. The other four are sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and physical neglect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the least studied area from these five despite being commonly cited by research as being the most likely to occur. Contrary to what one might guess, numerous studies have in fact reported that emotional neglect can have an even greater negative impact upon individuals than the other types of mistreatment, particularly in regards to how individuals view themselves and their place in the world. Emotional neglect can broadly be defined as repeated and consistent caregiver-child interactions that are characterized by emotional unavailability, withdrawal, lack of reciprocity, disinterest or disengagement which lead to the child feeling that s/he is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs. Previous research has published findings strongly associating childhood emotional neglect with a range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, low self-compassion, shame, guilt, sexually risky behavior, self-destructive behavior, negative schemas, poor emotional regulation, Machiavellianism and so on. Given what we know in relation to the sheer importance of the interactions between primary caregivers and the child, namely by way of Bowlby's attachment theory, it is unsurprising to find that emotional neglect has many detrimental consequences. The reasons for emotional neglect can be numerous. One of the more common reasons behind it include it being passed on from generation to generation (as is also often the case with other types of abuse/neglect); indeed, social learning theory would support the idea that we take a lot of our parenting skills and styles directly from our own parents, even if we perceive them to be negative. Another source may be familial adversity, such as poverty, living within a conflict, or living during a time of persecution. Emotional neglect may also ensue due to the sickness of a sibling or parent, as the physically sick family member often can receive all attention and emotional capital of the family unit. Parental drug or alcohol abuse would place a child at risk of experiencing emotional neglect as would the seemingly more benign yet often just as threatening driven parental styles within which all love is contingent upon meeting pre-set academic or, later in life, professional goals. In the context of Qatar, it is also worth noting that emotional neglect often occurs within family units within which material wealth is abundant, however there is physical or psychological distance between the child and the primary caregiver, say due to a large number of siblings, half-siblings or maid/nursing staff being employed to take on child-rearing duties. Our emotional development, and being raised within a context in which we feel loved and cared for, is vital to the healthy development of the self. Accordingly, I have been looking at how emotional neglect impacts upon the self, that part of us that is believed to be the source of our consciousness and the core of our being. Two specific aspects of the self which I intend to include in my research are self-esteem and memory recall. Both of these areas have not been looked at in the context of emotional neglect research yet both may hold valuable findings that will then allow practitioners to be able to design interventions that will aide individuals in overcoming their emotional neglect. This will also be the first reported study that has used qualitative interviews to assess the impact of emotional neglect. This was also a key for me; through all the research I had reviewed, the emotion in emotional neglect was not being conveyed in the numbers and the statistics. Being a student of science though I know the value of these constructs and it was with both of these ideas in mind that I decided to use mixed methods for this doctorate study. This Ph.D. is currently being carried out by me at Queen's University Belfast, and is being supervised by, Dr Teresa Rushe.",

      "abstract": "An examination of cognitive sexual orientation, sexual partner activity, and sexual identity was conducted among 76 lesbian/bisexual female youths and 80 gay/bisexual male youths (age range of 14–21 years) recruited from community‐based or college organizations for lesbian / gay youths in New York City. Self‐identification as lesbian / gay or bisexual changed over time; more than half the youths who identified as lesbian / gay at the interview had considered themselves bisexual in the past, and vice versa. A modal developmental sequence of cognitions and behaviors was found: Most youths first became aware of a cognitive sexual orientation (e.g., attractions and fantasies) toward the same or other sex, then considered a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity, and finally felt certain of a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity. Age at initiation of sexual activity with females or males was inconsistently related to this pattern. Significant gender differences indicated that females were older than males when they first considered (M years of 13.9 and 12.5, respectively) or were certain of (M years of 15.9 and 14.6 years, respectively) being lesbian/gay. The majority of youths had a history of sexual activity with the same sex (88% of females and 95% of males) and the other sex (80% of females and 56% of males). The youths became sexually active during the early adolescent years, both with the same sex and the other sex. Their sexual practices, with the same and other sex, followed an initiation sequence beginning with manual (i.e., hand‐genital) sex during the early teens and ending with anal practices during the middle and late teens. No significant gender differences were found in lifetime prevalence rates or ages at initiating sexual practices with the same sex. Gender differences were found for other‐sex partners: Females became sexually active at an older age than did males, and more females than males engaged in heterosexual activity. No significant differences in the psychosexual variables were found among Black, Hispanic, White, and youths of other ethnic backgrounds.",

Many such women must struggle with other forces such as the devastating effects of terrible emotional/physical neglect or physical and/or sexual abuse, often inflicted within a chaotic chemically dependent family system. Many lesbian and bisexual women with long-term recovery are plagued by such major problems as eating disorders, dissociative disorders, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, compulsive debting/spending, sexual dysfunction, inability to be intimate, relationship problems, internalized homophobia, sexual identity confusion, and self-harming behaviors. A sense of defilement or stigma is unavoidable in the face of societal disgust and hatred both for those who are alcoholic and for those who are lesbian or gay or bisexual.

Doch selbst wenn auf körperlicher Ebene vordergründig keine negativen Auswirkungen der Selbstbefriedigung gesehen werden, sind diese Befürchtungen nicht vollkommen verschwunden. Immer dann, wenn ungewohnte oder unerwartete körperliche Wahrnehmungen auftreten, werden diese sofort mit der Befürchtung in Verbindung gebracht, sie könnten durch Selbstbefriedigung entstanden sein. Wenn während der Pubertät beispielsweise die Haut am Penis oder auf den Hoden dunkler wird oder Talgdrüsenektopien in diesem Bereich auftreten, führen diese völlig normalen Hautveränderungen zur Verunsicherung und zu der Frage, ob es möglicherweise an der Selbstbefriedigung liegen könnte. In gleicher Weise sind oft Mädchen verunsichert, sobald sie bemerken, dass die Schamlippen unterschiedlich groß oder beispielsweise die inneren Schamlippen größer als die äußeren sind.",

By other accounts, these offenders exhibit pedophilic sexual interests. In this study, phallometrically determined sexual interests, recidivism, and choices of victims of 69 sex offenders with mental retardation are examined and compared with those of 69 sex offenders of average or higher IQ. Consistent with hypotheses, sex offenders with mental retardation exhibit more deviant preferences for prepubertal children, male children, and young children than do the comparison offenders. They are also more likely to have had a prepubertal victim, a prepubertal male victim, and a very young victim. They are no more likely than the comparison offenders to exhibit preferences for extremely coercive sex with children or to exhibit deviant adult activity preferences, nor are they more likely to recidivate violently. Results support the idea that pedophilia is a disorder of neurodevelopment and point to the importance of risk assessments that include assessing sexual preferences among sex offenders with mental retardation.",

      "abstract": "We have presented data on 69 female alcoholics who have had three or more interviews. Almost all are of high socioeconomic status. The majority are Protestant and college-educated. They drink at home and do not come to the attention of public agencies. Their childhoods were invariably disturbed, with a dependent relationship toward a cold, dominant parent, usually the mother. Half the fathers were alcoholic. Many patients felt an identification with the father rather than the mother. All patients grew up feeling inadequate and worthless and unable to express their hostility directly. Marital disharmony appeared to be the most frequent factor perpetuating our patient's alcoholism, though many had drunk heavily before marriage. The marriages were troubled by inadequate emotional communication and poor sexual adjustment. Nevertheless, they were remarkably long-lasting and free of infidelity. The husbands were usually overtly domineering but invariably controlling and unable to express feelings. Patients who remained single had retained the ambivalent dependent relationship toward one or both parents. Alcohol, initially the \"enabling drug\" which provided the missing feelings of adequacy and acceptability, became later the releaser of hostility, tool of revenge, and means of self-punishment. All patients exploded their anger when drunk. The following modal pattern appeared in 27 of our cases: cold domineering mother, warmer but alcoholic father, \"miserable self-image,\" cold domineering husband, resort to alcohol patterned after father's drinking. We have speculated on what basic factors may be crucial to the development of alcoholism in an individual woman.",

The widespread belief that the sexual abuse of boys is relatively uncommon means that male survivors will often minimise the effect the sexual abuse which they have suffered has had on them. The cultural and social dynamics that are at work in our society ensure that men develop a rigid and potentially unstable masculine identity that is buttressed at the expense of dehumanizing women, particularly denying and repressing their relationship to their mothers, their most important first attachment relationship. Fantasy can become a focus for the survivor's rage at being helpless and powerless when the abuse took place. Some of the men may not have concerns either around fantasies and/or about acting them out. They may simply internalize their experience and repress or split it off.",

Principle findings are that in spite of severe genito-sexual dysfunctions the majority continued having intercourse and about half felt orgasmic. Sexuality maintained its pre-injury significance for nearly all subjects, and most characterized their sexual lives as at least to some extent satisfactory. Loco-motor impairment and autonomous dysreflexia were more frequently given as causes of reduced sexual pleasure than were sexual dysfunctions. High spinal cord severance and lack of regular partner were negative factors for continuation of satisfying sexual experiences. Thus, genital sexual dysfunction is but one factor determining level of sexual satisfaction after a spinal cord trauma as many younger tetra- and paraplegics appear to be able to identify new and gratifying ways of sexual fulfillment.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical transitional period in every teenager’s life and is marked by a plethora of physiological, physical and psychological changes, as well as a melange of polar emotions. Adolescents tend to seek autonomy from parental figures and want independence in domains of education and decision making. Furthermore, as explained in Erik Erikson’s psychosocial stages in 1968 of development, adolescents search for their personal identity and seek to achieve their sense of the self. This is marked by a phase of exploration – the experimental stage that is called the ‘moratorium’ – which, if marked by successful identity achievement, may lead to the formation of one’s own set of beliefs on what is right and wrong, their own moral system. This success is marked by a formed sense of the self, which allows adolescents to accept individual differences and keep them from conforming to societal pressures. An alternate outcome of this phase is ‘identity crisis’, which causes an adolescent to have an unclear sense of the self and it leads to a prolonged stage of experimentation, in the journey to find oneself. This may be dangerous if it leads to delinquency, substance abuse, eating disorders, etc. The primary aim of this study is to examine the difference in adjustment and happiness between students of middle school (age 12-14 years) and high school (age 15-18 years). The sample size consists of 30 middle school and 30 high school students. Tests employed were ‘Satisfaction With Life Scale’ based on ‘subjective well-being’ by Ed Diener (1984). Following the collection of data, the raw scores were analyzed using Ed Diener’s standardized analysis for SWLS.",

Recently, there has been an increased focus on fatherhood and fathering in academia, policy, practice, and the general media. However, data on men who do not become fathers has been excluded and their experiences minimized and dismissed. Infertility research has shown that failure to achieve the high social status of parenthood has the similar effects on mental and physical health as a diagnosis of life-threatening illness. In this chapter, I will draw on two qualitative research studies to show how not achieving the pronatalist ideal of parenthood impacts on men's identity, sense of self, behaviors, health and well-being and social networks across the life course. The workplace is an arena where people who do not fit socio-cultural norms and expectations are overtly and/or covertly stigmatized and discriminated against through policy, working practices and everyday interaction between groups and individuals. I will argue that failing to acknowledge men's experience of non-reproduction has a significant impact on both individuals and institutions alike.",

      "title": "Brain Development and Sexual Orientation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual orientation (homo- vs. heterosexuality) is one of many sex differences observed in humans. Sex differences can result from differential postnatal experiences (interaction with parents, environment) or from biological factors (hormones and genes) acting pre- or postnatally. The first option is often favored to explain sexual orientation although it is supported by little experimental evidence. In contrast, many sexually differentiated behaviors are organized during early life by an irreversible action of sex steroids. In particular, the preference for a male or female sex partner is largely determined in rodents by embryonic exposure to sex steroids. The early action of these steroids also seems to affect sexual orientation in humans. Indeed, clinical conditions associated with major endocrine changes during embryonic life often result in an increased incidence of homosexuality. Furthermore, multiple sexually differentiated behavioral, physiological, or even morphological traits that are kn...",

      "abstract": "Gender identity disorder of childhood refers to a rather rare disorders, but according to the literature girls with the disorder in the future may become homosexual or transsexual. The necessary diagnostic criterion for gender identity disorder of childhood is the presence of a constant desire to belong (or the conviction of belonging) to the opposite sex, coupled with a strong denial of the behavior, characteristics and/or clothing specific to the registered sex. Usually the disorder is manifested in the preschool years, but for diagnosing it is necessary that it manifests before the onset of puberty. Both sexes may have a rejection of anatomical structures inherent in his own sex; however, such unusual display is rare. Patient V. came to the appointment with psychiatrist with parents 3 years ago. During the interview reported that she starts to feel the boy at the age of 9 years. This announcement provoked outrage from parents. With the beginning of the critical days began to position herself in a male person. The patient met all diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder of childhood. The patient underwent a course of systemic therapy combined with nootropics. Currently, patient name is the name of a female, the patient wears women's clothing, identifies herself as a woman. The patient continues to meet with a psychotherapist, is satisfied with the treatment, thoughts on sex change does not express. Thus, in the case of diagnosis of this disorder can become effective systemic therapy in combination with nootropics.

      "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, the majority of adults over the age of 65 are physically and psychologically healthy. They are not cognitively deficient, socially isolated, or lonely, nor do they drain society's resources. They are aging well, and to the extent that they are able to engage in valued activities, they will continue to do so. A key component of adapting to growing older is the ability to maintain the sense of personal control that can be threatened by normal aging processes. The Activity Restriction Model of Depressed Affect proposes that to age successfully is to maintain physical and cognitive functioning via engagement in personally meaningful activities. Indeed, activity restriction—or the inability to continue normal activities that often follows stressful life events such as debilitating illness—is a major factor in poorer mental health outcomes. Potential contributors to activity restriction and depression are identified. Interventions to reduce activity restriction in older adults should focus on promoting manageable activities, taking into consideration individual differences in functional, psychological, and social resources.",

India is a home to almost 19% of world’s children. More than one third of the country population around 440 million is below 18 years However in India, which has the largest number of child population in the world, nearly 40% of the its population 69% of Indian children are victims of child abuse .According to WHO: ‘’Child abuse or maltreatment Constitutes all forms of physical and/or emo- tional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent Treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child’s health . Child abuse includes, physical violence 75%, sex- ual molestation 20%, mental and emotional 5%, maltreatment with negligence, deprivation and lack of opportunity . A recently conducted survey revealed shocking facts pertaining to child abuse in India. More than 53% su ered with sexual abuse, while 54% with physical and 48% with emotional abuse at the hands of par- ents and family members. Sexual abuse is one of the most devastat- ing type of child maltreatment and estimates that it has increased significantly during past decade. According to a 2007 survey sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development over 53% of the children have been sexually abused . Children between 5 and 12 years old are the most vulnerable age group and boys out number girls with 52.94% reporting abuse. In February 2011, the times of India re- ported that every 2.5 hours a child below 16 years of age and every 13 hours a child below 10 years of age is raped in India making it the country with the highest number of child sexual abuse of any country. The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males according to a 2009 study pub- lished in Clinical Psychology .According to the study done by Chithra M (2011), regarding mothers knowledge regarding child abuse re- vealed that majority of mothers (82%) have inadequate knowledge child abuse. The mother is the primary care giver for the child hence has a major role to play in this arena. This prompted the researcher to undertake this study focusing on mothers. Language: en",

      "abstract": "This paper describes severe, disorders of maternal affection and behaviour and suggests that there is an early process of mother-to-infant bonding which can go seriously wrong.Forty-four self-selected women who had suffered from at least one episode of postnatal mental illness described an unexpected and often catastrophic failure to love one or more of their babies.These women reported absent affection, sometimes hate, rejection, neglect or impulses to harm, in relation to at least one of their children. These feelings often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, and with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the term 'maternal bonding disorder'. Twenty-nine of the women were multiparae; first-borns were not significantly more likely to be the focus for such feelings. There was no direct evidence of predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences. Postnatal mental illness and recalled severe pain during labour were significantly associated with such disorders which, in their severe forms, did not occur in the absence of postnatal mental illness.The nature of the link between postnatal mental illness and disorders of maternal bonding remains unclear. Because, in multiparae, the disorder often 'missed' the first child, factors such as maternal personality traits or early childhood experiences cannot be regarded as sufficient causes.",

      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in the context of sexuality, excludes the mere absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity. Thus a woman’s sexual function encompasses many areas; the construct of a normal function as a quality of life indicator often but not always conforms to the sexual response cycle, which is an endogenous process contributed by hormonal, vascular, neuronal, and psycho-emotional factors. Clinical and scientific evidence abounds about the physiological role of sex steroids viz. oestrogen, testosterone, and also progesterone in facilitating and maintaining the woman’s sexual parameters. The neurophysiology extends from the central and peripheral nervous systems to the targeted genital structures resulting in coordinated vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle relaxation, to be accompanied by pelvic vasocongestion, vaginal lubrication, and labial and clitoral engorgement. Any detrimental impact on this normal cycle of concerted responses can result in a functional impairment or ‘female sexual dysfunction’ (FSD). Sexual changes, psychogenic or organic, are common in women at any age; such complaints are frequently accompanied by quality-of-life concerns, varying levels of personal distress, anxiety, depression, and also fertility concerns in younger women. With FSD as a medically diagnosable entity, fewer drugs have met the safety and efficacy criteria for global approval and clinical utility. In order to appreciate the diverse range of FSD and the extent of its physical, physiological, and psychological implications, it is important to understand the fundamentals as well as the changing paradigms in a woman’s sexual functioning.",

ISD is multicausal and multidimensional and manifests differently for males and females. Precipitating factors include traumatic sexual experiences, negative self-image, sexual guilt or shame, deviant or variant sexual behavior, relationship difficulties, and a chronic sexual dysfunction. Regardless of whether the male or female experiences ISD, the effect on the couple is that the cycle of positive anticipation, pleasure-oriented intercourse, and a regular rhythm of sexual contact is replaced by anticipatory anxiety, unsuccessful intercourse, self-consciousness, and avoidance. This article outlines a therapeutic plan for establishing resilient sexual desire by emphasizing intimacy, pleasure, satisfaction, and realistic sexual expectations.",

As will be discussed, certain lesions are highly specific for sexual abuse while others may be nonspecific or more consistent with a medical disorder or accidental injury. It is important to remember that the vast majority of children disclosing sexual abuse do not have physical evidence of injury or infection on examination. Sexual abuse describes involvement of children and adolescents in developmentally inappropriate sexual activities to which they are unable to consent and which they cannot comprehend. Violent assault causing severe injuries is the exception in child sexual abuse, as sexual abusers often exploit the power differential between victim and perpetrator to manipulate children into complying with sexual activity.",

      "abstract": "The attachment of the infant to the mother can be seen in open parkland when an infant is set free for exercise and play. In an area of safe space, a mother has little cause to restrain her child, nor, owing to other attractions around, to entertain or otherwise divert him. In order to deduce which of the women and infants make up kinship pairs, the observer postulates criteria for recognizing a pair; attachment is then conceived of as factors which identify a mother and her infant in field conditions. The infant detaches himself from his mother but he maintains proximity to her, particularly around the age of 2 years, when his proximity- and contact-seeking are at their height. Yet, at this age, the infant shows most alertness to remote events. From 2 years old onwards, the presence of age-mates competes for the infant's proximity. Hence, the statistical data presented below is from observations which were made when the likelihood of interruption by neighbouring people was minimal. Proximity to the mother can be defined as the child's being at rest beside her, or as his playing in her vicinity, or as a pattern of exploratory locomotion with the mother the centre of the territory he covers. In each of these aspects, the behaviour of 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds is distinguished by typical distances from the mother. The infant's responsiveness to unexpected sights or sounds is inferred from the orientation responses he makes to them. In his postures and the distances he takes up from the mother, his feeling-states of alertness, fear, anger, uncertainty, fatigue and conflict are expressed; when thus activated, he tends to relate himself to his mother.",

A sociological investigation into the causes of violation of the usually very stringet incest taboo reveals the importance of the typical life-history in these social strata, showing a unique configuration of circumstances. Home is usually left at a very early age; broken homes, psychological tension between the parents, and frequency of child labor tend to minimize the educational influences. The occupational life shows a frequency of change of jobs and even occupations. A declining trend in the occupational career will be observed at the inception of incestuous behavior. Sometime before the beginning of the incestuous relationship between father and daughter the routine of everyday life suffers and interruption from such a cause as accident, economic trouble, or disease. In almost all cases of father-daughter-incest-by far the most frequent type-the father suffers extreme sexual frustation, having been refused sexual intercourse with his wife. These different instances of the life-history have to be integrated into a comprehensive conception of the social attitudes of the patient. Thus, incest is regarded as due to indifference toward social responsibilities and coinciding with an extreme frustation of the sexual drive.",

      "title": "‘Being Actively Confident in All Contexts’: A Qualitative Exploration of Thriving as an Emerging Adult of Diverse Sexual Orientation",
      "abstract": "When one thrives, they grow, develop and succeed. For people of diverse sexual orientations (DSO) thriving within one's sexuality is often restricted by heteronormativity, minority stress and poor mental health outcomes. Particularly at risk, are DSO \"emerging adults\" aged between 18–29 years who seek stability before transitioning to adulthood. Therefore, this qualitative study interviewed 12 participants between the ages of 18–29 years to investigate perceptions of thriving within one's sexuality and factors that may foster or hinder its occurrence. The results indicated participants perceived thriving as a spectrum of states and processes involving a sense of personal safety with high levels of self-acceptance to believe one could exist freely as a person of DSO. The findings suggested thriving within one's sexuality during emerging adulthood is fostered through the factors of seeking personal growth, social representation/visibility, affirming social support and opportunities to support other DSO people. In contrast, identity denial, unsupportive social environments, erasure/tokenism, and experiences of discrimination eroded one's ability to thrive. Psychological interventions focusing on establishing a strong sense of identity, building a social support network and encouragement to seek thriving opportunities, may foster thriving experiences for Australian DSO emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "Suppression of reproduction refers to the inhibition or impairment of reproductive development, reproductive physiology, and/or reproductive behavior in response to social stimuli. In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‐ranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‐sex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

Adolescence is a time of important biological, physiological, neurological, behavioural and social transitions towards adulthood. This period of transition is characterised by higher impulsivity, increased sensation-seeking behaviour, higher risk-taking behaviours relating to substance use and/or sexual experimentation, an increased sense of self-awareness/invincibility, and a higher importance of social relationships involving partners and peers rather than parents and older siblings. Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

These fantasies may be extended, enriched, and socialized through a variety of means, including interactions with peers, various cultural means, and pornography. Adolescents also commonly defend against awareness of these conflicts by denying their significance and conceptualizing them as mere stimulants or concomitants of physiologic arousal. Internet pornography provides a particularly powerful means by which some adolescents can disguise or obliterate the meaning of personal masturbation fantasies and so be spared the anxiety associated with the fantasies and their conflicted meaning.",

      "title": "Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale",
      "abstract": "In the early 1980's, there was a startling realization that children are often sexually victimized by other children. With this understanding has come a serious confusion as to what constitutes normative sexual expression and what is sexual exploitation. This article discusses the two stances that have been prevalent: 1) discourage or ignore sexual behavior in children and hope that it goes away, or 2) persistent sexual behavior, particularly with other children, is either pathological or a definitive sign of emerging pathology. The disparity and myopic nature of both positions makes them unacceptable. How do we then take a more balanced and accurate view of childhood sexual expression, given our new sensitivity to children exhibiting sexually offending behavior? The Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale is presented as a tool to take into consideration normative sexual themes and behavior in children and the possibility of developing sexual pathology. The Discovery that Children are Sexual Beings Historically, it is difficult to determine just when the realization occurred that children, as well as adults, are sexual creatures with all the resulting ramifications. From a sociological perspective, it is clear that what our culture still considers part of childhood (11 to 18 years of age) in many cultures would have already undergone the rite of passage to adulthood. With this passage comes the responsibilities and privileges associated with adulthood—work, conscription into the army, leaving home, taking a partner, and freedom to be sexually active. Presently, in third-world nations, large percentages of their armed forces are younger than the legal age to view rated movies in the United States. It is ironic to the point of absurdity what children in our culture are exposed to, concerning sexuality and the restrictions we place on their response to this exposure. Television, movies, magazines and even comic books frequently depict mild-to-strong sexual themes such as nudity, sexual suggestiveness, sexual behavior and sexualized dominance and violence. Yet, about the only culturally agreed upon sexual behavior of children is to ask a biology question or two. When it comes to sexuality, the disparity between the physical or hormonal clock and the cultural clock exacerbates the difficulty.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction, which is also known as hypersexual disorder, has largely been ignored by psychiatrists, even though the condition causes serious psychosocial problems for many people. A lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, people who were categorized as having a compulsive, impulsive, addictive sexual disorder or a hypersexual disorder reported having obsessive thoughts and behaviors as well as sexual fantasies. Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/ hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches. Psychiatric and somatic comorbidities that frequently occur with sexual addiction should be integrated into the therapeutic process. Group-based treatments should also be attempted.

We know that recognition of the psychological sense of self as distant from the other is achieved in most infants during the second half of the first year of life. The child's dyadic relationship slowly merges into the oedipal triadic relationship with the parents by the end of the fourth year, ushering in a severely conflictual situation for children of both sexes. Curiosity about sexuality gives way, under reasonably adequate psychological conditions, to curiosity about the wider aspects of the world, a sublimation of a portion of sexual as well as aggressive wishes that continues into adult life unless inhibitions arise because of psychological conflicts that were insufficiently resolved during the pre-oedipal and oedipal periods.",

Existen varios mitos y estereotipos en torno a la sexualidad de las personas con discapacidad; la misma gente es capaz de mermar drásticamente la expresión sexual de estas personas, como pensar que son asexuales y que dependen de los demás. También existe una devaluación de la percepción corporal que dificulta apreciarse como un sujeto sexualmente atractivo. A esto se suman otros factores que pueden ser considerados un obstáculo para la vida sexual, como el dolor, el uso de fármacos, incontinencia urinaria o fecal, la dificultad para adoptar ciertas posiciones para realizar el coito e incluso el temor a la muerte. Es indudable que la vida sexual de las personas discapacitadas tiene una especificidad, bien en sí misma, bien por las condiciones en que pueden vivirla. Cada discapacidad supone una cierta especificidad en la forma de vivir la sexualidad, cada discapacitado y cada contexto familiar y social también, los discapacitados tienen posibilidades y formas muy diferentes de vivir la sexualidad. Las personas con discapacidad, son personas sexuales y tienen un amplio rango de necesidades emocionales y sexuales y los mismos problemas que las personas con cuerpos hábiles.

For gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, this questioning phase is often triggered by feeling sexual attraction to someone of the same sex or gender; however, for asexual individuals, questioning may start with the realization that the person does not feel—and has never felt—sexual attraction to anyone, regardless of sex or gender. Thus, psychotherapists and other counselors have an ethical duty to respect their clients’ sexual orientation and not to discriminate against, deny service to, or demean clients on the basis of sexual orientation. Because asexuality is newly recognized as a sexual orientation, however, relatively few resources exist on cultural competency with asexual or potentially asexual clients. Finally, asexual individuals may have to navigate the implications of their asexuality in terms of cultural and social expectations for sex, relationships, and childbearing.",

An intensive and detailed personal interview was conducted with 260 women in the immediate post-partum period concerning their sexual behavior during pregnancy. It was found that for most women coital activity declines in a linear fashion once pregnancy is discovered. Orgasmic activity, sexual interest and noncoital behavior are similarly affected. The decrease in noncoital behavior, such as mutual oral-genital stimulation suggests that more than attitudes and comfort with sexuality are involved. Despite the significant and steady reduction in sexual behavior for most women, some increased their activity, reflecting the highly individualistic nature of human sexuality and response to pregnancy. The decrease or increase in sexual activity is not predictable by socioeconomic or other demographic factors. There was no relation between sexual activity and prematurity.

      "abstract": "Although rates of sexual aggression are high among college men who engage in heavy drinking, little is known regarding how often heavy drinking college men initiate unwanted sexual advances towards women that could lead to a potential sexual assault or the reasons why these advances stop or proceed. The present study describes heavy drinking college men’s ( N = 210) initiation of unwanted sexual and social advances towards women, as well as outcomes of these interactions, including how often these behaviors continue, and men’s perception of what stopped the behavior over a 3-month period. Men indicated whether they were in a situation where a sexual partner noted that she does not want sexual activity to proceed further, initiated unwanted sexual contact, initiated unwanted sexual intercourse, attempted to give a woman alcohol when she did not appear to want to drink, or attempted to take a woman to an isolated location when she did not appear to want to go. These unwanted sexual and social advances most often stopped because of women’s verbal resistance (i.e., saying “stop” or “no”), or because men engaged in a discussion regarding the women’s limits or choices. Given that none of the unwanted sexual or social advances stopped because of bystander intervention, the present study highlights the importance of raising awareness of the effectiveness of women’s resistance tactics and continuing to train bystanders to notice and take action to address risky situations.",

Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

If they do not have direct sexual intercourse, the pedophile can satisfy his lust by interacting online with the victim in the form of erotic chat, sending pictures and videos, and audio that triggers sexual arousal. The object of pedophilia itself is minors and does not look at gender. The type of research used in this article is normative by utilizing laws, pedophilia books, and mass media in the form of articles. Research data shows that there is confusion in convicting a pedophile. This is because pedophilia can be classified as a mental disorder, psychological condition, or more towards sexual orientation. This deviant behavior will certainly damage the growth and development of a child as a future generation. This deviant behavior must be stopped. When the perpetrator begins to realize there is a sexual disorder, the perpetrator must consult his condition to a psychologist.

Scientists have learned that very young infants experience shame (as a personal feeling of unworthiness and shame), when they experience rejection-even if it is unintentional. Children, who are admonished for doing something over which they have limited or no control, are also capable of feeling shame. On a more serious, long-lasting scale, physical and sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences, particularly those that happen directly to the child, without adequate intervention, may lead to the development of shame as well. Considering the origin of the shame-wound is critical as well. If one is the child of abusive and/or addicted parents, their shame could have been an emotional and psychological transplant. Assessing if the shame is a consequence of actions, inactions, or someone elses conflicts, can allow for internal conflict resolution.",

      "title": "Event Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetration Against Romantic Partners Versus Non-Romantic Partners",
      "abstract": "Tactics used to perpetrate sexual violence may be crucial to understanding when and why sexual violence occurs. Moreover, most sexual violence occurs between people who know each other—including in the context of dating or sexual relationships. Little is known about the context of sexual violence that occurs with non-romantic partners. To address these research gaps, we examined online survey data from 786 young adults (weighted n = 763) aged 19 to 27 years, living across the United States. Findings suggest that 60% of sexual assault, 40% of attempted rape, 42% of rape, and 67% of coercive sex were perpetrated against a romantic partner, defined as a current or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, or domestic partner. Contextual differences were noted by relationship type: Those who perpetrated against romantic partners were more likely than those who targeted non-romantic partners to report that it occurred because they were feeling sad or angry. They were also more likely to say that the other person was completely responsible for what happened. Conversely, those who aggressed against non-romantic partners were more likely to say that someone else found out about what happened. Making the other person feel guilty was the most common tactic for both groups. The most frequently endorsed reason for perpetrating sexual violence was “feeling really horny,” although feeling “good” or being drunk/high were also common reasons noted by aggressors. Afterward, many said they felt guilty or ashamed and were worried about the other person’s feelings. Fear of getting caught was universally absent. Findings support the importance of building emotion regulation and emotional awareness skills in sexual violence prevention programming. Prevention programs should also discuss coercion as a violence tactic, since perpetrators may not always recognize this to be sexual violence. More generally, violence prevention programs should also address healthy relationships, consent, and taking responsibility.",

      "abstract": "Keberadaan gay di Indonesia tidak dapat diterima masyarakat, alasan apapun yang diberikan oleh kaum homoseksual ditolak masyarakat karena tidak sesuai dari segi moral, agama, dan norma budaya. Permasalahan yang berkembang di masyarakat membuat kelompok gay harus menggunakan simbol-simbol yang secara tidak langsung menunjukkan identitas dirinya dengan menggunakan komunikasi non verbal. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui simbol komunikasi yang digunakan oleh kaum gay di Pekanbaru dalam mencari pasangan. Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif dalam bentuk studi fenomenologi dengan melakukan observasi, dokumentasi dan wawancara mendalam terhadap subjek penelitian yang terdiri dari empat orang gay, satu orang teman gay, dan satu orang psikolog. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kaum gay menggunakan komunikasi non verbal dalam mencari pasangan adalah sebagai berikut: pertama, simbol kontak mata ditandai dengan menatap pria lain secara lirik-lirikan beberapa kali dan menatap lebih lama ke arah pria yang menjadi target, biasanya lebih dari tiga detik dan dilakukan secara berulang-ulang. Kedua, simbol gerakan tubuh lebih terlihat pada gay yang berperan sebagai wanita, cara berjalan, gerakan tangan, pembawaan diriya yang gemulai bahkan dari cara memegang benda dapat terlihat dengan sangat jelas. Ketiga, simbol penampilan, jika gaya tipe top seperti pria metroseksual sedangkan bottom berpenampilan feminim. Keempat, simbol ekspresi wajah, yaitu menampilkan ekspresi wajah bahagia, senyum-senyum yang menggoda dan mengedipkan mata.Kata Kunci: Komunikasi non verbal, Gay, LGBT, Fenomenologi",

      "title": "Braving the erotic field in the treatment of adolescents",
      "abstract": "Erotic transference and countertransference can be particularly fraught because of the intensity of emergent bodily sensations in the adolescent and because of her or his normal developmental immaturity. And yet, with rare exceptions, the area of erotic transference/countertransference in the treatment of adolescents is largely ignored in analytic writing. The catastrophic prospect of boundary violations, particularly with minors, can lead to a timid avoidance of the erotic in the work with adolescents, yielding is term as ‘erotic insufficiency’. The body of the adolescent is changing radically before his or her own, as well as the eyes. The emerging bodily experiences of the adolescent (first menstruation, first wet dream, first masturbation to orgasm, etc.) are parts of a ‘virgin territory’. Timid avoidance of erotic feelings in the consulting room deprives adolescents of sincere adult thinking in relation to allowing and managing sexual feelings.",

      "title": "Demenza e comportamento sessuale",
      "abstract": "Sebbene la sessualita, i sentimenti e l’intimita rimangano aspetti importanti della vita nelle persone anziane e nei soggetti affetti da Demenza, un falso mito persistente nella societa vorrebbe i pazienti affetti da Demenza asessuati ed i desideri ed i bisogni di relazione come qualcosa di destinato a dissolversi con l’avanzare dell’eta. In realta la sessualita espressa da pazienti con Demenza puo essere espressa, talora drammaticamente, sotto forma di comportamenti sessuali inappropriati (ISB). Sulla definizione di tali sintomi comportamentali, non c’e al momento, nella letteratura scientifica internazionale una concordanza di vedute, tuttavia gli ISB comprendono una qualsiasi forma di agito verbale o fisico messo in atto in un contesto socialmente inappropriato. Esempi di ISB sono: esposizione dei genitali in pubblico o nel luogo di ricovero, masturbazione in pubblico e forme di aggressione sessuale nei confronti di degenti, operatori o familiari tanto che questi aspetti sono spesso fonte di preoccupazione, imbarazzo e fatica per chi si relaziona con questa tipologia di pazienti. La ricerca e di conseguenza la letteratura disponibile sui trattamenti e al momento piuttosto limitata. Interventi di tipo non farmacologico (tecniche comportamentali, strategie di distrazione, terapia occupazionale) possono essere efficaci se personalizzate. Numerosi trattamenti farmacologici (con antidepressivi, antiandrogeni, antipsicotici, ed anticonvulsivanti) vengono utilizzati empiricamente, tuttavia solo poche evidenze sono disponibili nella letteratura scientifica riguardo l’efficacia e la consistenza degli effetti collaterali, tanto che non esistono chiare linee guida in grado di precisare quali siano da considerare trattamenti di prima o di seconda linea.",

Middle age normally constitutes the most stressful time for all men. Family responsibilities grow at this stage. The prominent symptom of male climacteric - reduced sexual drive is well defined by Ayurvedic scholars as the state of Jaravasthajanya Klaibya.

In the case of women important role played: emotions, cognitive interpretation of the situation, age, self-esteem and previous sexual experiences. Among women experience orgasm during intercourse or masturbation is not a goal in itself.

      "title": "Juvenility in the context of life history theory",
      "abstract": "Homo sapiens is unique in having four prolonged and pronounced postnatal pre-adult life history stages: infancy, which lasts for 30-36 months and ends with weaning from breast feeding in traditional societies; childhood, which lasts for an additional 2-4 years and concludes in a degree of independence as regards protection and food provision; a juvenile stage of 3-4 years that terminates with readiness for sexual maturation; and adolescence, which lasts for 3-5 years and culminates in fertility. Juvenility implies two transitional periods which are only experienced by humans: a transition from childhood to juvenility and from juvenility to adolescence. Juvenility, \"the age of reason and responsibility\" and concrete operation, coincides with elementary school age and offers opportunities to prepare for the social complexity of adolescence. Here I define the transition to juvenility by three variables: adrenarche (the onset of adrenal androgen generation), growth pattern (decelerating from a linear childhood growth velocity) and adiposity rebound acceleration of body mass index. The data presented suggest that this period is endowed with programming/predictive adaptive responses of body composition to the environment.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is an integral part of well-being across the life course. For older people with disabilities (PWD), age and disability status intersect to create unique sexual experiences and needs that have long been stigmatised, resulting in limited access to sexual citizenship. Of particular importance are the socio-cultural realities of ageism and ableism that pose specific challenges to the pursuit of sexual wellness, and can serve to invalidate and/or inhibit access to a rich and beneficial intimate life. These realities are impacted by the varied biological, psychological, social and cultural factors across the life course to shape the sexual trajectory of older PWD. This chapter examines sexual citizenship for older PWDs via a life-course perspective, while considering the biological, psychological, social and cultural influences on the sexual trajectory.

The vascular and nervous supply of the urinary and genital system make their relationship one of more than mere position, and so it would not be strange if the development and function of one exercised some influence on the other. Guyon,<sup>1</sup>at any rate, emphasized the venous engorgement of the sexual organs on distention of the bladder.

Using procedures adapted from research on prosocial behavior in chimpanzees, we presented 18‐ and 25‐month‐old children with a sharing task in which they could choose to deliver food to themselves only, or to both themselves and another person, thereby making it possible for them to share without personal sacrifice. The potential recipient, a friendly adult, was either silent about her needs and wants or made them explicit. Both younger and older toddlers chose randomly when the recipient was silent. However, when the recipient vocalized her desires 25‐month‐olds shared, whereas younger children did not. Thus, we demonstrate that children voluntarily share valued resources with others by the end of the second year of life, but that this depends on explicit communicative cues about another's need or desire.",

Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one’s daughter’s sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents’ reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

      "abstract": "El abuso sexual se refiere a cualquier conducta sexual mantenida entre dos personas (al menos, una de ellas, menor), entre las que existe una situacion de desigualdad -ya sea por razones de edad o de podery en la que el menor es utilizado para la estimulacion sexual de la otra persona. Mas que la diferencia de edad -factor, sin duda, fundamental que distorsiona toda posibilidad de relacion libremente consentida-, lo que define el abuso es la asimetria entre los implicados en la relacion y la presencia de coaccion -explicita o implicita(Lopez, 1997; Sosa y Capafons, 1996). No deja por ello de ser significativo que el 20 por ciento del abuso sexual infantil este provocado por otros menores. Las conductas abusivas incluyen un contacto fisico (genital, anal o bucal), o suponen una utilizacion del menor como objeto de estimulacion sexual del agresor (exhibicionismo o voyeurismo), o incluso de terceras personas, como cuando se utiliza a un nino para la produccion de pornografia (Madansky, 1996). . No es facil determinar la incidencia real de este problema en la poblacion porque ocurre habitualmente en un entorno privado -la familiay los menores pueden sentirse impotentes para revelar el abuso (Nogueral, 1997). Segun el informe de Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis y Smith (1990) -primera encuesta nacional de Estados Unidos, llevada a cabo en adultos, sobre la historia de abuso sexual-, un 27 por ciento de las mujeres y un 16 por ciento de los hombres reconocian, retrospectivamente, haber sido victimas de abusos sexuales en la infancia. En Espana, la frecuencia de los abusos, al menos en un sentido muy amplio del termino, puede afectar al 20 por ciento de la poblacion (23 por ciento de chicas y 15 por ciento de chicos). Al margen de esta tasa de prevalencia-ya de por si muy alta-, en el 44 por ciento de los casos el abuso no se ha limitado a un acto aislado (Lopez, 1995, 1997).",

This latter group often overlaps with the group I am concerned with. For years mystery enveloped the causes of such individual antisocial behavior as fire-setting, stealing, truancy, and unacceptable sexuality displayed by young delinquents or their adult counterparts, the psychopaths. As the result of 10 years of study and concomitant treatment of the parents as well as of the child involved in the antisocial behavior, it became unmistakably evident to Szurek and me that one or occasionally both parents derive unconscious and, less frequently, conscious, vicarious gratification of of their own",

What pleases women is the use of their bodies to satisfy male desires. The participants so treated in virtually all heterosexual pornography are women or children, so heterosexual pornography is, as a matter of fact, material which endorses sexual behavior that is degrading and/or abusive to women and children. Control of pornography diminishes freedom—directly the freedom of pornographers, indirectly that of all of us.

      "title": "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual behavior is ubiquitous and diverse. Beyond the sex act itself, sexuality permeates our culture and our daily lives. Therefore, as with all of the behavioral disorders, distinguishing “normal” from “abnormal” sexuality can be difficult. For example, there are no bright lines separating “low” sexual desire from “normal” sexual desire, or “premature” ejaculation from “normal” ejaculation. Whether a person even is bothered by a particular aspect of his or her sexuality is significantly influenced by personality, previous developmental experience, extent of education about sex, satisfaction with one’s relationships in general, and surrounding cultural attitudes about sex. Consider premature ejaculation. DSM-IV defines this as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration, and before the person wishes it. The definition is deliberately subjective, taking into account the quality of the individual’s sexual relationship. Paradoxically, this subjective definition may be more reliable and valid than a definition based on the exact interval between penetration and ejaculation as measured by a stopwatch. Thus, while a man who ejaculates within a minute of vaginal entry might be considered by some people to be “premature,” if he and his wife engage in a half-hour of very pleasurable foreplay, followed by mutual orgasms after a minute of pleasurable intercourse, he could not be considered to have a sexual “dys function.”",

Regret following male-to-female sex-reassignment surgery (SRS) and facial plastic surgery; requesting sexreconversion operation. Compulsive, high-risk sexual behaviour, triggered by traumatic life-events during puberty (death of father and departure of mother at the age of 14). Symptoms evolved throughout adolescence and adulthood with persistent identity diffusion, intense abandonment fears, feelings of chronic emptiness and guilt, mood swings, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and self-destructive behaviour. Gender history and transition: No evidence of gender nonconformity, gender dysphoria, gender-role discomfort or cross-gender identification. Uncertainty regarding male's role and identity diffusion, persisting since puberty. An impulsive decison for SRS and facial plastic surgery at the age of 40 (performed abroad), without a recommendation letter, motivated by the urge to resolve identity confusion and diminish compulsive sexual behaviour. He subsequently acknowledged his male identity, which led to relief of symptoms and request for sex-reconversion surgery. Gender history and clinical presentation confirmed that the patient did not sufficiently meet criteria for Gender Identity Disorder, but rather for Borderline Personality Disorder. The authors are highly aware that this topic is significantly connected to issues of the human right to free choice; however we would wish to impose a medical obligation for a rigorous psychiatric assessment for origin of gender identity diffusion and discomfort. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy should be the first treatment choices before any radical surgery interventions are undertaken.",

By the later Middle Ages a stable set of terms divided childhood into seven-year segments: infantia (infancy), pueritia (childhood), and adolescentia (adolescence). These demarcations were based primarily upon age but also considered the social, emotional, and mental development of the individual. Prior to the age of seven or infantia, an infant girl was not considered to be a fully rational and responsible agent. The transition to pueritia was marked by growing personal awareness and social accountability, and the move into adolescentia was marked by the onset of menarche and secondary sexual characteristics. At adolescentia, regarded as twelve for girls and fourteen for boys, young people could marry according to canon law or could break a marriage contract arranged in their childhood by paying a fine equivalent to the value of the marriage. Although remaining unmarried was a possibility, the life options available to most girls were limited to marriage, religious vocation, or some form of domestic employment or household management. The social ideal, of course, was for young medieval girls to marry and have children, for the normative course of secular life led a girl directly from her father’s house as a child and daughter to her husband’s house as a wife and mother.",

In the United States, some states refer in general terms to sexual abuse, while others specify various acts as abusive in nature. There are many types of sexual violence, including child sexual abuse and sexual assault. As in a multitude of other pediatric and adolescent diagnoses, the first step to the diagnosis of child sexual abuse is being aware of and acknowledging the problem that patients face. The overwhelming majority of children and adolescents with a history of sexual abuse present for an informed medical exam at a time remote from the event of their abuse. Adverse childhood experiences, among which sexual abuse figures largely, have consistently been linked with poor mental and physical health in adulthood. Pregnancy or the detection of sperm/semen is diagnostic of sexual contact.",

      "title": "THE PSYCHOLOGIC ASPECTS OF PEDIATRIC PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "In spite of the fact that masturbation involves almost all human beings in every culture, comparatively little has been written on the subject. Until very recently masturbation was defined in the medical literature as a sexual perversion and a damaging activity to be prohibited at all costs. In the beliefs of certain religious faiths masturbation is considered a sin. The evolution of masturbatory activity as observed from infancy through adolescence is presented. Masturbation can be understood as a \"discharge phenomenon\" undertaken to relieve a state of tension existing in the human body. As the child develops he is normally subjected to increased tensions due to restrictions and frustrations forced upon him by the family and culture. Being permitted no normal outlet, he resorts to the release he has known from infancy, and has the fantasy that certain forbidden or temporarily impossible wishes take place. The feelings of guilt, increased by parental attitudes, are associated with a fear of having damaged their sexual organs and a fear of consequent ill health. Excessive masturbation as defined, must be viewed as a symptom of the child's unhappiness or emotional instability. The role of the pediatrician is to explain ordinary masturbation to the parent as a normal physiologic function. When the physician is presented with the problem of a child with excessive masturbation he should attempt to detect factors responsible for an emotional upset.",

      "abstract": "Sexual development is one of the significant traits in an organism’s life because it is closely related to its genetic fitness. The only legacy we pass into subsequent generations are germ cells in the developing gonads. [1] In sex development, there are two distinguishably different processes, namely sex determination and sex differentiation. Sex determination is the developmental decision that directs the bipotential gonad into a sexually dimorphic individual. [2] Sexual differentiation is how the male and female sexual organs develop from bipotential embryonic structures. It involves sequential stages, namely genetic, gonadal, hormonal, phenotypic, and psychological. At the genetic stage, chromosomal sex is determined by the chromosomal constitution after fertilization, where XY denotes male and XX indicates female. Until the sixth week of embryonic life, no sexual difference is observable in the fetus. Undifferentiated gonads of XX or XY are similar in morphology and can form either ovaries or testes. Differentiation of bipotential gonad into either ovaries or testes occurs in the gonadal stage. Followed by gonadal differentiation, the internal genital tract and the external genitalia develop into male or female structures in the phenotypic stage. [3] [4]",

      "abstract": "Abstract Can aggression be studied in an ethical manner? Aggression is a behavior found almost universally in the animal kingdom. It is defined as a hostile act that poses a threat to another creature. It is exhibited in many ways, including threatening body movements, vocalization, fighting, wounding and inflicting pain, sexual attack, and killing. Commonly, animals act aggressively to exclude others from their territory, to capture food, or to control populations. Displays of aggression are influenced by age (newborns and infants below a certain age do not show aggression), by the physical environment, by previous social experience, and by the aggression level in a particular community. One manifestation of aggression is infanticide—the killing of infants by adults. It occurs in several species of animal. Human infanticide is practiced in several cultures to control population, to favor the birth of a particular sex (usually male), and in waging war. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, biologists reported anecdotal observations of infanticide in both male and female wild animals.",

      "abstract": "The central premise of this paper is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In other words, they are like the more ordinary sexual preferences with which we are familiar. As such, they generate sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals will be strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them will be unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct in not trusting the individuals with such preferences and thus in attempting to monitor or control them. However, most efforts to do so appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "abstract": "Research on casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) has increased in the last decade; however, there is no consensus about the scope and definition of CSREs. To describe the main forms of CSREs, a latent profile analysis was performed on single and sexually active men and women aged from 18 to 30 years old who described their last casual sexual experience. Five profiles were identified: 1) the one-time sexual encounter; 2) the ex-romantic partnership, in which one still has sexual contact after ending their romantic relationship; 3) the mostly about sex partnership, in which contacts are primarily sexual, whether or not a friendship exists; 4) the intimate and sexual partnership, a hybrid of friend and romantic partner with whom one has frequent sexual and social interactions without commitment or intent to form a couple; 5) the friendship first partnership, a friendship to which sex is added, where social activities and friendly interactions dominate. Participants across profiles differed according to the number of sexual partners in the past year, their intention of having other sexual contacts with the partner, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the most recent sexual encounter with their partner and their type of sexual exclusivity agreement. This research contributes to a better description and understanding of CSREs among young adults and to further specifying its area of investigation.",

Conversely, adult interest in sex tended to be lowest when neither masturbation nor sex with a partner had occurred prior to 18 years of age.

Other psychosocial risk factors are related to low socioeconomic status (due to increased exposure to precarious conditions because, although there are no significant differ ences between socioeconomic strata, people from the lowest levels have more severe depression), unemployment (especially men), social isolation, legal problems, experiences of violence, substance abuse and migration. Thus, in general, it seems that women’s mental health is more vulnerable to be affected by certain social factors; however, it is also likely that men underreport mental health problems because of their difficulty to seek help if any emo tional distress afflicts them. Likewise, it has been noted that depression in men can be “hidden” behind addictive and risk behaviors as well as behind irritability and impulsivity. 7",

Mothers were told before fathers, largely because mothers asked or because youth wanted to share their life with them; fathers were told by someone other than their child or by the youth because it was time. The reason participants did not disclose to mothers was because it was not the right developmental time; the reason they did not disclose to fathers was because they were not close to them. Sons, more than daughters, feared the negative reactions of parents, who generally reacted in the same manner--supportive or slightly negative. Relationships with parents since disclosure generally had not changed or had improved. Sex of parent mattered more than sex of child on most domains.",

      "abstract": "Child abuse is the physical or psychological maltreatment of a child, can be differentiated into four major categories, physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and worst of all; the sexual abuse. Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a kind of physical or mental violation of a child with sexual intent, usually by a person who is in a position of trust or power vis-a-vis the child. India is the second largest child population in the world, 42% of India's total population is below eighteen years. In a shocking revelation, a Government commissioned survey has found that more than 53% of Indian children are subjected to sexual abuse/assault. Majority of these cases were perpetrated by someone known to the child or in a position of trust and responsibility, Not surprisingly, most children did not report the abuse to anyone.",

      "title": "Issues and challenges in sexuality and sex education in Intellectually Disabled",
      "abstract": "All human beings are sexual from birth to death, and the Intellectually Disabled (ID) are not exempt from this. The issues of sexual needs and sexual behaviour of the ID have been a sensitive and controversial topic. Perhaps because of the taboos associated with Intellectual Disability and sexuality, individually or in combination, very little is known about the sexuality of people with ID, but research studies do indicate that it is much the same as the general population, although opportunities for sexual expression are limited. This article provides an overview of sexuality issues in ID, with regard to sexual rights, sexual development and maturation, menstruation and menstrual hygiene, masturbation, petting, sexual activity, marriage, pregnancy, parenting, sexual abuse, fertility and birth control, menopause, and the progress and issues in sexuality education for ID. Prior research shows that individuals with ID show secondary sexual characteristics and development similar to that of intellectually averaged peers; those in the lower range of functioning develop those characteristics at a slower pace. ID children often neglect menstruation and are non-co operative in menstrual grooming due to poor understanding, irritability, fatigue and increased seizure. Research reports vaginal hysterectomy as management of this. They show a lower rate of offspring production than the non retarded. It is estimated that ID children are sexually victimized at 4-10 times the rate of the general population, 39-83% of girls and 16-32% of boys experience sexual abuse before they reach the age of 18. Parents and professionals are pessimistic in the sexual needs of people with IDD and consider them as asexual. There is an urgent need for development of methods to teach them about sexuality and sexual abuse prevention, since research on sex education revealed poor generalization of skills to real life situations. In situ training revealed better generalization, but has the issue of causing emotional distress and dissonance among ID.",

      "title": "A New Perspective on Gender Dysphoria and Repetitive Sex Reassignment Surgeries",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Gender identity disorder (GID), also known as gender dysphoria or transgender identity, refers to the experience of major dysphoria or dissatisfaction with the sex that individuals were assigned at birth and the gender responsibilities related to their sex.1,2 Nationwide, stigma attached to transsexualism has made it a commonly shunned condition (with transsexualism also being a commonly shunned term) that can profoundly impact individuals’ lives, especially if left untreated. We present a unique case of repetitive sex reassignment surgeries from male to female and back again to male in a 28-year-old patient and discuss the outcomes.\r\n\r\nCase report. A 28-year-old shy, depressed married man with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder was referred to a psychiatric lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender clinic and explained his sexual identity problem that had caused him depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideas and plans. Although he was married at age 20 years and had fathered 2 children, he was still struggling to be identified as a male. He described his desire to be a girl and how he used to dress up as a girl when he was 5 years old.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the visit, he had divorced his wife, had abandoned his children, and planned to marry his male lover and to live with him as his wife. He was conscious of the impact of his decision on others and was feeling guilty about abandoning his family to marry a male partner, but was unable to restrain himself from carrying out his plans.\r\n\r\nThe patient attended 20 hourly psychiatric sessions over 12 months before presenting to the clinic with no improvement. Further endocrinology evaluations and laboratory workups for hormonal imbalance revealed no abnormalities. He received 20 more hourly psychiatry sessions and cognitive therapy for 6 months with no improvement. He was then referred to urologists for additional evaluation for sex reassignment surgery, which was completed successfully.\r\n\r\nHowever, the patient returned 10 years later with worsening anxiety and depression and suicidal ideas and plans. She stated how she had been married happily and enjoying life with her lover, yet she gradually started struggling with her gender as a female and the desire to switch back to a male. Her symptoms were so severe that she had twice attempted suicide to end her emotional pain.\r\n\r\nShe underwent concurrent psychiatric counseling and rehabilitation for 6 months with no improvement. The decision was made for her to be referred for sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy, which were completed successfully and which were followed by significant improvement in the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up. There was no long-term follow-up on this patient and his fate.\r\n\r\nThere are no recently updated data on the prevalence of gender dysphoria. According to scant research, the prevalence of gender dysphoria is projected to be approximately 1 in 30,000, although this number is thought to significantly underestimate the true prevalence. To ensure quality of life, transgender individuals need professional medical and mental health care to transition from their birth sexual identity to their internal sense of gender.3–5\r\n\r\nEven if the number of gender dysphoric individuals is on the rise, there is little research regarding this population and their health care needs. Given the stigma surrounding this population, they are less likely to receive appropriate help, which can result in further mental and health turmoil.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are individuals who self-identify as transgender and seek extensive interventions to satisfy their internal sense of gender. This group ends up changing their physical appearance frequently from one gender to another. Given the scope of the public health burden of unnecessary repetitive procedures, it is important to conduct more comprehensive studies on this population to make sure they receive appropriate treatment and to prevent unnecessary costs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, investigating gender dysphoria and the individuals’ transition over time can benefit the treatment of psychiatric disorders among transgender individuals. It is a responsibility of psychiatrists to explore the patient’s hidden motives behind change of gender to help that patient attain a greater inner relational freedom.",

      "abstract": "THERE ARE few aspects of human existence of greater importance to the clinician than that of sexual behavior. Yet there is probably no other major sphere of man's dailylife so poorly understood and so infrequently and ineptly studied as his sexual behavior. Some of the sexual taboos typical of our culture have been relaxed appreciably during the past two or three decades; but social convention still raises discouraging barriers to the experimental investigation of human sexuality. It is to be earnestly hoped that direct, intensive study of the physiological and psychological bases for sexual arousal and the resultant overt behavior in human beings will become possible in the near future. Investigations of this character have been conducted with animals other than man, and no physician need be reminded of the great body of currently useful medical knowledge which was originally derived from experimentation with animals. Many recent studies of sexual behavior in lower mammals have yielded data which appear to have a direct bearing upon the understanding of human sexual reactions.",

      "title": "Schone schijn of niet? Een fake good/fake bad onderzoek naar de invloed van een mannelijke of vrouwelijke onderzoeker op de sociale wenselijkheid bij een vragenlijst over emancipatie",
      "abstract": "Sociaal wenselijk gedrag is een fenomeen dat voor bijna iedereen bekend zal zijn, of het nu is om jezelf in bescherming te nemen of om een ander niet te kwetsen. Het aanpassen van gedrag of mening om niet af te wijken van sociale normen komt veel voor, zowel in het dagelijks leven als in wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Veel voorkomende situaties zijn: het niet geven van een eerlijke, negatieve mening over iemand anders of het niet willen bespreken van persoonlijke informatie over financien of seksueel gedrag. Dit gedrag komt ook terug in wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar onder meer politieke en maatschappelijke opinies. Het kan er voor zorgen dat resultaten onbetrouwbaar worden en onderzoek onbruikbaar wordt. Het blijkt dat onderzoeken naar persoonlijke gegevens, zoals stemgedrag of seksualiteit, gevoelig zijn voor sociaal wenselijk gedrag. Respondenten in een onderzoek met gevoelige vragen geven antwoorden waarmee ze een betere indruk van zichzelf denken achter te laten of geven antwoorden die beter aansluiten bij de algemene publieke opinie. Om dit sociaal wenselijk gedrag in onderzoek te ondervangen, is het belangrijk te weten wanneer er een grote kans is op sociaal wenselijk gedrag door respondenten en welke maatregelen dit gedrag verminderen. \r\nEen onderwerp waarvan wordt verwacht dat het gevoelig is voor sociale wenselijkheid, is emancipatie. Er zijn al veel gelijke rechten tussen mannen en vrouwen, vooral in de westerse wereld, maar nog steeds blijkt dat vrouwen op veel gebieden een achtergestelde positie hebben ten opzichte van mannen. Vrouwen krijgen minder salaris voor hetzelfde werk, bekleden minder posities op topniveau en zijn meer verantwoordelijk voor zorgtaken dan mannen (Portegijs, 2010). Een actuele situatie is de verkiezing van een nieuwe Amerikaanse president. Was Barack Obama bijna acht jaar geleden de eerste gekleurde president van Amerika, nu is Hillary Clinton in de race om de eerste vrouw te worden die deze functie bekleedt. Dat niet iedereen even gelukkig zou zijn met een vrouwelijke president, komt naar voren in het onderzoek van Streb et al. (2008). In de publieke opinie was er grote steun voor een vrouwelijke president van Amerika, maar in het onderzoek naar de sociale wenselijkheid van die opinie bleek dat het een heel gevoelig onderwerp is. Ruim een kwart van de respondenten gaf aan zelfs van slag te zijn bij het vooruitzicht dat een vrouw leider zou worden van het land en stelde de antwoorden voor de opiniepeiling overdreven positief te hebben ingevuld (Streb et al, 2008).\r\nSociale wenselijkheid is hiermee een interessant onderwerp om verder te onderzoeken, vooral in combinatie met een maatschappelijk relevant thema als emancipatie. In deze scriptie staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: heeft het opnemen van geslachtkenmerken van de onderzoeker in de instructie en vragenlijst invloed op de sociale wenselijkheid van de respons? De vragenlijst die in dit onderzoek wordt meegenomen is afkomstig van de Eurobarometer 2015. Dit is een onderzoek dat eerder door de Europese Unie is uitgezet om in verschillende Europese landen te meten wat de opinie is over emancipatie en ongelijkheid tussen mannen en vrouwen. Nederland is niet meegenomen in het onderzoek, wat betekent dat de vragen zijn vertaald alsmede zijn aangepast aan de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie. \r\nHet onderzoek is verricht volgens de fake good/fake bad methode om te meten in welke mate de vragenlijst gevoelig is voor sociaal wenselijke antwoorden. De fake good/fake bad methode is niet bedoeld om de eigen mening van respondenten te achterhalen, maar om te bepalen welke antwoorden sociaal wenselijk of sociaal onwenselijk zijn. Wanneer er een significant verschil bestaat tussen deze twee mogelijkheden, is er sprake van een vragenlijst met gevoelige vragen.",

Even more suggestive is the existence of the clitoris, an organ whose sole function is to provide pleasure. Like the penis, the clitoris makes its anatomical debut well before birth.",

After spinal cord injury (SCI), the modification of neurologic control and its consequences on reproductive organs have been extensively described in humans. Globally, sexual satisfaction decreases but sexuality remains a major concern, specifically after the first year following the injury.1 Moreover, recovery of sexual function is the major concern of paraplegic patients before locomotion,2 after the acute rehabilitation phase. For these specific sequelae/ complications we have to keep in mind that the majority of patients are male and young.3 The impact of the neurologic lesion and its physiologic consequences must be balanced by the fact that the quality of life with respect to sexuality after spinal cord lesion concerns more the relationship with a partner and mental well-being rather than the preservation of sexual ability.1,4 In clinical practice it is well known that this population have specific problems such as dissociation between sensation, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. Such dissociation is only seen in cases of neurologic lesion. Erection can be improved by several treatments, but sensation is not modified, and furthermore the ability to ejaculate during intercourse is not improved by any of the available treatments.",

      "abstract": "INTISARI : Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui penyebab seseorang menjadi biseksual; dan ini terjadi pada orang dewasa yang sudah mempunyai pasangan. Penelitian ini adalah studi kasus dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Penulis juga berhasil mewawancarai 13 Responden atau Informan, orang-orang biseksual, yang berusia antara 30-65 tahun di kota-kota besar di Indonesia. Dengan mengunakan pendekatan fenomenologi dan penjelasan yang deskriptif, hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa fenomena biseksual disebabkan oleh pola asuh orag tua terhadap anaknya; adanya pengalaman masa lalu yang buruk terjadi, seperti pelecehan seksual ataupun korban sodomi; pengaruh lingkungan yang juga membentuk mereka menjadi biseksual; serta ingin mendapatkan kepuasan yang lebih kepada fantasi seksual mereka yang tidak didapatkan pada pasangan resmi mereka. Penelitian ini juga mendapati bahwa media sosial ikut menyumbang dalam mengeksplore keinginan yang dipendam dari mereka yang menjadi biseksual; serta panti pijat ataupun sauna menjadi tempat proses perkenalan sampai dengan melakukan hubungan seksual sesama jenis. Dalam status berhubungan diantara kaum biseksual terdapat dua tipe, yakni kaum biseksual yang memiliki komitmen untuk tetap setia pada pasangan sejenisnya yang satu saja; dan kaum biseksual yang tidak memiliki komitmen, dalam artian hanya untuk bersenang-senang saja dan kerap kali gonta-ganti dalam berhubungan dengan pasangan sejenis. Problema kaum biseksual ini harus difahami secara mendalam, dikaji sebab-sebab dan faktor yang mempengaruhinya, serta dicari cara mengatasi dan jalan keluarnya yang bijak oleh para pengambil kebijakan dalam bidang pendidikan, agama, sosial, kesehatan, dan bahkan politik negara. KATA KUNCI : Kaum Biseksual; Fenomena dan Problematika Sosial; Pola Asuh dalam Pendidikan. ABSTRACT : “Bisexuals and Their Problems in Indonesia”. This study aims to determine the cause of a person being bisexual; and this happens to adults who already have a partner. This research is a case study with a qualitative approach. The Author also successfully interviewed 13 Respondents or Informants, bisexual people, aged between 30-65 years in big cities in Indonesia. By using phenomenological approach and descriptive explanation, the results of the study indicate that the bisexual phenomenon is caused by the parents' upbringing for their children; bad past experiences, such as sexual harassment or victims of sodomy; environmental influences that also shape them to be bisexual; and want to get more satisfaction with their sexual fantasies that are not found in their official partners. The study also found that social media contributed to exploring the buried desires of those who became bisexual; and a massage or sauna as a place for introductions to same-sex sexual relations. In the status of relationships between bisexuals there are two types, namely bisexuals who have a commitment to remain loyal to one partner of the same type; and bisexuals who have no commitment, in the sense of just having fun and often mutually in dealing with same-sex couples. The problem of bisexuals must be understood in depth, examined the causes and factors that influence it, and sought ways to overcome and wise solutions by policy makers in the fields of education, religion, social, health, and even state politics.

Seven themes were found: Minor-focused fantasies, Other paraphilic fantasies, Unrealistic fantasies, Incestuous fantasies, Adult-focused fantasies, Promiscuous fantasies, and Group sex fantasies. The sexual fantasies of adults reporting sexual attraction to minors exhibited diversity both in terms of the individuals involved and in the range of sexual practices imagined. However, much of the sexual fantasy content shared by participants was predominantly of a paraphilic nature. Approximately one-third of the fantasies involved minor as sexual partners, romantic partners, or featured participants imagining themselves as minors. Additionally, nearly half of the disclosed sexual fantasies referenced other paraphilic sexual interests, such as violence, fetishism, exhibitionism/voyeurism, body fluids, and zoophilia. Results of our research highlight the possibility of co-occurring paraphilic interests in adults reporting sexual attraction to minors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Relatively few older adults are physically active despite extensive research exploring barriers and facilitators and concomitant interventions designed to enhance participation rates. Building on the growing literature that considers the subjective experience of being physically active, we explored the meanings that older Canadian men attributed to physical activity broadly defined. Thus, we examined their experiences and perceptions of exercise, sport and/or leisure-time physical activities. Data are presented from qualitative interviews with 22 community-dwelling Canadian men aged 67–90. Our analysis resulted in three overarching categories that subsumed the men's understanding of physical activity. ‘I do it for my health’ described how the men stated that their primary reason for engaging in exercise was to maintain their health and body functionality so that they could age well and continue to participate in sport and leisure. ‘It feels good’ referred to the various ways that the men derived pleasure from being active, including the physical sensations, psychological benefits and social connections they derived from their participation. ‘It gets tougher’ detailed the ways that the men were finding physical activity to be increasingly difficult as a result of the onset of health problems, declining body functionality and the social realities of ageing. We discuss our findings in light of the extant literature concerning age relations, ageism, and the third and fourth ages.",

      "abstract": "Nonconsensual insemination is a battery. It may be a simple battery, aggravated battery, or a sexual battery. Without having received unequivocal, expressed consent, a man who ejaculates inside of an intimate partner commits nonconsensual insemination, which is a battery. Expressed consent is required at each stage of sexual activity. Since insemination, i.e. ejaculating inside a woman, is not intrinsic to having unprotected sex for women or ejaculation for men, then it is an additional sex act that requires expressed consent. Arguments that require victims to use condoms as the best or only means for avoiding nonconsensual insemination amount to victim-blaming. The transmission of disease through nonconsensual ejaculation is specifically prohibited by most states. Unwanted pregnancy that results from sexual battery is as an aggravating factor in many states. The government's demonstrated interest in preventing unwilling contact that causes harm, supports the proposition that reproductive coercion or reckless nonconsensual insemination should be routinely prosecuted. Prosecution should be acknowledged, socially and politically, as one way to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. The principles of therapeutic justice and the current trend to move away from incarceration for nonviolent offenses suggest that this crime should be met with court ordered education, counseling, and perhaps, public shaming (limited/temporary use of sex offender registries), but not incarceration in most instances.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People with disabilities are ten times more likely to suffer from abuse than their typical peers. When lacking knowledge about abuse indicators, these persons are, evidently, unable to report it, which can lead to repeated abuse. Moreover, in many cases, these people do not know that they have the right to decide, refuse, be asked permission (every time), rethink a decision or change their minds. On the other hand, sexuality is often mistaken for sex. Actually, the concept of sexuality is much wider and includes identities, roles, intimacy, pleasure and spirituality. Sexual education and counseling must not be a one-time “talk” (that usually takes place during puberty), but a process of communication, counseling and support which starts at early ages, continues during the school years and goes further, during adulthood. The emotional, psycho-sexual, social, ethical and spiritual aspects also continue their development in the adult life and it is only natural to be properly approached at these ages as well.",

Rather, here it is the marked deviation from the mean towards the ‘non-masculine’ or ‘feminine’ extreme.

      "title": "The Emotional Background of Marital Difficulties",
      "abstract": "I N THE POPULAR MIND, marital difficulties and psychoanalysis are almost synonymous. There is a widespread belief that the majority of individuals who consult a psychoanalyst come because of with marriage. If for conscious dissatisfaction is substituted unconscious with the marital state, the popular belief is correct, for no matter how diverse the symptoms which the psychoneurotic patient presents to the psychoanalyst, closer scrutiny always reveals some psychosexual dissatisfaction. A marital relation in which the ideals of the man's or the woman's personality are realized while at the same time their diverse instinctual needs also find adequate expression is the goal for which men and women are striving in marriage. Yet it is increasingly evident that a large percentage of men and women either cannot marry or, if marriage occurs, can find little happiness in it. Their discontent may find expression in illness, unfaithfulness, psychosexual difficulties such as frigidity and impotence, psychoneurotic or even psychotic manifestations such as depression, delusional jealousy, or alcoholism. Anyone who goes through the case records of any psychiatrist or psychiatric clinic will immediately be struck by the frequent coincidence between an engagement or marriage and the onset of the psychosomatic, psychoneurotic, or psychotic disorder for which the patient is consulting a physician. The patient may be completely unconscious, or more or less of a causal connection between the marriage and the illness. One striking example of the desperate measures which an individual unconsciously took in order to preserve the illusion of a perfect marriage comes to my mind. A married woman of forty was sent by an internist who had been treating her for spastic colitis. In the course of the treatment, he had been struck by something queer in her personality. The woman came to the psychiatric consultation with a very sweet, fixed smile on her face. She protested immediately, before any question could be asked, that she had no need of psychiatric help since her marriage was an absolutely ideal one. When the psychiatrist made only a nonargumentative neutral reply to this statement, she continued her story. She had been married some fifteen to twenty years. She had wanted a child very much, but her husband did not. Of course she did not mind at all, she was sure she did not care whether she had a child. Throughout the last ten years of her marriage, she had had various illnesses which were always diagnosed as nothing wrong-or functional -in character. Five years ago, her husband became impotent-which she",

      "title": "Challenges of Sexuality Expression in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality, although an essential component of human health, remains a controversial topic shrouded in stigma, particularly in the context of neurodiversity, which includes autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where the expression of sexuality presents unique challenges. Autism and sexuality is a complex and multifaceted topic that involves understanding the unique ways in which individuals on the autism spectrum experience and express their sexuality. Objectives The purpose of this work is to address the complexity of the biopsychosocial sexuality components of people with autism, promoting a shift in the medical perspective, societal attitudes, and supporting greater inclusion of these individuals in current discussions regarding this area of human behavior and experience. Methods Evidence-based review, through research conducted on PubMed and selection of the most relevant studies on this topic, published in the last decade. Results Sexuality in autism is now recognized as a normative and integral aspect of development and functioning. Existing research suggests that most individuals with ASD display a clear interest in sexuality and relationships, with a study reviling that 96% of the ASD sample expressed an interest in sexuality. Individuals with high autistic traits tended to identify themselves more times as bisexual or presented a sexuality not definable within the categories of heterosexual. The relationship between autism and gender dysphoria is an area of ongoing research and discussion. Studies have suggested a higher prevalence of gender diverse identities and experiences within the autism community compared to the general population. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increased gender and sexual diversity among individuals with autism. People with ASD may face unique challenges when it comes to their sexuality. The impairments in social skills and communication central to ASD potentially impact an autistic individual’s expression and experience of sexuality by affecting their abilities to understand and interpret social cues, emotions, and nonverbal behaviors of others. Importantly, such individuals may be more vulnerable, as they may have different or even limited understanding of boundaries and consent. To address these challenges, it is important to acknowledge and respect the diversity of sexual experiences and desires among individuals with neuro(bio)logical differences. This can be done by providing accurate and inclusive sex education, creating safe spaces for such individuals to explore and express their sexuality, and working to address discrimination and abuse in intimate contexts. Conclusions Recognizing and respecting this diversity and fostering inclusive and accepting environments, we can help individuals with neurological differences to fully express and explore their sexuality and have satisfying sexual lives.

      "abstract": "At around their third birthday, children begin to enforce social norms on others impersonally, often using generic normative language, but little is known about the developmental building blocks of this abstract norm understanding. Here, we investigate whether even toddlers show signs of enforcing on others interpersonally how “we” do things. In an initial dyad, 18‐month‐old infants learnt a simple game‐like action from an adult. In two experiments, the adult either engaged infants in a normative interactive activity (stressing that this is the way “we” do it) or, as a non‐normative control, marked the same action as idiosyncratic, based on individual preference. In a test dyad, infants had the opportunity to spontaneously intervene when a puppet partner performed an alternative action. Infants intervened, corrected, and directed the puppet more in the normative than in the non‐normative conditions. These findings suggest that, during the second year of life, infants develop second‐personal normative expectations about their partner's behavior (“You should do X!”) in social interactions, thus making an important step toward understanding the normative structure of human cultural activities. These simple normative expectations will later be scaled up to group‐minded and abstract social norms.",

Aberrations at any of the stages of development may thus result in the incomplete or faulty differentiation of the particular component and sexual ambiguity. Ambiguous external genitalia is not a syndrome per se, but manifestation of abnormal development common to many disorders. The occurrence is approximately one in every 30,000 newborns.

Of the various factors believed to be associated with sexual desire, gender (biological sex) is presumed by many theorists to be one of the most important. Limited empirical work suggests that men experience desire more frequently than do women; however, sex differences in intensity or level of desire have yet to be examined. This study explored both the self-reported frequency and intensity of sexual desire among an ethnically diverse sample of 676 men and women. As hypothesized, men reported experiencing a higher overall level of sexual desire than did women. Sex differences also were found with respect to frequency of sexual desire. Men reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and, when asked to estimate the actual frequency with which they experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week). These results do not imply that men always feel desire or that women lack sexual desire. In fact, virtually every participant in this study reported feeling sexual desire on a regular basis. This suggests that desire may be the most universal sexual response experienced by both men and women.",

      "abstract": "The student of human sexual behavior is becoming more interested in the average child as he actually thinks, feels and acts. He is asking for facts directly supplied by children as well as about children. This is in direct contrast to the attitude which existed before the turn of the present century. During the former period the sexual attitudes and sexual awareness of children were referred to in terms of \"degeneracy\" or \"perversion\" or were presented as examples of precocious development of a hypothetic sex instinct. The present day investigator has developed methods for meeting the child on his own level of spontaneous interest in sex and day to day awareness of sexual topics. This has been made possible despite the fact that in present day culture children at an early age become aware that certain topics may not be mentioned, that particular parts of the body may not be",

With eye tracking, 2-month olds' (N = 101; 44 females) social orienting to faces was measured within four-item image arrays. Infants were more likely to detect human faces compared to objects, suggesting a functional face detection system. Unexpectedly, males looked longer at human faces than females, and only males looked faster and longer at human faces compared to objects. Females, in contrast, looked less at human faces relative to animal faces and objects, appearing socially disinterested. Notably, this is the first report of a male face detection advantage at any age. These findings suggest a unique stage in early infant social development.",

      "title": "Lessons Learned from Child Sexual Abuse Research: Prevalence, Outcomes, and Preventive Strategies",
      "abstract": "Until recently, there was much disagreement as to what should be included in the definition of CSA [1]. In some definitions, only contact abuse was included, such as penetration, fondling, kissing, and touching [2]. Noncontact sexual abuse, such as exhibitionism and voyeurism, were not always considered abusive. Nowadays, the field is evolving towards a more inclusive understanding of CSA that is broadly defined as any sexual activity perpetrated against a minor by threat, force, intimidation, or manipulation. The array of sexual activities thus includes fondling, inviting a child to touch or be touched sexually, intercourse, rape, incest, sodomy, exhibitionism, involving a child in prostitution or pornography, or online child luring by cyberpredators [3,4]. CSA experiences vary greatly over multiple dimensions including, but not limited to: duration, frequency, intrusiveness of acts perpetrated, and relationship with perpetrator. Although sexual activity between children has long been thought to be harmless, child on child CSA experiences, such as those involving siblings, is increasingly being recognized as detrimental for the emotional well-being of children as adult on child CSA [5-7]. While adult-to-child interactions in which the purpose is sexual gratification are considered abusive, sexual behaviours between children are less clear-cut as there is no universal definition of sexual abuse that differentiates it from normal sex play and exploration [8]. Although a 2to 5-year age difference between children was first suggested as necessary to consider sexual behaviours between siblings to be incest [9], this criterion is being questioned as studies have shown this age difference to be much lower in many substantiated cases of child-to-child abuse [10]. This formulation of CSA is in keeping with the recommendations from the 1999 World Health Organization Consultation on Child AbusePrevention, where CSA is defined as any activity of a sexual nature 'between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person'. That said, some definitional issues have not yet been resolved in the field. First, much disparity exists regarding age for sexual consent, or age for sexual maturity, which has an influence on the extent to which statutory sex offenses are considered CSA. Sexual activities that involve a person below a statutorily designated age fall under the large umbrella of CSA; however, the age of consent varies greatly across countries, from as young as 12 or 13 (e.g. Tonga, Spain) to 17 or 18 years of age (e.g. some states in the US, Australia). In virtually all European jurisdictions, sexual relations are legal from age 16 onwards, but some countries have set the age for sexual consent at 14 or 15 [11]. In other words, when no coercion or force is used, cases that involve sexual activities between an adult and, for example, a 14-year-old teenager, will be either perceived as a consensual sexual relationship or criminalized and defined as sexual abuse, depending on the legal statutorily designated age of the country where the event occurred. In Canada, a bill was recently adopted to change the age of consent from 14 to 16, a premiere in Canada's history, which emphasizes the impact governmental decisions can have on definitional issues of CSA in societies over time [12]. Second, although coerced sexual activities that occur in dating or romantic relationships is recognized as a form of sexual violence by the World Health Association (see for example a WHO multicountry study from Garcia-Moreno and colleagues [13]), the extent to which this form of interpersonal violence is socially recognized and acknowledged in different legislations around the world is unclear.",

Generally, someone will prepare for retirement only in the financial sector, not in other social aspects. Many of the elderly feel unappreciated and lonely. Situations like this will usually cause stress in the elderly. As a result of stress in general, if it cannot be overcome by the elderly, it can cause the elderly to experience physical decline. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the source of stress in the elderly. This research is descriptive qualitative research because this research presents descriptive data about the factors that cause stress in the elderly. From research conducted, the elderly experience stress due to changes in the way of life they go through. Many routines with excellent physical conditions are a dream for the elderly. Some of the elderly who do not have financial stability still have to carry out their routine activities without being supported by good physical conditions.",

This chapter highlights older men's diverse experiences and attitudes toward sexuality in later life and how these can be understood and translated into improved understanding of their sexual rights. Three ways in which men relate to sexuality in later life are elaborated on in the following: aspirations to continued sexual assertion, potency and performance; renouncing sexuality; and redefining and broadening concepts of sex and sexuality. There are also differences between men with respect to whether the renunciations of sexuality are voluntary and experienced as a freedom or if they were felt as involuntary. Both heterosexual and non-heterosexual men report that sexual interest and desire may decline as one ages. For some heterosexual men, experiences of ageing embodiment, including but not limited to a decline in erectile function, meant an increasing focus on wider pleasures.",

As disfuncoes sexuais femininas podem afetar o desejo sexual e alterar as respostas psicologicas e fisiologicas do corpo frente aos estimulos sexuais, causando sofrimento e insatisfacao nao so na pessoa, como tambem no seu par. Tem como etiologia causas orgânicas, hematologicas, problemas psicologicos e geneticos. Pode ser primaria, com ocorrencia na primeira experiencia sexual ou secundaria, quando ocorre apos previa competencia. O presente estudo tem o objetivo de identificar as principais causas de disfuncoes sexuais na mulher, ampliar os conhecimentos sobre a disfuncao sexual na populacao feminina devido a mesma estar sujeita a fatores que venham interferir no relacionamento, trazendo sofrimento e dificuldade na atividade sexual e que possam vir a afetar diretamente sua vida interpessoal e qualidade de vida, e analisar o papel da assistencia de enfermagem relacionado a disfuncao sexual. Realizou-se um levantamento bibliografico sendo analisados artigos cientificos, periodicos, CAPES, BDENF, e obras literarias no periodo de agosto a novembro de 2013 filtrados pelos indicadores booleanos: saude da mulher e disfuncao sexual ou enfermagem. Verificou-se que os disturbios sexuais sao usualmente diagnosticados quando e parte importante das alteracoes da sexualidade de um individuo. Podem existir por toda a vida, serem adquiridos devido a experiencias de vida ou a patologias clinicas e/ou psiquiatricas. Dificuldades de relacionamento podem levar ao aparecimento de patologias da sexualidade humana e vice-versa. Essas dificuldades podem ou nao desencadear ansiedade na pessoa afetada, dependendo do quadro clinico e da visao que a pessoa possui sobre a importância de sexo em sua vida.. E comum que estas alteracoes sejam escondidas com muito conflito pela pessoa acometida, ocasionando solidao, ansiedade e sintomas de depressao. E importante reconhecer as causas emocionais e psicologicas da disfuncao sexual feminina.

A assistencia de enfermagem e essencial para tratar a mulher com disfuncao sexual, fundamentada de conhecimentos sobre sexualidade tera competencia para realizar educacao sexual nas diferentes etapas do ciclo da vida, em condicoes normais ou patologicas. Conclui-se que para a fundamentacao da assistencia de enfermagem e necessario que o enfermeiro adote uma visao holistica que abrange uma ideia de conjunto, considerando os aspectos psicologicos, sociais, culturais e espirituais, durante todo o cuidar prestado.

      "abstract": "In a context of ageing human population, the question of the elderly people's sexuality, a recent phenomenon, remains without precise and obvious answer. Still, the sexuality of the older person must be viewed as the continuation of the adult's sexuality. However, it is partially or completely, depending on gender, dissociated from the concept of reproduction. Partly for this functional reason, the society estimates that the elderly person cannot feel sexual desire, are not physically attractive, therefore not desirable. Even if they felt sexual need, they would be physiologically unable. Sexuality is an integral part of the quality of life, well-being, and undoubtedly of the person's health whatever their age. It is thus important to deal with this matter from a physiological and biological point of view. Sexuality and deteriorations related to the process of ageing have to be taken into consideration. These deteriorations are not automatically linked to the increase in longevity. It is in the responsibility of health workers, professionally in charge of the elderly people, to help them better understand their desires which lies in a framework of normality. A greater knowledge of their sexuality will fight the current repression of the sexuality of the elder ones.",

      "title": "Hair pulling (trichotillomania).",
      "abstract": "Based on the findings in this case and common elements reported in other articles on trichotillomania, there seems to be evidence that the \"irresistible urge\" to pull out the hair has its beginnings in the early years of a child's life. The nature of the parent-child relationships appears to be especially important in establishing psychological antecedents for the later development of trichotillomania. Specifically, the trichotillomanic's mother sets the stage for the emergence of this symptom by extending the child's dependence upon her as the primary need-gratifier beyond early childhood into latency, adolescence, and adulthood. As a result the child is not gradually propelled to participate in newer and more complex learning experiences that ultimately lead to a sense of mastery and independent functioning in the environment. Important developmental stimuli are not presented at the appropriate times and the child is not exposed to certain types of interactions at the optimal times so that some very important ego functions do not develop, or develop minimally, or in a distorted manner. Simply, the mother cannot \"let go\" of her child, apparently deriving gratification of her own needs through infantilization of the child; as a result the child develops a limited or illusory sense of self sufficiency. Continuation of such an unhealthy symbiotic relationship, however, is found in many forms of psychopathology and the fact that it also underlies trichotillomania may partially account for hair pulling as a symptom associated with such a wide range of nosological categories. It is the main contention of this study, however, that the quality of the parent-child relationships impairs the ego development and causes failure of the trichotillomanic patient to establish object constancy. Without the establishment of object constancy an individual requires visible evidence that the object/person capable of gratifying basic security needs is present or available. In trichotillomania the hair seems to symbolize the need-gratifying object/person who is lost when the hair is pulled out and, more importantly, regained when it is eaten or restored. It appears to be this latter component of trichotillomania, i.e., reincorporation of the need-gratifying object/person, which reassures the patient that infantile needs can be gratified and security can be reestablished. Unfortunately, the trichotillomanic is driven to repeatedly and compulsively remove hair so that it can be regained temporarily since object constancy is never really established.",

The same theme runs through aspects of neonatology and developmental pediatrics—organ systems and processes are laid down early in development and supportive or deleterious factors operating during these early stages can permanently influence or alter the course of development. Belief in \"formative Stages was applied to behavior by Sigmund Freud who emphasized the crucial contribution of early experiences to adult personality. A half century later, the same general principle was used to justify Head Start, an educational program that was supposed to equalize the social classes by providing an intellectual boost to disadvantaged children during their formative years. The principle of \"formative years\" pervaded theory and practice in developmental psychology for decades, but there were always dissonant findings. For example, five decades of research shows quite clearly that test scores obtained within the first year or two of life do not predict later intelligence for normal children.1 Weight and especially skinfold thickness assessed during infancy do not predict later weight or obesity, and early social disadvantage and stress do not necessarily lead to later psychosocial dysfunction. Indeed, today the emphasis in some quarters of developmental psychology is on change, modifiability, and unpredictability in development rather than on consistency.2",

Domestic violence is narrowly defined as an act or threat of violence against someone with whom the perpetrator has a deep relationship. Domestic violence is also closely related to violence against children. While children may not be physically harmed, seeing or hearing their parents being abused can be psychologically devastating. Maturity in Latin verbs is called the term adult or adolescene which means to grow into maturity Adult in Dutch is volwassen which means full and wassen means to grow, so volwassen means that it has fully grown or has finished growing Therefore, adults are individuals who have completed their growth and ready to accept a position in society along with other adults. However, a person's maturity can be disturbed if the child lives in a less harmonious family environment or a broken home, because domestic violence (domestic violence) not only affects the parents but also their children.

It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine self-esteem. Mothers were more important than fathers in the development of chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with decompensation in wives.",

      "abstract": "Female sexuality (meaning sexual desire, excitement and orgasm) has been of considerable interest in psychiatry. Women's efforts to define and legitimize their own experience of their sexuality have increased in the past 25 years. However, the integration of these new views into the body of psychiatric (especially psychoanalytic) theory has not occurred very actively or successfully. Very little is known about the development of sexuality in childhood and adolescence. This paper looks at various behaviours, interests and events in women's lives that might reveal something about the development of their sexuality. The literature on female masturbation is reviewed and some sex differences highlighted. The literature on interest in babies, the wish to have babies, and menarche is explored for possible associations with sexuality. Rather than sexuality being a central organizer of experience, it seems quite possible that experience is an organizer of sexuality. Therefore, to better understand female sexuality we need to consider the impact of experiences during childhood and adolescence.",

Using physical and quantifiable measures are found not useful or accurate reflections of older people's sexuality. A case is made for differentiation as the key to sexual actualization. Further study of differentiated older people is needed to test the initial finding that a segment of the older population has deeply fulfilling, erotic moments with self and/or partner.

      "title": "Sociosexual behavior (nonhuman primates)",
      "abstract": "Sociosexual behavior includes sexual activity not directly related to reproduction. Sociosexuality occurs in primates (prosimians, monkeys, and apes) in many forms including urinary marking, facial expressions, vocalizations, grooming, playing, mounting, and anogenital sniffing, touching, inspecting, and rubbing. Sociosexual behavior takes place between individuals of various combinations of ages and sexes. In some species such as bonobos, sociosexual activity starts in infancy and can occur as many as 30 times a day, while in other species like chimpanzees, it starts later in life and is less frequent. Sociosexual behavior can take the form of sexual competition—competition between members of the same sex for a mate in the form of fighting or even blocking ovulation in less‐dominant individuals. Sociosexuality is interpreted as strengthening relationships, acts of dominance, reparation after fights, and reducing tension. Most data on nonhuman primate sociosexuality indicate that behaviors occurring outside of reproduction may increase future matings and/or reproductive success.",

      "title": "Mental Health Among Sexual Minority Youth",
      "abstract": "The term sexual minority youth (SMY) encompasses youth who are not exclusively heterosexual. These are youth whose sexual orientations, identities, and/or behaviors are not exclusively heterosexual. Sexual identity is one’s personal identity as a sexual being, a label used in regard to oneself, such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “queer,” “pansexual,” or “asexual.”1 Sexual identity may not be indicative of sexual behaviors and, thus, understanding both identity and behavior are essential to providing excellent care— particularly as SMY youth often face health disparities.2 SMY youth, like their heterosexual peers, have strengths and vulnerabilities. Although the majority of sexual minority children and adolescents do well, they are likely to experience mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality at higher rates than their heteronormative peers.1,3 This phenomenon may be due to stigma, microaggressions, victimization, and/or discrimination regarding their sexual identities, which in turn effects overall health.4 In a 2013 survey performed by the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, 55% of sexual and gender minority youth surveyed stated that they felt unsafe at school due to perceived/experienced harassment from peers.5 This harassment can lead to an increase in suicidal ideation and attempts6 due to internalized shame and stigma, social isolation, and conflict about their identities. Microaggressions, stigma, and shame may also be experienced at home and in the community. Healthcare providers are in a unique position to support minority youth across multiple domains if they are aware and informed of social supports and experiences of conflict.",

      "abstract": "Research on human sociality rarely includes kinship, social structure, sex, and familiarity, even though these variables influence sociality in non-human primates. However, cross-cultural ethnographic and observational studies with humans indicate that, beginning after age 5 years, males and females form differing social structures with unrelated individuals in a community. Specifically, compared with females, human males exhibit greater tolerance for and form larger, interconnected groups of peers which we term \"gregariousness.\" To examine sex differences in gregariousness early in life when children first interact with peers without adult supervision, 3- to 6-year-old children were given the choice to enter one of three play areas: an empty one, one with an adult, or one with a familiar, same-sex peer. More males than females initially chose the play area with the same-sex peer, especially after age 5 years. Sex differences in gregariousness with same-sex peers likely constitute one facet of human sociality.",

      "abstract": "Most first-time mothers experience a decline in both their sexual and relationship satisfaction from prepregnancy, which has negative consequences for the couple and their family. Prior studies have begun to identify risk and protective factors (e.g., empathy) for postpartum sexual and relationship satisfaction. Causal attributions for postpartum sexual concerns may be important because a specific cause can be difficult to pinpoint given the wide range of postpartum sexual problems among first-time parents. In the current study, 120 first-time mothers (3–12 months postpartum) completed validated measures assessing attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. Attributions were measured on four dimensions: internal/external (i.e., is the sexual concern due to the self or the situation), stable/unstable (i.e., will the cause of the concern occur again in the future), global/specific (i.e., will the cause of the concern affect other situations), and partner responsibility (i.e., is the partner the cause). When new mothers reported more stable and partner attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, they were less sexually satisfied, and when they attributed greater responsibility for sexual concerns to their partners, they were less satisfied with their overall relationship. These associations remained significant after controlling for potential challenges that may also impact sexual and relationship satisfaction during this period (i.e., breastfeeding, sexual frequency, depressive symptoms, fatigue, sexual functioning). As postpartum sexual concerns are common, attributions for these changes may be a valuable target for interventions aimed at strengthening the intimate relationships of women making the transition to parenthood.",

      "abstract": "1. The functional sexual phases of four species of Pacific coast gastropods with protandric consecutive sexuality have been investigated with regard to the conditions which control the change of sexual phase and particularly with respect to the influence of association or mating on the individual's sexuality. 2. In none of these species nor in six species previously studied is association a prerequisite for the development of the functional male phase, although isolation of these males after a prolonged mating period usually terminates the male phase promptly. 3. In nine of the ten species studied intimate association or permanent mating of the young male with one or more individuals in the female phase tends to accentuate the masculine characteristics and to postpone sexual transformation by prolonging the male phase. In five of these ten species the influence of association is very conspicuous; in four it is apparent but not conspicuous; in only one is the evidence inconclusive. 4. There seems to be no evidence that the accentuation and prolongation of the male phase by association is due to any masculinizing chemical secretion or hormone which passes through the water from the body of the female to that of the male, as some investigators have assumed; it seems more probable that stimuli received by the male through the sense organs in his penis and tentacles during association with the female are of such a nature as to influence his masculine characteristics, presumably by the mediation of hormones secreted within his own body. 5. Sexual maturity and sexual metamorphosis in these mollusks, like other types of metamorphosis in animals, are subject to environmental influences and can be accelerated, postponed or inhibited experimentally, but the sequence of sexual phases cannot be reversed.",

      "abstract": "A healthy sexual life begins in childhood, and the groundwork for later difficulties also begins in childhood. For the child, sexuality is a rather general, pleasurable excitation, not a specific genital stimulation. Excessive attention to the perineal area, operation upon or injury to the genital area and injections are vicissitudes which may have an unhealthy influence on later sexual development. Healthy and informed parental attitudes are the key here, just as they are in the normal exhibitionism, curiosity and intense emotional attachments to parents. Parents infect children, healthily or unhealthily, with their attitudes. In healthy growth exhibitionism and peeping become transformed in socially acceptable ways. In unhealthy growth, either perversions or strong reactions like over-modesty or shame result. Masturbation is common and transitory in most children. Parents, and especially pediatricians to whom parents turn, have a golden opportunity to direct healthy growth by being well informed about the infant and child's sexual growth and thus be enabled to advise upon or manage the common developmental phenomena with good commonsense and patience. Infants and children do not enter the world possessing the morals, standards or inhibitions of adults.",

But childhood, although it is influential, does not finally determine the personality characteristics of the adult individual. This is evident from the fact that people who have very similar childhood experiences often exhibit very different personality traits in their adult activities and relationships. Psychoanalytic theories of childhood, especially where they place emphasis on the long-term effects of unresolved unconscious conflicts at oral, anal or genital stages of development, often appear to be highly determinist, not to say pessimistic, concerning the influence of childhood on the adult.",

      "title": "Early life maternal sociality predicts juvenile sociality in blue monkeys",
      "abstract": "Abstract Maternal effects are widespread in living organisms though little is known about whether they shape individual affiliative social behavior in primates. Further, it remains a question whether maternal effects on affiliative behavior differ by offspring sex, as they do in other physiological systems, especially in species with high levels of adult sexual dimorphism and divergence in social niches. We explored how direct and indirect experiences of maternal affiliative behavior during infancy predicted affiliative behavior approximately 1–6 years later during the juvenile period, using behavioral data from 41 wild blue monkey juveniles and their 29 mothers, and controlling for individual age, sex, and maternal rank. Female juveniles spent less time grooming with any partner and with peers the more maternal grooming they received during infancy, whereas males groomed more with any partner and with peers. Similarly, the more that mothers groomed with other adult females during subjects’ infancy, female subjects played less with peers, and male subjects played more as juveniles. Further, this maternal effect on social behavior appears specific to early life, as the same aspects of mothers’ sociality measured throughout subjects’ development did not predict juvenile behavior. Overall, our results suggest that both direct and indirect experience of mother's affiliative behavior during infancy influence an individual's affiliation later in life that sexes respond differently to the maternal affiliation, and that the first year of life is a critical window.",

Common milestones measured in the 30 studies reviewed were becoming aware of queer attractions, questioning one’s sexual orientation, self-identifying as LGB+, coming out to others, engaging in sexual activity, and initiating a romantic relationship. Milestones occurred in different sequences, although attraction was almost always first, often followed by self-identification and/or sexual activity; coming out and initiating a romantic relationship often followed these milestones. Meta-analysis results showed that the mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals varied by milestone: attraction [ M age =12.7 (10.1, 15.3)], questioning one’s orientation [ M age =13.2 [12.8, 13.6]), self-identifying [ M age =17.8 (11.6, 24.0)], sexual activity [ M age =18.1 (17.6, 18.6)], coming out [ M age =19.6 (17.2, 22.0)], and romantic relationship [ M age =20.9 (13.2, 28.6)]. Nonetheless, results also showed substantial heterogeneity in the mean effect sizes. Additional meta-analyses showed that milestone timing varied by sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort. Although patterns were found in LGB+ identity development, there was considerable diversity in milestone trajectories.",

      "abstract": "Past research suggests that heterosexual men show a category-specific pattern of sexual arousal, showing greater arousal to stimuli depicting women than those depicting men.Gender is not, however, the only factor affecting sexual arousal in men. Research has shown that men regard relationship context as an important factor in sexual arousal.Additionally, men show greater sexual arousal to novel than to familiar sexual stimuli. Sociosexuality, the preference for committed or uncommitted sexual relationships,affects behaviour and partner preferences. The current study investigates the relationship between sociosexuality, gender cues, relationship context cues, and sexual arousal in menby assessing 25 heterosexual men’s genital and subjective sexual arousal to 18 audio narratives describing sexual or neutral encounters with female and male strangers,friends, or long-term relationship partners. I expect that heterosexual men will show greater subjective and genital arousal in response to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a woman than to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a man, replicating previous research. I hypothesize that there will be an interaction between gender cues and relationship context, such that men will show greater sexual arousal to stimuli depicting novel female sexual partners (strangers and friends) than to stimuli depicting familiar female sexual partners (long-term partners). I predict that higher sociosexuality scores, indicating a greater preference for uncommitted sexual relationships, will correlate with greater sexual arousal to uncommitted relationship contexts (strangers or friends), whereas lower sociosexuality scores, will correspond with greater sexual arousal to the committed relationship context (long-term partner).",

      "abstract": "A child subjected to sexual abuse will react differently than an adult would. We will come back to the reasons why. In addition to these characteristics inherent to the child, many other factors make the handling of the situation difficult and unusual. The consequences of child abuse, whether visible or not, do indeed unquestionably alter the child's cognitive schemes and the relationships he will built in the future. Do these factors, inherent to the child or to the abusive relationship, always influence the immediate outcome, the followup and the psychological future of these young victims of sexual abuse?",

If a person is incapable of consenting because they are temporarily non-autonomous – as in the case of an intoxicated adult or a pre-autonomous child – the infringement should be delayed until the individual becomes autonomous and can make their own decision. Given the seriousness of violating anyone's right to BI, and especially that of the most vulnerable persons, the appropriate likelihood-of-consent for proceeding with a BI infringement on a child is argued to be at or near the 'medically necessary' threshold. Depending on what the proposed BI infringement is, then, children will sometimes be able to consent – or withhold their consent – to a proposed alteration of their bodies in a way that is appropriate for their developmental stage.",

      "abstract": "level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity. This content downloaded from 157.55.39.235 on Fri, 07 Oct 2016 06:09:55 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Early Influences on Development A second major self-righting tendency might be found at the societal level. To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.",

      "abstract": "In this paper I want to address the question of what it means to be a sexual subject, primarily as a matter of theory, but always keeping in mind the implications of that project for a set of material parameters that concern the notion of human flourishing. Given that for any postmodernist analysis the complex issue of sexual subjectivity is always open to question and uncertainty, then to read the specific problematic, as I intend, through the field of disability, where sexuality has scarcely been theorised at all, is even more troubling. The widespread western uneasiness in acknowledging or even recognising erotic desire, an uneasiness that can be seen at play in the attempted effacement of childhood sexuality, or in the consignment of older people to a sexual limbo, is most clearly mobilised where the form of embodiment itself contests, either deliberatively or accidentally, the standards of normative corporeality. Whether the body in question has been intentionally transformed as in transsexual surgery or enhanced by body-building drug regimes, or has suffered severe trauma such as amputation or spinal injury, then the attributions of sexual desire and practice are likely to invoke discomfort and confusion. Even more disturbing, however, to the point of denial of any sexuality at all are those modes of embodiment that are both radically anomalous and resistant either projectively or retrospectively to normative recuperation. The category of congenital or early onset disability is surely paradigmatic in that its exclusion from the very notion of sexual subjectivity is so unproblematised that it is taken almost as a natural fact. It is not necessary to re-essentialise sexuality, however, in order to contest the exclusionary violence of such a view. Following the phenomenological path taken by Foucault and Butler, it?s clear that what is at stake lies in the performitivity of sexuality, not as a potentially pleasurable bonus, but as a core element of self-becoming that infuses all aspects of the materiality of living in the world. As Merleau-Ponty (1963) suggests, sexuality is, quite simply, a modality of existence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract First sexual intercourse is often viewed as a rite of passage to adulthood. While one's initial coital experience may lead to affirmation of self identity, it is disappointing for many, resulting an feelings of guilt and shame. If guilt feelings do emerge, the likelihood of future sexual dissatisfaction is greatly increased. In particular, women with high leuels of sexual guilttend to perceive less sexual arousal, resulting in less enjoyment from their sexual encounters. The purposes of this investigation were to identify those factors crrelated with feeling guilty about first sexual intercourse and to examine the injuence of guilt about first intercourse on current sexual satisfaction. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to never–married collegewomen, with the subsample for this investigation consisting of 570 women. Significant variables correlated with guilt at first sexual intercourse include uncommunicative mother and father figures, overstrict father figures, uncomfortabkness with sexuality, physiological and psychologzcalsexual dissatisfaction with first intercourse, guilt feelings about current intercourse, and psychological sexual dissatisfaction. These findings have substantial implications for sex researchers, sex therapists, family therapists, and sexuality educators who wish to promote healthy sexuality, through both attitudes and behavior.",

      "abstract": "To date, the body image literature has largely ignored older men, as the bulk of the research has focused on young and middle-aged women. Where studies have been conducted with older men, they have tended to only consider the perspectives of men in their 50s and 60s or to include older men as part of mixed gender or diverse age samples. Thus, little is known about how older men perceive, experience, and feel about their aging and changing bodies, even as the body is central to older men’s understanding and practice of masculinity as well as their position in age- and gender-based systems of inequality. Addressing this gap in the research, we conducted in-depth interviews with 22 community-dwelling men aged 67–90 years (average age of 77 years). Drawing upon age relations and masculinities theorizing, we asked the men about how they evaluated and felt about their appearances, health, physical abilities, and sexual functioning. Our thematic analysis revealed that the men were largely satisfied with their appearances and physical functioning, particularly their approximation to masculine ideals of youthfulness, healthiness, and independence. Whereas half of the men identified their weight as a source of body satisfaction, all of the men disparaged obesity and stereotypical older men’s enlarged stomachs in particular. That said, the men discounted appearance as an unimportant and feminized concern. In contrast, they emphasized the salience of health and body functionality, expressing concern about how changes to their physical abilities and sexual functioning had already affected, and might in the future increasingly delimit, their daily lives, and hence they preferred social and physical pursuits. We consider our findings in light of age and masculinity ideals, which collectively privilege youthful bodies and subordinate older men.",

Child abuse can be identified by different signs.\r\nPsysical abuse has clear consequences and if we observe child psysical abuse should be the easiest to identify. Psysical abuse includes hitting, pushing, causing pain, physical restraint, shaking, tightening, biting, scalding, etc. Emotional abuse dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child. Indicators of emotional abuse can be the child's fearfulness, tics, stuttering, insecurity, etc... Sexual abuse includes kissing, touching genitals or breasts, sexual intercourse, oral and anal contact, viewing and showing pornographic magazines and films or other pornographic material.

      "title": "Sexuality and couple intimacy in dementia",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review The review assesses recent research and its impact on understanding of intimacy and sexuality in older adults with dementia. Recent findings There is no universally accepted definition of inappropriate sexual behaviors (ISBs), but they have been divided into overt acts associated with increased libido and uninhibited sexual behaviors directed at oneself or other people. Couples affected by dementia frequently maintain physical intimacy. Nonintercourse intimate activities may be preferred over intercourse. Early therapeutic interventions may assist partners in modifying activities, behaviors, and expectations about the future of the relationship. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are commonly due to the disruption of interconnected brain structures. Trauma to the temporal lobes may lead to hypersexuality and ISB. Trauma to the limbic system can produce changes in sexual preference. Both temporal and frontotemporal dementias, or either of them, often present with socially and sexually inappropriate behaviors. Huntington's disease can exhibit hypersexuality, pedophilia, promiscuity, and marital infidelity. The involvement of the medial striatum of the basal ganglia in this disease explains the prevalence of ISB. There is no consensus regarding first-line pharmacotherapy for ISB. Little information is known about the adverse effects. Summary Clinicians and society need to consider how dementia might affect physical intimacy.",

In some cases a psychophysiological method, the phallometric test of sexual object preference, was also applied. There was no indication in the results that the gross sexual deviations of narcissism or masochism, or aversion to their own penis played a major part in the syndrome. The trans-sexual males preferred physically mature male partners, i.e., they were androphilic, they preferred these partners to be heterosexual, and they indicated an earlier onset of exclusively homosexual interest and less heterosexual experience than nontrans-sexual androphilic males.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A QUESTION OF REPRODUCTION is usually an academic matter in individuals with a cytogenetically detectable functional autosomal aneuploidy. But toward the milder end of the phenotypic range, social and emotional development may be such that forming a stable relationship is possible. Some who lack that degree of maturity may yet have a social freedom that opens the possibility of a sexual encounter. Either on their own behalf, or through the agency of parents or other carers (whose agenda may include sterilization), such people may present to the genetic clinic. Ethical issues raised in this context are aired in Chapter 1. With some of the deletions and duplications of lesser genetic imbalance revealed by molecular techniques, the phenotypic effects may be very mild, with social and intellectual functioning well within the normal range.The mosaic state may on occasion be associated with an apparently normal phenotype, or at least very close to normal. Some of these persons will have been identified by their having had a child with the imbalance for which they themselves have a low-level mosaicism. Some present with infertility. The theoretical risk will depend upon the extent to which the gonad carries the aneuploid line.In contrast, some structural imbalances are without discernible phenotypic effect. Deletion or duplication of a small segment of euchromatin, or the presence of a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC), is occasionally recognized fortuitously in normal and fertile individuals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disorders of sex development (DSD) are relatively rare conditions with diverse pathophysiology, which usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. These conditions are very heterogeneous and can present in a variety of different ways, most commonly with ambiguous genitalia noticed in the newborn period or delayed puberty in adolescents. The impact of these disorders on the lives of these patients and their families should not be underestimated. These clinical situations can often be difficult to manage, particularly in those cases where the sex of rearing is uncertain. The needs of each individual patient presenting with DSD conditions must be fully considered, along with the needs of their families and where appropriate, cultural practices. The multidisciplinary team should be involved from early in the diagnosis and ethical principles must be considered at all stages of management of the condition. Key Concepts: Disorders of sex development usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. There are three broad groups of DSD: sex chromosome DSD; 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD. Where there is uncertainty about the sex of a patient, sex assignment should be delayed until appropriate investigations have been carried out. A multidisciplinary team should be involved from an early stage. The psychosocial implications of a diagnosis of DSD must be considered for the family and the patient.",

      "abstract": "\"A woman's sex life ends with the menopause; Sex is for the young, I'm too old to bother with all that; older people are asexual.\" \"Later life sexuality in women is about words, images, ritual and fantasy as it is about the body\" Sexuality in older adults especially the sexual behavior of older women has been shrouded in discreet silence distaste and ignorance (Oppenheimer 2002).1 Recent literature however has demythologised sexuality and revealed that men and women continue to be sexually active well into old age. A recent study from US reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (Lindau et al. 2007)2 reports that 73% of those 57-64 age, 53% of those 65-74 years of age and 26% of those 74-85 years of age reported to being sexually active (defined as any mutually voluntary activity with another person that involves sexual contact, whether or not intercourse or orgasm occurs). In all groups, sexual activity for men was higher. It is interesting that 35% of all women and 13% of all men interviewed said \"sex was not at all important\". It is recognized that leading an active and fulfilling sexual life is related to physical health, ability to function sexually, availability of a partner and perceptions of self esteem and body image (Lindau 2007; Clarke 2006).2,3 Overlying all of these is the personal knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the role of sexuality and sexual behaviors in wellbeing. With the 'Baby Boomer' generation coming of age as 'Older Adults', this presentation will explore whether the discourses of positive ageing have created the sexy ageless consumer as a personally and socially responsible citizen. Is the availability and apparent popularity of adult on-line dating for relationships; gyms and health fads for the healthy body; drugs and devices (sex toys such as the Eros clitoral device, and ben-wa balls); cosmetic treatments (Clarke 2006)3 and now surgical procedures for the body beautiful (Goodman et al. 2007)4 indicative of a need for assistance in sexuality? Or a use of the 'Baby Boomer' demographic bulge in the population as a marketing target?",

The intimate reciprocal relations of the brain, or cerebral centers, and the prostate gland are marked, both in health and in disease. In health, excessive mental taxation, as by study or business cares, will lessen the sexual appetite; while violent emotions, such as grief, fright or anxiety, will temporarily suspend all desire.

Loneliness, isolation, loss of former friendships, and ostracism by former intimate friends were some of the perceptions of the widows. Sexual problems, especially frustration, were evident among many widows. Adaptation to sexual frustration included sexual affairs with men who would not ordinarily be considered a partner, such as the married or one's physician. All widows reported that the sexual relationship was salubrious, which has implications for counselors and therapists comforting the widowed or providing death education. Each widow's individual personality and life events affected coping. Increased mental and physical ailments after the death of their spouse, especially in the first year of bereavement were reported by 15 of the 18 widows.",

The aim of the present review is the theoretical approach, both of the changes that take place in the physiology of sexual function of elderly people and of the factors and situations that are blamed for the occurrence of these dysfunctions. For the writing of this review, a systematic approach was used to search and identify all recently published literature (articles, studies and reviews) related το the factors that cause Sexual Dysfunctions in Elderly, through the scientific databases Pub Med, Academia.Edu, Research Gate. Pathophysiological and anatomical changes, organic and psychological problems, which occur over time, negatively affect the frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual desire and in general the sexuality of older people. Older men, on the one hand, have mainly problems with erectile dysfunction, problematic ejaculation and decreased sexual desire, while women, on the other hand, mainly due to menopause, which causes hormonal, physical and mental changes, mainly show reduced sexual desire and stimulation, insufficiency of vaginal lubrication and dyspareunia. Older people have a variety of health problems that have a negative effect on their sexual activity, while each gender is faced with specific problems, medical, pharmaceutical and psychosocial reasons, which negatively affect their sex life",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human females exhibit greater social interest and skills relative to males, appearing in infancy, suggesting biological roots; however, male and female infants may be treated differently, potentially causing or amplifying sex differences. Here, we tested whether sex differences in social motivation emerge in infant monkeys ( n = 48) reared in a controlled postnatal environment. Compared to males, females at 2–3 weeks looked more at conspecifics’ faces ( d = 0.65), especially the eyes ( d = 1.09) and at 4–5 weeks exhibited more affiliative behaviors ( d = 0.64), including gesturing, looking and proximity to familiar and unfamiliar human caretakers. In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience. Individual differences in social interest have wide-ranging developmental consequences, impacting infants’ social interaction quality and opportunities for learning. Understanding the evolution of sex differences and their developmental emergence is necessary to best support infants with varying levels of sociality.",

According to the results of the factor analysis, the determining features of the axio-psychological design of the life achievements of the individual in the period of early adulthood of the female gender were determined, represented by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: disposition of self-efficacy, disposition of perfectionism, attribution of responsibility, overcoming obstacles, use of unproductive coping, \"futile efforts\", combination of androgyny with femininity, benevolence, desire for success, lack of adequate mental age assessment. Instead, representatives of the male gender of early adulthood are distinguished by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: traits of the male gender in achieving success, overcoming obstacles, helplessness, lack of externally regulated perfectionism, failure, lack of independence as a lack of result, understanding of the situation, reward for what has been achieved, duality of externally regulated perfectionism , affective-conative complex. Gender-based differences between the factors of axio-psychological projection in early adulthood have been revealed: in women, this process is motivated by the disposition of self-efficacy and perfectionist guidelines, and in men by masculinity traits and the desire to overcome obstacles.",

Stigma discrimination and the violation of human rights are intimately connected reinforcing and legitimising each other. Their manifestations are varied occurring in families and communities in health services at places of work and in schools. Across a range of settings young people may be stigmatised and discriminated against for being sexually active before marriage or for engaging in forms of sexuality which are considered by their communities and wider society to be non-normative such as homosexual or transgendered practices. In addition in settings where premarital sexual activity among young people is stigmatised the signs of unprotected sexual activity such as unplanned pregnancy having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or being HIV-positive may themselves be highly stigmatised. This may seriously limit access to good quality sexual and reproductive health services. This stigmatisation of young people’s sexuality and sexual behaviour has serious consequences. In particular it can lead to young people feeling that they have to conceal their sexual activity from significant adults in their lives including parents teachers and health workers. The secrecy and shame that stigma often brings can deny young people access to the resources they need in order to make and implement informed decisions about their sexuality and sexual health. Where resources are available - or inappropriately framed - they may be inadequate to address young people’s needs. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "Four studies investigated children's explanations for family resemblance and species-typical characteristics, under different conditions of biological parentage and rearing environment. Participating were 226 children between 3 and 11 years. Children Children were presented with a number of different tasks, some involving people and some domestic animals. Each task involved interviews in which children predicted what kinds, of physical and behavioral characteristics offspring would be most likely to demonstrate under normal biological parentage and rearing, adoptive rearing, inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with own species, or inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with transplant species. In all studies, particularly those involving non-human animals, there was a strong tendency for children of all ages to draw on essentialist explanations for their predictions. Among the youngest children (3-4 year olds), psychological intentional explanations were common. It was not until 6 to 7 years that explanations clearly began to refer to physical processes and putative biological mechanisms. The period between 4 and 6 years appeared to be a transitional phase where performance and explanations were more variable and seemed to be highly task-dependent. Biological-based, although often inaccurate, explanations for inheritance increased dramatically around 10 to 11 years. (Contains 11 references.)

Sexual dysfunction is common and increases with age and pelvic floor disorders such as urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Surgical treatment of pelvic floor disorders has been poorly studied but has the potential to improve sexual satisfaction or to cause sexual difficulties. New instruments such as condition-specific sexual questionnaires have recently been developed and will help us to better evaluate the results of incontinence and prolapse surgery on sexual function.",

      "title": "Control of age at menarche.",
      "abstract": "The menarche stands as our primary indicator of onset of sexual maturity in females. The age at which this milestone occurs has therefore become one of major parameters of maturation rates among individuals, or among groups, and wide range of variation in age at menarche makes it a useful parameter. The factors which operate to create variability in menarcheal age are many, and involve hereditary and environmental determinants. Their interactions are quite complex and any attempt to isolate significant associations must adopt a multifactorial design. Only in this way will nature of determining factors, particularly those associated with external environment, be discovered. Of all developmental milestones associated with adolescent years, menarche, by all odds, is most noteworthy. To researcher in child development, concerned parent, or growing child, onset of first menstrual period is a qualitative event of major significance, denoting achievement of a functional state which involves, if not ability to regularly conceive, at least hypothalamic control of ovarian cycle via pituitary gland. Although not every segment of society would view this phenomenon in such glowing physiological terms, to student of human development, connotation of sexual maturity and entry into a new set of biosocial interactions is unmistakable. Since virtually beginning of scientific study of child development, researchers have included recording of age at menarche among data obtained, although why has not always been apparent. Menarche does not indicate a functional reproductive system, anovular cycles being the rule rather than exception during adolescence (Israel, 1967). Menarche does not signal onset of growth spurt since major portion of adolescent growth has passed, by initiation of a menstrual cycle (Tanner, 1962). And, since there 1 Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104.

Johnston is no presently-recognized phenomenon of comparable significance among males, utility of any set of observations regarding its occurrence is restricted to females. Nonetheless, despite foregoing, we have, and shall continue, to obtain, analyze, and report on ages at menarche among those samples which we study. After all, it is a qualitative event and one which is easily recordable, if simple methodological considerations are followed. In addition, age at menarche is correlated with most of other events and processes of adolescence. While some individuals may reject notion that maturation process proceeds as a unit ( Brown, 1966), others have pointed out many associations among measures of maturation (Boas, 1932; Shuttleworth, 1937, 1949; Tanner, 1962), so that age at menarche does become a very useful parameter. And finally, age at menarche among individual girls shows a remarkable range of variation. The earliest menarche yet recorded, reputedly in absence of endocrine tumors, central nervous system lesions, and like, occurred in a girl of 9 Уг months of age (Masterson, 1967), and idiopathic delays of puberty have been associated with menarcheal ages of 20 years or more. Among most samples, standard deviation of age at menarche is about ±2 years. Among samples of populations from around world, an equally striking range of variation exists in mean ages at menarche reported in literature. The earliest mean ages approach 12.3 years (Tanner, 1962; Hiernaux, 1968) and current upper end of range is to be found among Bundi of New Guinea highlands, whose average age at first menstruation is given as 18.8 years (Malcolm, 1966). Given a discrete event that shows such sensitivity to appropriate determinants, and such strong associations with other events, it is no wonder that an almost innumerable number of studies have appeared on subject. However, in view of wide variation in ages at menarche, and correlation of these ages with so many factors, truly analytic studies require a fair amount of sophistication in design in order to disentangle these factors. Unfortunately, designs of this sort are too often lacking in published literature so that we are, more often than not, left with papers which provide us only with answers in search of questions. Lest we be left with cavalier attitude that it is a simple matter to obtain menarcheal ages in a sample of females, even assuming that question may be asked and answered, let me note that recording errors may not only be quite large, but systematic as well. Recall data This content downloaded from 207.46.13.51 on Tue, 21 Jun 2016 06:04:58 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Control of Age at Menarche 161 are frequently incorrect due to fickle nature of our memories, and bias may be introduced by possibility that women whose menarcheal ages were later than average tend to display errors in memory which are less than those menstruating early. The most accurate way is to fit a probit line to yes-or-no distributions, by age, after assuring that age range is sufficient to catch very late maturers (Tanner, 1962). What, then, does regulate and control age at menarche in adolescent females, excluding direct hormonal influences? Unfortunately, answer seems to be everything. For, if one consistent conclusion is to be drawn from mass of studies on subject, it seems to be that, if two groups of females are contrasted in some way, their mean ages at menarche will probably differ. It is my purpose here to point out some_of most frequently reported and also some of most intriguing associations which may be noted so that truly multivariate control, if we may use such a word, may become more apparent. First of all, there are those associations which occur with other aspects of development such that they are consistent covariates of menarcheal age. Thus, age at menarche is correlated with other general measures of degree of biological maturation and growth timing. Nicolson and Hanley, in 1958, reported correlations between age at menarche and measures of development of secondary sex characteristics which ranged from 0.58 to 0.86 ( Nicolson and Hanley, 1958) . Earlier Simmons and Greulich (1943) and Shuttleworth (1949) analyzed much of existing data and recently Marshall and Tanner (1969) have reported on longitudinal study of children from National Children's Home in Harpenden, England. All reached generally similar conclusions: that age at menarche shows a high and positive correlation with other measures of maturation rate (Table 1). This relationship to a wide range of biological indicators is seen also in greater accuracy of skeletal age than chronological age in predicting occurrence of first menstruation (Simmons and Greulich, 1943; Andersen, 1968). Likewise, earlier menarche is associated with fatness in adolescent females (Bruch, 1941; Reynolds, 1951; Garn and Haskell, 1960; Hammar et al. 1972). For 200 females diagnosed as being clinically obese, Bruch, for example, noted that this advancement may be as much as IVz years. In fact, only samples whose mean ages at menarche are less than 12.0 years of age are study samples composed of obese females. Physique is another feature associated with menarcheal age, as Tanner (1962) has summarized.

      "title": "Approach to the Patient: Transgender Youth: Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Compelling studies have demonstrated that \"gender identity\"--a person's inner sense of self as male, female, or occasionally a category other than male or female--is not simply a psychosocial construct, but likely reflects a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. An increasing number of preadolescents and adolescents, identifying as \"transgender\" (a transient or persistent identification with a gender different from their \"natal gender\"--ie, the gender that is assumed based on the physical sex characteristics present at birth), are seeking medical services to enable the development of physical characteristics consistent with their affirmed gender. Such services, including the use of agents to block endogenous puberty at Tanner stage 2 and subsequent use of cross-sex hormones, are based on longitudinal studies demonstrating that those individuals who were first identified as gender-dysphoric in early or middle childhood and who still meet the mental health criteria for being transgender at early puberty are likely to be transgender as adults. Furthermore, onset of puberty in transgender youth is often accompanied by increased \"gender dysphoria\"--clinically significant distress related to the incongruence between one's affirmed gender and one's \"assigned (or natal) gender.\" Studies have shown that such distress may be ameliorated by a \"gender-affirming\" model of care. Although endocrinologists are familiar with concerns surrounding gender identity in patients with disorders of sex development, many providers are unfamiliar with the approach to the evaluation and management of transgender youth without a disorder of sex development. The goals of this article are to review studies that shed light on the biological underpinnings of gender identity, the epidemiology and natural history of transgenderism, current clinical practice guidelines for transgender youth, and limitations and challenges to optimal care. Prospective cohort studies focused on long-term safety and efficacy are needed to optimize medical and mental health care for transgender youth.",

Multiple psychological and behavioural symptoms of sexual violence have been described by various authors. These include excessive eroticisation of the child. Such abused children often display provocative and seductive sexual behaviour. Parents or guardians report depressed mood or anxiety in the child. Young victims of sexual offenses usually experience psychosexual problems and have low self-esteem, also in adulthood. Furthermore, masturbation inadequate for the stage of psychosexual development is another symptom, which was discussed in the historical context of sexual deviations involving children. There is full consensus in terms of sexology, sexual ethics and other sciences as well as strong social condemnation of sexual violence against children: the perpetrators are dangerous criminals, who sometimes try to justify their pathological sexual activity by describing it as ‘a harmless weakness of the elite which is rooted in antiquity’. However, this type of child abuse cannot be justified in any way.",

      "abstract": "In the period of development of boys, the years immediately preceding puberty are of especial interest. By this time the figure has lost most of its childish characteristics and the mind has reached a point of great intelligence. Although the individual has scarcely passed the half-way mark in the years of growth, and has only attained half his future weight, yet he resembles the adult much more than he resembles the infant. At this stage the sex glands have not yet begun the rapid development of puberty with its profound effect on the whole organism. Curiously enough there is a sudden increase in the rate of growth which takes place at this time. In fact, we may consider boys in the period of prepubescence as individuals of adult form but of small size, growing rapidly, and as yet scarcely influenced by the internal secretions of the sex glands.",

Deterrents to sexual activity may include society's disapproval of sexual expression by the elderly, lack of a partner, the elderly person's own lack of sexual knowledge or belief that nonreproductive sexuality is wrong, and lack of privacy. Physicians must accept elderly people's sexuality and develop attitudes and skills which facilitate communication. It is particularly important to make elderly patients aware that they do not have to have intercourse in order to express their sexuality, and to educate them about the physiological and pathological changes with aging, so they realize these changes need not mean the end of sexual expression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For men in general, there are a variety of reasons for impaired sexual performance, including depression, anxiety, and medications. For men with PD, additional factors may play a role. Let’s think about this in more detail. Impotence implies difficulty with sexual performance—problems achieving and maintaining an erection, which should lead to ejaculation. Before considering all the things that can disrupt sexual performance, we should recognize that occasional impotence is common. This is something that can and does happen to even the most macho guy. Men are at their sexual peak during their teenage years and a little after. With passing decades, not only does the urge for sexual gratification decline but also the ability to perform. Hence, as men pass beyond the years when all they think about is sex, occasional impotence is fairly common. We need to accept this, just as we are stuck with the joint pains that never bothered us when we were young, or the middle-age requirement for reading glasses.",

      "abstract": "In adolescence, the system of values, the ways to find pleasure, the experience of being loved, being a male or a female, are put to the test due to the presence of sexually mature body. In many cases, what goes relatively smoothly in normal development can be stressful for some adolescents. Despite that, adolescents find ways to respond and to use their experiences constructively, in an effort and with a desire to enter the social and sexual world of adults. Still, there are adolescents whose experiences are completely different and whose adolescence is riddled with problems. They live haunted by their own fantasies and no matter how much they try to keep the cause of suffering or hatred outside themselves, they inevitably face the experience of their bodies being the source of abnormality and of not being able to do much else but giving in to illness. Crucial change that should take place in adolescence for an individual to reach psychic maturity is the weakening of relations with primary objects, which enables the creation of new object relations. In self-harming adolescents, however, there is inability to give up the bond with the mother - any internal attempt to break this bond brings the feeling of unbearable loss. Basically, the adolescent's relationship with their mother is highly ambivalent, and the feelings fluctuate from intense hatred to intense love. Careful monitoring brings up the conclusion that these are narcissistic personalities with primitive and punishing superego. In this article, we have used the psychoanalytic theoretical concepts as a basis for understanding the psychopathology and psychodynamics of adolescents whose act of intentional and conscious attacking of one's own body is one of the main reasons for seeking psychiatric help, which will be illustrated by presenting individual and milieu therapy of an adolescent girl treated at the Day Hospital for Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health.",

Lack of appropriate chores, decreased opportunities to interact and compete with peers, plus uncertainties to interact and compete with peers, plus uncertainties about bowel and bladder continence appear to be the greatest impediments to emotional growth in this physically handicapped group of teenagers.

Just prior to puberty, the sensitivity of the gonadostat to the negative feedback of gonadal sex steroids decreases, releasing the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) from inhibition. Puberty is heralded by the myriad of physical changes that occur in the body with the advent of the hormonally mediated effects and the cognitive shift associated with them. With both the psychological and biological maturity of adolescence come issues of separation and individuation, consolidation of a sense of self, development of a sexual identity and progress toward academic and vocational plans for adult life. The most useful framework for the discussion is the biopsychosocial model, which has also been used successfully in so many other domains. Throughout adolescence, the work of development that was made possible by the physical, cognitive and psychological changes induced by puberty continues unabated.",

Holistic care for persons with disabilities means the rehabilitation nurse intervenes when problems of sexual function are discovered, observed, or expressed. However, most people with chronic illnesses and disabilities must confront prevalent myths about their sexual nature and abilities. These myths often have their basis in the notion, common in our society, that the only people who are sexual are those who are young and beautiful. People who are obese, old, or do not conform to current standards of sexual attractiveness are usually deemed as asexual or undesirable. These narrow sterotypes have been particularly damaging to physically or mentally disabled people. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities often have special needs regarding their sexual behavior. Most of us will confront chronic illness or disability in our own lives to some degree. In addition, illnss or disability can occur at any age. In this study, I discuss some of the special needs of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities and the methods of coping with those needs. I also discuss some of the sexual concerns that people with chronic illnesses and disabilities have in common, and the assessment of sexual function and nursing strategies through literature review.",

      "title": "Moments of Pleasure: A Preliminary Classification of Gustatory mmms and the Enactment of Enjoyment During Infant Mealtimes",
      "abstract": "The enjoyment of food and the sharing of mealtimes is a normative cultural and social practice. Empirical research on eating enjoyment has, however, been a rather neglected area across the social sciences, often marginalized in favor of health or focusing on individual preferences rather than shared enjoyment. Even with regards to children, their enjoyment of food is typically rated retrospectively via parental reports of mealtime behavior. What is missing is an understanding of how enjoyment becomes a normative, cultural practice during mealtimes. This paper examines this issue in the context of parents feeding their five- to eight-month-old infants in the family home, since it is within this context that we can see the early emergence of normative practices in often highly routinized situations. The enactment of eating as enjoyable, and of the food as appreciated or 'liked' in some way, is a culturally normative practice that becomes recognizable through particular non-lexical ('mmm', 'ooh') or lexical ('this is nice, isn't it?') utterances. The data comprise 66 infant mealtimes video-recorded over almost 19 hours, from five families living in Scotland. The analysis uses discursive psychology and focuses on the sequential position of different types of parental gustatory mmms as produced during the infant meals. A classification of four types of mmm were identified in the corpus – announcement, receipting, modelling and encouragement mmms - each associated with features of sequential and multimodal organization within the mealtime. In the majority of instances, mmms were uttered alone with no other assessment terms, and parents typically produced these as an orientation to the enjoyment of their infants', rather than their own, eating practices. The receipting mmms, for instance, occurred at the precise moment when the infant's mouth closed around the food. It is argued that eating enjoyment can be considered as much an interactional practice as an individual sensation, and that non-lexical vocalizations around food are an essential part of sensory practices. The paper thus aims to bridge the gap between cultural and psychological studies of eating enjoyment and contribute to developmental studies of infant feeding in everyday interaction.",

Sexual dysfunctions which impair coital ability, especially ejaculatory difficulties in the male and genital atrophy and loss of vaginal lubrication in the female, are frequent. Menopausal couples are often not knowledgeable about physiologic aging changes that affect sexual performance and are reluctant to communicate sexual difficulties to their partner. Without professional counseling and/or pharmacologic intervention, these conditions may lead to sexual frustration and abstinence.

In the current study, a thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns in semi-structured interviews with 47 older adults, aged 60-91. The analysis yielded seven themes that describe why older adults refrain from sex: 1) avoiding confronting sexual dysfunctions, 2) avoiding confronting the aging body, 3) avoiding performance anxiety, 4) being uninterested in sexual activity, 5) taking time to grieve the loss of a partner, 6) avoiding judgment, and 7) seeing sexuality as evolving and changing. Themes were organized according to the bio-psycho-social perspective and based on the axis of personal (self-focused) and interpersonal (partner-focused) motives. It is perfectly acceptable for people to refrain from sexual activity for their own reasons. However, if older adults want to remain sexually active, they should receive complete information about the many possibilities of treating different sexual problems in later life and about the many ways, beyond sexual penetration, one can enjoy sexual activity even in old age.",

      "title": "The Experience of Shame in Social Phobia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONSocial phobia is highly prevalent anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear of situations where an individual is subject to scrutiny of others. People with social phobia are concerned that they will react with noticeable and embarrassing signs of strong physiological arousal, such as blushing, shaking, or trembling. As consequence, activities such as eating, drinking, writing or speaking in public, expressing an opinion in group, and talking to member of opposite sex or to an authority figure may actively be avoided to evade perceived negative evaluation of others. As most of our everyday functioning involves contact with other people, social phobia can be an extremely disruptive disorder, which usually causes great distress in sufferer and sometimes for those close to them. Despite social phobia being an extremely disruptive and distressing anxiety disorder impacting many areas of an individual's life its etiology is still poorly understood.Parental Rearing Practices and Social PhobiaHaving known mean age of onset of disorder being in early adolescence contribution of early parental rearing practice in development of disorder seems appropriate to be explored. In fact parental rearing practices have been found to be one of key factors contributing to development of social phobia. Investigating role of parental influence on development of anxiety Rapee and Melville (1997) found significant association between child anxiety and greater parental control and protection and less warmth. Retrospective reports from adults with social phobia have also generally supported similar picture of early parental interaction characterized by greater control and less warmth disorder (Arrindell, Emmelkamp, Monsma and Brilman, 1983; Arrindell et al., 1989; Parker, 1979). Gellar (2000) also reported findings emphasizing relationship between social phobia and overprotective and rejecting parenting styles. Greco and Morris (2002) examining associations among perceived and actual father behavior and child social anxiety, found that fathers of high socially anxious children exhibited more controlling behavior. Taylor and Alden (2005) found that patients who reported childhood overprotection were less adept at taking in or discriminating social cues. A positive correlation between overprotection, rejection and children's anxiety symptoms was reported by Muris, Loxtonb, Neumannc, Kinge and Ollendickf (2006). Similarly, Gastel, Legerstee and Ferdinand (2009) found significant association between maternal and paternal overprotection and child anxiety.Shame and Social PhobiaShame was once considered sleeper in psychopathology (Lewis, 1987) has in recent years come to be seen as the bedrock of psychopathology (Miller, 1996). The word comes from Indo-European word skam meaning to hide and implies fear of exposure (Lewis, 1992). Lewis (1971) defines shame as a self-oriented emotion that involves global, negative self-evaluation associated with feeling of helplessness or sense of passivity in correcting perceived fault. Qian, Liu and Zhu (2001) describes shame as type of negative emotion accompanied by negative introspection and self-evaluation, which shows feature of ''self-orientation'' on phenomenological assessment. Many researchers regard shame as most self-reflecting emotion with subsequent self-evaluation in terms of useless, defectiveness, powerless and exposure in relation to others (Barrett, 1995; Gilbert and Andrews, 1998). Central to phenomenology of shame is presence of ''disapproving public eye'' (Hahn, 2000). Thus, when individuals experience shame, this painful awareness of an (actual or imagined) external critic causes feelings of worthlessness and inferiority, coupled with heightened self-consciousness and an instinctual urge to hide from further exposure resulting in avoidance of social interactions (Tangney, Wagner, and Gramzow, 1992). …",

Fur die hier berichtete Studie wurden 20 Manner zwischen 18 und 40 Jahren interviewt, die innerhalb von drei Monaten mindestens einmal ungeschutzten Analverkehr mit anderen Mannern hatten. Ein wesentliches Ergebnis ist, dass viele Befragte, die uber Analverkehr in Gelegenheitsbeziehungen berichteten, an Erfahrungen interessiert waren, die nicht unmittelbar die sexuelle Ebene tangierten. Wesentlich war vielmehr der Wunsch nach Bestatigung des eigenen Wertes und der eigenen physischen Attraktivitat, der Wunsch, eigenen Defiziten oder erlebter Einsamkeit zu entkommen, die Suche nach Verbundenheit und Intimitat, Verliebtheit oder die Tendenz, das Risiko als Vergnugen am Verbotenen umzudefinieren und gegen etablierte Strukturen zu rebellieren. – In all diesen Fallen wurde die Sorge um die eigene Gesundheit und Unversehrtheit wahrend des ungeschutzten Analverkehrs ausgeblendet. Deshalb ist es unbedingt erforderlich, dass HIV- und Aids-Praventionsprogramme auch diese Motivlagen kunftig mehr beachten.\r\nURN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs0902219",

As a consequence, the scope of the leisure professional is broadened and the interdisciplinary nature of leisure studies emphasized.

Minimizing leisure lack is identified as the primary task of the leisure professional. The measurement of leisure (and leisure lack) is an essential condition of this endeavour.",

However, the man whose nights of sleep get frequently disrupted due to painful nocturnal erections, the so called “sleep-related painful erections”, might prefer never to have an erection again. Remarkably, the erotic erections remain undisturbed. Nevertheless, a (sexual) realtionship can be seriously disturbed by the consequences of the sleep deprivation: stress, anxiety, absenteeism and feelings of despair. Only a single prolonged erection, that lasts beyond 4 hours and is called “priapism”, can even cause the penile corporal tissue to become completely necrotic and irreversibly devastated.This thesis describes the historical aspects, symptomatology, pathophysiology and an analysis of different forms of treatment. The aim was to gain attention for these poorly recognized pathologic forms of erection and get one step closer to an evidence-based treatment advise.",

We do not know whether it takes its cue from them, whether the level of sexuality reached colours the form taken by the aggressive urge or whether it is the other way round, with definite stages of aggression giving a particular character to the levels of sex development. Much of it has been confirmed from direct observation, and much has been found from adults, normal and abnormal. This is because the fate of the instinctual energy does not only determine character formation, which means the development of the child in the early years, it also determines normality, the abnormality, the happiness, and the unhappiness—of the adult human being. So the phases of development in the child's love for the mother reflect at one and the same time the whole range of possibilities of disturbance in adult love relationships.",

Based on in-depth interviews with eleven househusbands, this article builds on such research by outlining and analyzing some of the mechanisms of this alienation and some of the adaptations these men made to deal with these experiences. Of particular interest are the problems the men report having with being seen by others as legitimately involved in child care and (to a lesser extent) housework. These data strongly support the idea that the men's sex category overrides other positionings that may be relevant, such as “competent housekeeper” or “full-time househusband and child carer.” Put differently, hegemonic conceptions of who ought to be minding the children and the house subvert or thwart these men's attempts to validate themselves and these practices. The consequences are a feeling of illegitimacy on one hand and social isolation on the other.",

      "abstract": "The article highlights the problems of researching the issue of critical periods in the formation of human sexuality. In particular, attention is focused on adolescence as one of the turning points in a person's psychosexual development, since many sexual problems originate from childhood or adolescence. The limits of adolescence in the understanding of domestic scientists are defined, a concise interpretation of the essence of adolescent sexuality, its differences and characteristic manifestations is provided. The process of development of platonic, erotic, sexual libido is described and the possible consequences in case of \"falling out\" of one of the stages are indicated. The role and significance of the third stage of psychosexual development, which coincides with adolescence and young adulthood, is revealed, the stages included in this stage of the development of human sexuality are outlined, and the tasks faced by adolescents at this time against the background of puberty, increased interest in the opposite sex and the emergence of sex drive Alternative scenarios of the formation of sexuality in the case of violations of psychosexual development or fixations at one of its stages are highlighted. Attention is focused on how disorders of psychosexual development can later affect a person's sexual behavior. It is shown that some complications in the realization of adult genital sexuality can originate from adolescence. On the basis of the studied material, directions for further research are outlined, current problems and ways for further development of relevant training, educational and educational programs for teenagers and adults are determined.",

People “fall in love with their fantasy” and project on to the partner a range of future commitments. If the partner fails to reciprocate, the pair-bond weakens, and the partnership either dissolves or becomes eligible for marital counseling or sex therapy.",

Despite the fact that coming out is viewed by the literature as one of many necessary developmental steps in sexual identity formation and self-acceptance, coming out can be viewed as a unique stage in this developmental continuum. Coming out is an acknowledgment of one's orientation to another person. Thus, coming out is more than an intrapsychic process; it influences interpersonal relationships as well. A whole host of factors, including identity confusion, low self-esteem, depression, alienation, withdrawal, substance abuse, and indulgence in self-destructive behavior, may result if the adolescent has little or no support in this critical developmental stage process. Involvement in the gay community or other types of homosexual peer groups offers a unique sense of support that is especially needed during the coming out period.",

In most animal species, this process is dangerous; vigilance is reduced and vulnerability to predators increased. In mammals, the pattern of hormonal control of the female's sexual behaviour varies across species. Males are more consistent, with testosterone being necessary for both adequate sexual behaviour and male fertility in virtually all species. The variety of socio-sexual structure is also reflected in the level of sexual activity of the male and/or female that characterizes a species. The \"power\" of sexuality tends to be regarded as an aspect of masculinity, with the male, for both social and physical reasons, typically being in a position of dominance. Offering oneself as a sexual partner for payment or other material benefits is a well-established aspect of human sexuality, as well as being evident among primates.",

Although a definitive causal relationship between such difficulties and sexual abuse cannot be established using current retrospective research methodologies, the aggregate of consistent findings in this literature has led many to conclude that childhood sexual abuse is a major risk factor for a variety of problems. This article summarizes what is currently known about these potential impacts of child sexual abuse. The various problems and symptoms described in the literature on child sexual abuse are reviewed in a series of broad categories including posttraumatic stress, cognitive distortions, emotional pain, avoidance, an impaired sense of self, and interpersonal difficulties. Research has demonstrated that the extent to which a given individual manifests abuse-related distress is a function of an undetermined number of abuse-specific variables, as well as individual and environmental factors that existed prior to, or occurred subsequent to, the incidents of sexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "In this research we define the involuntary celibate as one who desires to have sex but has been unable to find a willing partner for at least 6 months prior to being surveyed. The 6-month mark reflects the reality that people often go without sex for weeks or months but after a certain length of time begin to worry. We realize however the arbitrariness of choosing a specific length of time and suggest that what is really important is whether or not persons define themselves as involuntarily celibate. As Thomas (1966) pointed out situations we define as real become real in their consequences. Thus for our purposes length of time without sex is less important than self-defining as involuntarily celibate. Involuntary celibates may be married or partnered persons whose partners no longer desire to have sex with them unpartnered singles who have never had sex or unpartnered singles who have had sexual relationships in the past but are unable to currently find partners. Involuntary celibates include heterosexuals bisexuals homosexuals and transsexuals. We used a life course perspective to understand the process by which persons become and remain involuntarily celibate. In doing so we compared and contrasted three groups of involuntary celibates exploring the transitions and trajectories by which involuntary celibacy developed and was maintained. (excerpt)",

Ein Mann, der vielleicht mehrmals täglich in der Lage ist, einen Geschlechtsverkehr durchzuführen, gilt allgemein auch als besonders fruchtbar. In Herrenwitzen wird ihm auch noch eine besondere Penisgröße und ein muskulöser Habitus zugesprochen. Diese Vorstellungen sind in der Realität absurd und sachlich nicht haltbar. Da besonders sensible Männer, die anatomisch nicht diesen Vorstellungen entsprechen, manchmal darunter leiden, scheint es uns besonders wichtig, diese Phantasievorstellungen auszuräumen. Die Penisgröße erlaubt im Allgemeinen keinerlei Aussagen über die Potenz des Mannes, noch sind muskulöse Männer in der Regel sexuell aktiver als schmalbrüstige Schreibtischarbeiter. Ä hnlich verhält es sich mit dem Zusammenhang zwischen sexueller Aktivität und männlicher Fruchtbarkeit. Jener, in der Praxis eher extrem seltene Mann, der mindestens täglich einmal einen Geschlechtsverkehr ausübt, kann durchaus keinerlei zeugungsfähigen Samen produzieren.",

Some violence prevention actions that Islamic boarding schools can carry out include frequent raids on mobile phones and social media belonging to students or students, conducting various studies on the boundaries that must be maintained between men and women, and so on. Keywords: Violence, women, children, pesantren. Keywords: Violence, Women, Children, Violent objects Abstrak: Kekerasan merupakan suatu tindakan, sikap, ataupun struktur yang menjadi pemicu terjadinya kerusakan pada korbannya, baik kerusakan fisik, maupun nonfisik yang berakibat tidak tercapainya kompetensi manusia secara utuh. Kekerasan memiliki bentuk dan sifat yang sangat beragam, salah satunya yaitu pelecehan seksual. Kekerasan. kekerasan seksual dapat terjadi dimana saja, tidak peduli lembaga pendidikan, kantor, tempat umum, atau bahkan tempat yang dianggap paling aman seperti pondok pesantren sekalipun. Banyak kasus kekerasan di pesantren yang tidak terungkap karena adanya ancaman yang diterima oleh korban dari sang pelaku, korban merasa malu jika mengatakan yang sebenarnya, takut dipandang miring oleh masyarakat, menjatuhkan nama baik keluarga, dan masih banyak lagi alasan lainnya. Beberapa tindak pencegahan kekerasan yang dapat dilakukan oleh lembaga pesantren di antaranya yaitu sering mengadakan razia terhadap handphone dan media sosial milik para santri atau pelajar, melakukan berbagai kajian mengenai batasan yang harus dijaga antara laki-laki dan perempuan, dan lain sebagainya.

      "abstract": "Descriptions of penile circumcision have focused primarily on disease, dysfunction, or sensation, with relatively little consideration of the psychological and psychosocial implications of the procedure. It is also reported to be of interest regarding potential qualitative changes in the subjective experience of sexual activity following changes in penile anatomy (removal of the foreskin) or related sexual biomechanics. Circumcision indeed has psychological, psychosocial, and psychosexual effects. The differences in circumcisions performed during infancy, childhood, and adulthood are remarkable. There are also potential psychosocial effects on parents who may or may not choose circumcision for their children. We argue that additional attention should be paid to the potential for long-term effects of the procedure, which may not be appropriately considered when the patient is an infant or child.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Data are presented regarding the determinants of sexual behavior in men and women aged 46 to 71 years. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were made, involving a variety of physical, psychologic and social measures as independent variables. The level of sexual functioning in younger years, the age and sex of the subject, as well as subjective and objective health ratings, each were found to make independent contributions to the total variance in sexual behavior. A much larger number of variables influenced sexual behavior in men than in women. In women relatively fewer variables — past sexual enjoyment, marital status, and age — were the most significant determinants. These data confirm previous observations that for women the presence of a sexually capable, socially sanctioned partner is a crucial determining influence. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed.",

Then, they attempt to offer a classification based on clinical examples. Secondary sterilities of psychogenic origin are only seen in women who have lost a child in the pre, per or post-partum period. This is even a characteristic example of non organic sterility. Primary sterilities may be psychological in origin, especially by absence of maturation of the child planning project (case of sterilities cured after adoption). They are seen more infrequently: in adult anorexia nervosa, psychological sexual differentiation disorders, masculine women. These difficulties are not easy to approach as much as psychological and organic factors may be entangled. In addition, one question is raised: who should take care of it? The psychiatrist or the gynecologist? Overall, the latter is preferable under the condition that he/she is properly trained. Anyway, it is ultimately the woman's choice.",

Previously unacquainted pairs of 33-month-old children were brought together in same-sex or mixed-sex pairs in a laboratory playroom, and the amount and kind of social behavior directed by each child toward the playmate was recorded. Children directed more social behavior-both positive and negative-to same-sex playmates than to opposite-sex ones. Girls paired with boys were more likely to stand passively watching their partners, or to withdraw toward their mothers, than boys in any pairing or girls playing with girls. Sequential analysis disclosed that boys were unlikely to respond to the vocal prohibitions of girls, while partners did respond to such prohibitions in other pairings. Statistical issues in measuring dyadic interaction are discussed, as are the implications of the findings for children's self-segregation by sex in play groups.",

The first of these is a suit by an il legitimate child asking for damages from his parents or others to compensate him for the stigma or deprivation which the status of il legitimacy generally carries with it. These cases have been discussed elsewhere.1 Another kind of suit to which the same label is some times attached is that which arises when a man or woman engages a physician to perform an operation for sterilization or to supply con traceptive devices and a child is later born as a result of the physi cian's alleged negligence in performing the operation or in pro viding the contraception. This claim is made by the parents, not the child, and therefore involves quite different issues from those in the suit by the illegitimate child. It is sometimes also referred to as a suit for wrongful or wrongful conception. A third type of claim arises when a woman gives birth to a defective or deformed or mentally retarded child as a result of the alleged negligence of her physician either in not preventing the birth or in not informing her",

Semen is a sensitive indicator of environmental, occupational and lifestyle exposures that can exert direct toxic effects and hormonal disruption. Damage may occur at any stage of life. However, while some exposures may produce reversible changes, others, especially damage to germinal cells in utero or prepuberty, may result in permanent sequelae. We review the main factors that affect human male fertility and their possible influence on human reproduction. Some lifestyles, xenoestrogens, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds are already known to compromise male reproductive function. Nonetheless, many questions remain, and we still know little about the effect of many other factors on male fertility.",

      "title": "Sexual abuse of children and adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Parents, relatives, and friends may inflict their passions on children of the same or opposite sex. This is often initiated by sleeping together. Sexual abuse contributes to and causes emotional trauma, although the child's turmoil, confusion, wish for acceptance, and anxiety may be overlooked by the parent and professional. Mutual silence aided by threats adds to the anxiety. Despite the notion that reports of parental sexual exploitation of their children are usually fantasies, there appear to be increasing data that incest and sexual abuse are frequent traumata. At present, there is increased risk of lowering the incest barrier because of increased rates of divorce and step- or surrogate parenthood, since they provide additional potential for being sexually and emotionally traumatized. Sexual abuse seems to be part of a constellation involving neglect and a pathological symbiosis. That sexual abuse is emotionally traumatic is apparent, but it needs emphasizing. Children's defensive reactions may cloud this, and it may be years before such incidents are connected to symptomatic behavior, even when the child is in intensive therapy. In the reported cases, there appears to be a pattern of reactions and defenses related to the traumata that are embedded in imprinting and identification with the aggressor. This leads to sexual abuse being a legacy passed on to the next generation of victims, as the victim becomes the molester through identification. Adolescent self-destructive behavior may stem from guilt about sexually abusing younger children. Therapists may be better able to understand and deal with some of their patients' symptoms if sexual abuse is considered as a possible factor in one or both directions.",

      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Aware of changes that are happening, teenagers are becoming more intrested in sexuality and at that age they become sexually active. As young people who explore something new, they don't have enough knowledge, informations and experience so they are engaging in risky sexual behaviors. Risky sexual behavior is the potential of negative effects caused by sexual activities. The aim of this paper work is to get acquainted with the concept and types of risky sexual behaviors that are manifested in adolescence as well as the consequences of such behaviors as well as important factors in the environment of adolescents that may affect their risk behavior. This paper work describes two risky sexual behaviors that are most commonly reported in adolescents, and this is a sexual relationship under influence of alcohol and sexual intercourse without protection. By engaging in risky sexual relationships, there is a great potential for negative consequences such as: pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and sexual victimization. That what can trigger and be the cause of risky sexual behavior of adolescents are risk factors that can be at an individual level, then the risk factors on the side of a narrower environment involving the family and peers, as well as social level and social standards.",

      "abstract": "It was hypothesized that actions to benefit the next generation would not lead to well-being unless they are perceived to be valued and respected and that the lack of perceived respect would further lead to disengagement from generative goals. Older persons responded to measures of generative concern, action, perceived respect, and psychological well-being at 2 time points 12 months apart. Structural equation modeling showed that at both time points, the effect of action on well-being was completely mediated by perceived respect. Moreover, a lack of perceived respect at baseline predicted a decrease in generative concern 12 months later, suggesting that, in later life, continuing concern is partly dependent on the attitudes of younger generations. When their attitudes are unfavorable, a downward spiral in generativity development and well-being is possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This book discusses cases where it’s unclear whether a person’s consent to sex should count as valid consent, the kind of consent that makes it permissible for the person they give consent to to have sex with them. Clear cases of coercion, for example, involve the threat of significant physical harm. But what should we say about cases involving the threat of harms that are relatively insignificant or that involve no physical harm at all? Impersonating someone’s spouse to trick them into saying yes to sex is clearly seriously wrong, but what about the more mundane kinds of lies people tell when they’re trying to meet someone? It’s wrong to have sex with someone who says yes when they’re so drunk they’re about to pass out and not wrong if they say yes after having a few sips of beer. What, though, should we say about the more difficult cases in the middle where it’s genuinely unclear whether they’ve had too much to drink? What’s the most reasonable view about other forms of incompetent consent to sex, like those involving young children, elderly dementia patients, or people born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments? And what about cases of problematic sexual consent that don’t involve coercion, deception, or incompetence at all? Can a patient give valid consent to sex with their therapist? Can the offer of a large amount of money in exchange for sex invalidate the sexual consent the offer elicits? This book addresses these and related questions.",

      "abstract": "Sex counseling is needed because those people with sexual problems tend to magnify the problems and dwell on them at the cost of all the other important activities of day to day living. The topics covered in sex counseling include impotence (62.5%), premature ejaculation (11.7%), ejaculation dysfunction (13.0%) in case of male, and frigidity (19.1%), sexual aversion/fear (23.0%), and functional disorders of sexual organs (22.4%) in case of female. Frigidity and vaginismus as well as most male problems are within the scope of sex counseling and therapy, but many of the female complaints are psychological and they require marriage counseling. Sexual awareness is both inherited and acquired. 6 weeks after fertilization the presence or absence of Y chromosome already begins to influence both structural and functional development of fetus, and its influence continues throughout our lives. Free creative expression of sexual awareness is bound to clash with social conventions, and that conflict causes stress in some individuals and maturity in others. Positive handling of sexuality promises enriched lives, and sex counseling contributes toward that goal.",

      "title": "It Isn’t Just Them",
      "abstract": "It Isn’t Just Them Kathryn Lofton51 For some time I thought about the problem of sex abuse by clergy as a historian of religion and as a person who grew intellectually through reading queer and feminist theory. But over the last several years I have increasingly considered such abuses in the context of ongoing revelations about misconduct in higher education. When I was thinking intensely about sex abuse in the lead-up to a conference, “Sex Abuse and the Study of Religion,” that I hosted with Robert Orsi and Terence McKiernan at Yale in September 2011, I came across this description of the web of emotions that occurs in sexually abusive relationships from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: The child of five or older who knows and cares for the abuser becomes trapped between affection or loyalty for the person, and the sense that the sexual activities are terribly wrong. If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love. When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.52 Within the documentary materials available, this standardized profile of abuse is rendered relentlessly specific to Catholicism. Sexual abuse is a practice within an existent relational dynamic, one that simultaneously transforms and calcifies the hierarchies and codes that determined the original affiliation. For me it would be absurd to talk about Roman Catholic sex abuse in today’s context without also thinking about what learning about it can help us understand about the hierarchical spaces in which scholars spend so much of our time. If abuse is a ritual practice of hierarchy, then it might be inevitable that institutions—academic and Roman [End Page 26] Catholic—include significant abuse. Consider the above description from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Note how it described that the child becomes trapped between affection for their abuser and recognition of the wrong they make; how they know what they are doing is wrong, but they can’t break from that wrong abuse because they might then experience other repercussions, including, most chillingly, loss of love. How many situations of abuse in the academy occur on the exact same terms? That the abused person needs the relationship, needs that bad love, they think, more than the freedom from it. Why? Because if they say what is happening is wrong, they don’t just destroy this particular relationship. As is written: “When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.” Nobody wants to break up with love—the love of a caretaker, the love of knowledge. Even more: nobody wants to break up with the container in which the love is transferred: the family, the church, or the university. What if the secret of the academy is told? To tell the truth of one abuse of power is to show the abuse of power that suffuses the whole system. Because while every story is particular, every individual faculty member or student singular, the refrain once told is not: “I was afraid to tell the truth. I worried that I wouldn’t get a good letter of recommendation. I worried I wouldn’t get a job.” We are silent because the system keeps us in it by our desire to stay in it, to keep it, to keep open the possibility that we could become a part of it. I need the family, I need this job; I need these more than I need my security from the harm they do me. This is a very, very hard problem to solve. Our love of learning, and of the institutions that facilitate our learning, is a tender thing. We want to stay in it: to be in that place. We want to be in it—we will lie to keep ourselves in it. We will cover up the pain it...",

      "title": "Postmenopausal sexual functioning: a case study.",
      "abstract": "Most men and women remain sexually active into mid-life and beyond. However, sexual functioning in peri- and postmenopausal women, and their partners, is widely variable. Somatic symptoms, psychological issues, partner's physical, psychological, and relationship status are all important to one's perceived quality of life, and may greatly affect sexuality. These wide-ranging influences complicate assessment, diagnosis, and subsequent management of sexual problems. A number of factors influence sexual functioning in menopausal women. There are age-related changes that are unrelated to menopause, which include changes in drive, body image, and general health status. Beliefs about menopause and sexuality impact sexual functioning in women. Changes in relationship status and the physical health of a partner may also influence sexuality. Physiologic changes, directly related to menopausal hormone changes, often impact sexual functioning, both directly and indirectly. Health care providers can play an important role in treating sexual problems and enhancing sexuality in aging patients. Effective evaluation will result in accurately determining the source(s) of an individual's or a couple's sexual dysfunction. Treatment may include the following: basic education about sexuality and sexual functioning, normalizing sexual activity in aging adults, medical management of symptoms or problems that are interfering with sexual desire or activity (such as HRT for vaginal atrophy or in reduction of hot flashes), referral for treatment of the partner's physical or psychological problem, and/or sex therapy to treat a sexual dysfunction or to manage a chronic physical problem that requires a change in a person's or couple's typical sexual repertoire. This paper includes a detailed case history of a couple to illustrate the concepts mentioned above.",

      "abstract": "Rape is a sexual act committed against a person without consent or without explicit consent. This is a very serious form of sexual violence and violates human rights. Rape can occur in a variety of contexts, including during an intimate relationship, by someone you know, or even by a stranger. This can cause deep physical and emotional trauma to victims, as well as having far-reaching impacts on society as a whole. It is important to take steps to prevent rape and provide support to victims. Rape carried out on women or men usually causes very severe trauma to them. Usually, the person becomes uncomfortable, insecure, and afraid of meeting people. He will feel alone forever, and think about ending himself, because he thinks that he is no longer pure. Usually, rape is committed by someone or several individuals, known or unknown, who deliberately rape the victim. Rape may occur because the perpetrator likes the victim, or because the perpetrator wants revenge on the victim, or there is something else. Women are creatures of God Almighty who are very perfect, because they give birth and breastfeed. In Indonesia, there are still many cases of rape that occur against women and children. The motive may be because the perpetrator likes the victim, or the perpetrator just wants revenge on the victim, or it was planned long ago by the perpetrator. Rape against women or girls is a form of sexual violence that occurs when someone commits a sexual act against a woman without her consent. This may include vaginal, anal, or oral penetration, as well as other sexual acts carried out with violence, threats, coercion, or the woman's inability to provide valid consent. Rape against women is often a form of expression of systematic gender inequality and domination. It is important to remember that rape does not only happen to women, but can also happen to men or individuals of various other gender identities. Nevertheless, rape of women is often in the spotlight due to its high prevalence and serious impact on the well-being of women and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to continue fighting sexual violence and fighting for gender equality to create a safe and inclusive society for all individuals.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Perspective of Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder that is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions. OCD can occur in a wide range of subtypes, which may include sexual OCD, i.e., the occurrence of intrusive sexual thoughts. People with sexual OCD may experience unwanted obsessive sexual thoughts about a family member, dead or inanimate objects, animals, God, or children, which can range from mild to severe levels of occurrence. The psychodynamic perspective on OCD suggests that the content of obsessive thinking is commonly drawn from primitivized sexuality and aggression. It further suggests that in the absence of key relationships that include emotional proximity, mirroring and containment, and attunement, a child experiences a void-like state. Consequently, the anxiety that arises in the child leads to a form of liveliness in a “dead” inner world. However, it occurs out of a sense of abandonment and loss of good objects, and ultimately out of fear of annihilation. As a result, the child resorts to maladaptive defense mechanisms. The study attempts to explore the adverse early childhood experiences such as parental neglect, mother–father conflict, and lack of parental love and care leading to fixation in psychosexual stages of development, which further leads to the adoption of maladaptive defense mechanisms that in turn further contribute to the development of obsessional personality traits. This study aims to explain the psychodynamic perspective on the emergence of sexual obsessions by proceeding with a case study approach by taking a diagnosed case of OCD. A comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment was conducted with the help of Draw-a-Person Test, Thematic Apperception Test, Rotter’s Incomplete Sentence Blank, and Million’s Comprehensive Multiaxial Inventory. The analysis of the assessment protocol revealed a strong relationship between the defense mechanism, personality traits, and the development of obsessive symptoms.",

It was found that both health status and perceived partner's responsiveness are prominent moderators of the age effect.In the absence of social isolation and health issues, many older men show persistently active sexual lifestyles as evidenced in their interest and participation in sexual activities.

Mussen and M. D.

The young adolescent is still very much a child at this stage, who depends on family, is concerned about body changes, and is prone to anxiety. Adolescent girls who mature early are at greater risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms than are girls who mature at the \"normal\" time, and get into more behavioral problems.

      "title": "Serotonergic Projections: Religiosity and Hyper-Religiosity",
      "abstract": "Religiosity is a widespread and important influence on human behavior and well-being. In a recent national poll, 95 percent of Americans professed a belief in God, and 67 to 75 percent of respondents reported that they pray on a daily basis [1]. Research findings showed that although regular attendance at church was not necessary, a strong personal importance placed on spirituality or religion was most protective against major depression in people who were at high familial risk. Religious beliefs serve an important function in the daily lives and attitudes of most of us. Religious activity embraces beliefs, experiences, and practice. Conversely, a person’s fervent religious practices can also signify other, gloomier facets of his or her mental health. The term used to define such a case is hyperreligiosity in the case of religious beliefs. The question of excess or hyper becomes a factor when the religion begins adversely affecting people’s social behavior and their ability to function rationally. A number of potential genetic and pathophysiological causes of violence and aggression have been investigated over recent years. Research now points to the discovery that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of defective emotion regulation circuitry in the brain.",

      "abstract": "There are significant numbers of well-documented cases of the following general kind. At the age of 3 or 4 a child starts to make claims about his past which clearly do not correspond to anything that has happened in his present life. He claims to remember living in a certain place, doing certain things, being with certain people, and so on. It is then found that these memory claims fit the life of a person who died shortly before the child was born. The accuracy of the memory claims is striking and there seems to be no possible normal explanation of this. The child also has certain character traits, interests and skills which correspond closely to those of the one who died; and, perhaps, a physical characteristic, such as a birthmark or wound, which closely resembles a characteristic of the earlier individual.",

Of the 12 million girls born in India every year, 1.5 million girls die before the age of one and one out of every four does not live to celebrate her fifteenth birthday due to gender discrimination and gross neglect. This can be linked to neglect of females as infants, as children, as adolescents, and as mothers. Impaired mental and emotional health is a precursor or consequence of many health-risk behaviors such as physical, sexual, social, or emotional abuse. These dilemmas arise out of everyday issues like peer influence, dating identity, emerging sexuality, independence, separation, identity crises, anxiety, and responsibility as well as more serious ones like violent behavior, experimental sex, teenage suicides, and other health-related disorders.",

There are two main types of rape fantasies: aversive rape fantasies, which usually involve the use of force to coerce sex and often contain painful violence with no sexual arousal; and erotic rape fantasies, which typically involve low to moderate levels of fear with no realistic violence. Rape fantasies seem to be a social enigma. There are various theories that attempt to rationalize the occurrence of rape fantasies. However, additional research is needed to provide empirical support for such conceptualizations.",

      "abstract": "Narratives about death produced by children between three-and-one-half and nine-and-one-half years of age were analyzed. Death narratives were almost nonexistent in children under five-and-one-half years of age, but the majority of children who were six or older spontaneously produced narratives about death. Children under nine years of age discuss death as a dramatic event to be told like a television story plot; there is no affective reaction to the deaths of strangers, pets, or relatives. With one exception, only the nine year old children indicated emotional reactions to a death, or their affection for the deceased. This contrast suggests that younger children have difficulty coping with death in emotional terms, and suppress or deny their affective reactions to it. Additionally, three children talked about the death of a parent; none produced narratives with evaluation and affective reactions to these deaths. These children denied the parent's death as well, by talking of the deceased parent as if he or she were still alive in other narratives. The possibility of a “distance phenomenon” in children's ability to cope with death emotionally as the victims become closer to the child is suggested.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a mental and / or physical state of addiction to certain psychoactive substances, behaviors or situations. They can be different, and each has its own significance, degree of intensity, psychological, social and economic dimensions. Alcohol is considered to be the most commonly abused substance in Europe, including Croatia. No celebration from the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans until today has passed without the consumption of alcohol. Also, alcohol is considered to be the first psychoactive substance that people encounter, specifically young people aged 14 years. Alcoholism is an addiction to alcohol, while an alcoholic according to the definition of the World Health Organization is a person who has become addicted to alcohol through long-term drinking, mentally, physically or in both ways and has developed mental or physical impairments and social difficulties accessible to traditional medical and social diagnostic procedures. The clinical picture of alcoholism is first manifested in the very appearance of the alcoholic, and then in his change of personality, which in turn leads to the deterioration of their own health, relationships in the family and in society, job loss. All of the above components can contribute to the worsening of the condition. The diagnosis of alcoholism is made on the basis of anamnestic data of disease symptoms, medical examination, heteroanamnestic data, which are most often given by family members, laboratory tests and various questionnaires. Alcoholism treatment consists of treatment that includes strict abstinence and lifestyle changes, then outpatient treatment and inclusion in self-help and mutual aid groups such as Alcoholics Clubs and Alcoholics Anonymous. This paper will consist of two parts. In the first part I will define the concept of alcoholism, explain the epidemiology and etiology of alcoholism, then the effects of alcohol on the body, the clinical picture of alcoholism, diagnosis, treatment, consequences of alcoholism and the role of the nurse in people addicted to alcohol. The second part consists of a survey questionnaire conducted online using the Google Docs application. The main goal of the research was to determine whether alcoholism is still the leading harmful habit in the 21st century.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Whilst loneliness and social isolation amongst older care-givers are becoming increasingly recognised, little is known about how these concepts impact on specific sub-groups of care-givers, such as older males. In the current study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the experiences of loneliness and social isolation amongst older spousal male care-givers. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 24 participants, caring for a spouse/partner with a long-term chronic condition. After thematic analysis of the data, three themes were identified: dwindling social interactions, loneliness in the spousal relationship, and living with loneliness and social isolation. Study findings suggest that opportunities for social interactions gradually ‘dwindled’ due to a reluctance by older male care-givers to leave their spouse/partner at home alone, to accept offers of help or respite, or to attend social events without their spouse/partner. Consequently, social isolation increased. Feelings of physical and emotional loneliness were evident, and the loss of spousal companionship (such as loss of conversation and shared interests) increased loneliness. Individualised coping strategies were adopted including focusing on moments of positivity, talking to others and using prescribed medication. Findings provide insight into the experience of loneliness and social isolation for many older male spousal care-givers. This may facilitate a better understanding of older male care-givers’ support needs in addressing loneliness and social isolation, and should help to inform the development of targeted support services for this population.",

      "abstract": "The capacity for sensate experience develops very early in life, begining prenatally. What the child lacks is opportunity, not capacity. Yet children are denied the full range of sexual experiences consistent with their capacity. At least this is true of children brought up in secretive and repressive societies. On the other hand, the full range of cognitive capacity in humans does not emerge during childhood and is not available until adolescence at best. Management of the sexual life at a rational level appears difficult to attain for persons brought up in secretive repressive societies. Therefore much more thought and attention has to go into the development of quality sex education, education that takes into account the child's cognitive capacity plus any developmental lag in learning resulting from lack of prior sexual experience or the negative effects of furtive sexual encounters and negative parental reactions to such encounters.

      "title": "Personality and sexual relations.",
      "abstract": "This investigation examined the links between self-monitoring propensities and orientations toward sexual relations. A factor analysis of behavioral and attitudinal survey data revealed that high selfmonitoring individuals tend to establish an unrestricted orientation toward sexual relations (such that they may engage in sex with others to whom they are not necessarily psychologically close), whereas low self-monitoring individuals tend to establish a restricted orientation (such that they will engage in sex only with partners to whom they are psychologically close). At the behavioral level, high relative to low self-monitoring individuals indicated that they had a larger number of different sexual partners within the preceding year, could foresee themselves having sex with a larger number of different partners within the next 5 years, and were more likely to have engaged in sex with someone on only one occasion. At an attitudinal level, low relative to high self-monitoring individuals indicated that they would be more reluctant to have sex with someone to whom they were not committed, and that they would be more uncomfortable with, and less likely to enjoy engaging in, casual sex with different partners. Possible origins and implications of these contrasting orientations are discussed. Throughout the ages, it has been a matter for contemplation, debate, and personal statement: Given human nature, what is the role of love, closeness, and commitment in sexual relations between consenting partners? Are and commitment necessary prerequisites for sexual relations? Is the sexual experience empty and meaningless without psychological closeness between the partners? Or can sex be a comfortable, enjoyable, and even enriching experience for partners who, although attracted to each other, are not psychologically close? If one samples literary, academic, or personal statements made on this issue, one is likely to find pronounced disagreement. Compare and contrast, for instance, the views of Bertrand Russell, Civilized people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love (1929), and Adrienne Rich, I'd call it if love/ didn't take so many years/ but lust too is a jewel (1966). Indeed, at least within Western cultures, there may be reliable and substantive differences in orientations toward sexual relations. Some people believe that—at least for themselves—sexual relations need not be restricted to relationships in which they and their partners are psychologically close. They may claim, for instance, that if they were attracted to someone, they would feel comfortable and at ease engaging in sex with that person, even if they did not know him or her well. Such people may be said to",

These assaults are extremely dangerous not only due to their direct physical traumas received at the time of the abuse, but they also have long-term consequences that can worsen the future quality of the victim’s life. A retrospective study of all cases related to child sexual abuse for five years was performed by materials of the Clinic of Forensic Medicine and Deontology, Sofia, Bulgaria. Ninety-five cases involve children from both genders. The traumatic injuries were carefully examined and classified according to their localization over the victim’s bodies and based on the time that had passed after the reported assaults. In cases of sexual violence, the most informative and pointing at the exact type of violence are the injuries situated in the anogenital area. Too often, there is a lack of physical findings, depending on the type of sexual violence or associated with the prolonged time that passes after the crime. Children are unaware of what they have to do after suffering such traumas, or they are scared to share their experience with different family members, which can lead to late forensic examination and lack of physical and biological findings, which are the most critical traces in the criminal prosecution of the crimes and this can be a possibility for the perpetrator not to be charged for his unlawful actions.",

At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.",

      "abstract": "Old age is nowadays becoming an increasingly important period of life. Settled relationship and satisfying one's sexual needs importantly contribute to the overall contentment in life, which is also essential for the quality of old age. The presented thesis is devoted to the research of the mutual influence between the quality of relationship and sexual activity in late life. In the theoretical part, I specify the period of old age, define the concept of the quality of old age and introduce prejudice towards old age and sex in this period of life. After that I describe different perspectives on sexuality and take a closer look on the link between the relationship and sexuality. In the end of the theoretical part, I focus on physical and psychological changes that are important for a better understanding of the sexuality of older people. In the empirical part, I present the results of a qualitative research within which I conducted interviews with six elderly people. I was interested in the connection between the relationship and the sexual activity in old age, how older people feel about the sexuality and whether the sexuality changes over the years. The results show that the relationship is closely associated with the sexual activity and with the overall sexual satisfaction. The perceptions of sexuality have not changed significantly over the years, however, the importance of touching, caressing, hugging and expressing any kind of affection came to the fore. The physiological changes that the elderly are facing, have an important additional effect on the latter.",

      "title": "Behavioural Changes At Adolescence in Chimpanzees",
      "abstract": "Male chimpanzees experience puberty (marked testicular growth and ejaculation) when they are about 9 years old and just over half adult weight. They reach adult weight at 14-15 years. Females start small sexual swellings at about 8 years, mate with adult males when they are about 10.5 years and have their first infants when they are about 12 years. Males reduce their constant association with their mothers when they reach puberty and associate more with adult males and cycling females. Some males form strong, long-lasting associations with particular adult males. Females remain with their mothers until first oestrus,and then associate with adult males either in their natal community or a new community during oestrus. The decline in association with the mother is more closely correlated with pubertal stage than with chronological age in both sexes. Immatures of all ages spend 3-13% of their time in social grooming, but grooming partners change during adolescence. Juveniles of both sexes groom their mothers and siblings most, but males groom individuals outside their maternal unit more than do females. Juveniles receive over 90% of their grooming from mothers and siblings. Adolescent males groom less with their mothers and more with cycling females and adult males. While early adolescent males start to be groomed by females only late adolescent males receive any grooming from adult males. Adolescent females without mothers groom little except with adult males when they are in oestrus. Social play is most frequent with individuals aged 2-9 years and individuals play most with others of their age. Time spent playing by both sexes declines markedly during adolescence. Juveniles and early adolescents of both sexes have friendly interactions with infants, but late adolescents rarely interact with infants. Males show frequent sexual behaviour with oestrous females from an early age. Males spend more time with oestrous females as they get older but frequency of copulation declines gradually through adolescence. Early adolescent males try to take females on consort, but only late adolescent males succeed. One female rejected the sexual advances of a male once he reached puberty. Rates of interference in copulations by males decline during adolescence and males become more cautious of copulating in the presence of adult males. Females show little sexual behaviour until they start getting large oestrus swellings. Males receive increased aggression from adult males during adolescence. They become tense in the presence of adult males and even late adolescents are peripheral to grooming clusters of adult males. Males start to challenge adult females in adolescence but are often attacked, and are not able to dominate them all until late adolescence. Male juveniles perform elements of charging displays without hair erection more frequently than females. The freqency of this declines in adolescence while the frequency of charging displays with hair erection by males increases in adolescence and displays become increasingly more adult-like in length and form. Males show the shoulder hunch for the first time in early adolescence. Males pant hoot more than females and rates of pant-hooting increase with age in both sexes.",

Perhaps a reason for this has been the absence of a unified model of etiology and treatment that includes the most salient motivational factors unique to various subtypes of perpetrators. Such a model would have to be sufficiently flexible to account for the various sexually aggressive modes of expression without being unnecessarily complex or simplistic if it is to be clinically useful. Specifically with respect to sexual aggression against children, a quadripartite model is proposed that includes physiological sexual arousal, cognitions that justify sexual aggression, negative affective states, and personality problems as motivational precursors that increase the probability of sexually aggressive behavior. The relative prominence of these precursors is used as a guideline for assessing and treating particular subtypes of perpetrators. Failure to consider the primary motivational precursor during the initial stages of treatment also may account for the limited success of current treatments.",

The tragic consequence of a sexual intercourse between an adult and a child is always the death of a child. This simple brutal truth is the heavy weight that hits the analyst when he becomes close to an abused child, or to someone who had been abused as a child. Adults too struggle to visualise an abusive situation, especially if the perpetrator is someone close, someone 'above suspicion', so it happens frequently that when the child finds the strength and words to ask for help, he meets up with a barrier of disbelief and accusation that leaves him in the most desperate solitude. An abuse finds infinite representations to express itself. The betrayal of a partner becomes an obscure evil that nests in the body and invades the mind. An examination turns into the fear of an invasion leaving behind a nameless anguish.",

      "abstract": "People with cognitive disabilities are commonly positioned as risky sexual subjects. This article discusses the discursive production of sexual normates in the form of desirable and normative able-minded sexual subjects, in scientific research on the sexuality and cognitive disabilities of younger and older individuals (in particular those with dementia). We identify three interrelated discourses: regulating sexuality; fostering sexuality; and preserving sexuality. The first of these, regulation, pathologises sexuality of people with cognitive disabilities as faulty and in need of restriction. The second discourse, fostering, is more affirmative and argues for educating for a 'healthy' sexuality of people with cognitive disabilities, to mitigate risks of abuse. This discourse is more salient with younger people. The third discourse, preservation, in contrast, is more visible with older people with dementia and affirms sexuality so long as it is consistent with a 'genuine' or 'authentic' sexuality of the past. In conclusion, scientific research reinforces the cultural ideal of the rational and autonomous individual (and as such the mature/adult) capable of making independent decisions and engaging in healthy, good sex, based on stable sexual identities. Findings demonstrate how age intersects with cognitive ableism to intensify the cultural anxiety that exists around the sexualities of people with cognitive disabilities.",

The associations of prolonged sedentary behaviour with both physical and mental health are less researched than in adults or children but show a clear pattern of increased mortality, reduced function, frailty, mental health, and longevity. Evidence on interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults is still scarce and studies show only small effect sizes, have short or no follow up beyond the intervention period and are often in combination with efforts to increase physical activity.

Audiences vary in their reactions; what’s wrongful in one audience may be acceptable in another—hence, deviance is relative to audience, society, subgroup, context, and historical time. Typically, reactions express negative attitudes toward the violations of a strongly-held norm. Such reactions are varied, and include condemnation, withdrawing from the presence of the offender, and the unwillingness to join in interaction with the offending party or parties. Most members of the society can perform a mental experiment to picture what these reactions are likely to be for a range of audiences. The researcher conducted a survey among 60 park-goers to determine what is considered wrongful in the park. In the park, multiple parties put on performances of extremely eccentric or deviant behaviour. Felonious crime is very rare in the park; milder forms of deviance are common, however, including offensive staring and selling marijuana. Public gay sex, which used to be common, has all but disappeared there.",

Regardless of the emotional circumstances that surround the actual experience and the way in which they take place, an aggressive, even violent fantasy is very frequently associated with the 'first time'. This fantasy can complicate or hinder access to a shared sexuality with a partner. This article links such fantasies, on the one hand, to the Oedipal disappointment often experienced when a young person takes their initial step into genital sexuality, and, on the other, to the revival of an infantile sexuality endowed with a sense of separation. The exploration of the violent fantasies and death drive in therapy may facilitate the advent of a more consensual form of engagement with the other.",

Sex outcome at birth is the result of a coordinated and sequential series of developmental events controlled by temporally expressed genes and hormones. The birth of an infant with ambiguous genitalia is one of the most difficult challenges faced by physicians. Management is compounded by psychological, social, ethical, and sexual concerns. Genetic issues dominate the pathophysiology of disorders of sex development, and in the long term management would include the skills of counselors trained in psychosexual issues affecting children and adolescents. The management of disorders of sex development is quite complex, and a multidisciplinary team network of appropriate professionals is essential. The decision of sex of rearing and the timing of surgery need careful consideration within a multidisciplinary environment with full informed consent of the family. This review gives an overview of disorders of sex development with emphasis on the more frequently encountered anomalies, the pathophysiology, presentation, and management.

      "abstract": "espanolLa incontinencia urinaria es un problema que sufre un 15,8% de la poblacion. Es conocida su repercusion a nivel sanitario, social y economico, pero tambien tiene repercusion laboral. Con un impacto negativo notable sobre multiples aspectos de la vida diaria, tanto en el entorno social (menor interaccion social o mayor aislamiento), como en el fisico, sexual, psicologico (perdida de autoestima, depresion) y laboral (absentismo, menos relacion). El efecto que la incontinencia urinaria provoca en la calidad de vida de quien la padece es igual, o mas importante, que la sintomatologia clinica de esta disfuncion, habiendo sido durante mucho tiempo infravalorado el grado de molestia percibido por los pacientes que la sufren. El abordaje de este problema debe ser multifocal, y abarcar todos los ambitos en que influye, entre los cuales destaca el ambito laboral. EnglishBackground: the urinary incontinence is a problem that suffers 15,8% of the population. The urinary incontinence repercussion is known also sanitary, social and economic context; but also in daily work it has profound effects in. It has a very negative impact on multiple aspects of the living, so much in the social environment (minor social interaction or major isolation), in the physical, in the sexual, in the psychological (loss of autoesteem, depression), and in the labor atmosphere (absenteeism, fewer relation with partners). The urinary incontinence effect in the quality of life is equal, or more importantly than the clinical symptomatology of this dysfunction for the person who suffers from urinary incontinence, and it has being underestimated for a long time the trouble valued by the patients with urinary incontinence. The way of boarding this problem must be multifocal, including all the areas which it has repercussion, emphasize the work enviroment.",

      "title": "Sex 'n' drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll: the meaning and social consequences of pubertal timing",
      "abstract": "This is a brief review of the normal changes in adolescent behaviour and the interplay between biology and social factors that occur at and around puberty, in an attempt to explain when this transition may become problematic The onset of puberty is a biological marker for an individual's transition from a non-reproductive to a reproductive state. Adolescence is a normal developmental transition associated with clearly visible physical changes, reorganization and pruning of neuronal circuits in the brain and the occurrence of new behaviours and interests. It is a time when new life tasks (orientation towards peers of the other sex, romantic and sexual involvement and mastering an educational career) need to be mastered. Parent-child conflict increases and becomes more intense as the adolescent struggles for more independence while still requiring support. These normal changes can become problematic if biological and social expectations diverge e.g. entering puberty very early or very late. While early pubertal onset in boys is likely to have beneficial effects, in girls precocious pubertal timing may have a negative impact on body-image, affect (or emotional well-being) and sex-role expectations. Other individual biological predispositions and genetic endowment may interact with social factors (e.g. peers, parenting style, neighbourhood) making adolescence either an adaptive or a challenging transition. There is a lack of sufficiently large longitudinal studies that have been able to study this interaction between genetics, biology and social environment on adolescent development. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of pubertal timing on social behaviour. Planned assessments and concepts are outlined.",

      "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure produces a broad range of primary disabilities that lead to adverse life course outcomes in children raised in adverse environments. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are a commonly occurring secondary disability, with a large minority of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) displaying sexual aggression. Adults with FASD who commit repeated criminal sexual acts may be subject to legal proceedings for indefinite involuntary civil confinement as sexually violent predators/persons (SVP) in certain jurisdictions in the United States. Studies about the diagnostic practices among psychologists and psychiatrists retained by states to evaluate individuals as SVP do not recognize FASD as a mental disorder, despite the likelihood that hundreds of individuals petitioned for involuntary commitment suffer from FASD. Establishing an FASD diagnosis may provide exculpatory evidence to refute a government petition that an individual suffers from a mental condition that affects emotional or volitional capacity by predisposing the person to committing criminal sexual behavior. This article provides a framework for identifying, assessing, and deciding whether individuals with the FASD diagnosis suffer from the legally defined mental disorder that is necessary to indefinitely confine individuals as SVP.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The narratives of six Israeli men and nine Israeli women who divorced at ages above 45 were analyzed by qualitative methods to explore the process of marital deterioration in this age group, in marriages of fifteen years and more. Narrators' ratings of their marriages ranged from \"excellent\" to \"disastrous.\" The major causes of marital failure described were lack of emotional mutuality and communication, physical and emotional abuse, and alternative adulterous relationships. Health and other crises were significant for some couples. Half the couples had been in marital therapy and half in individual therapy. Severe problems went on for many years, as did the contemplation of divorce. Some reported great suffering yet did not find the strength to initiate a divorce. Often a personal growth experience or development of inner strength helped one side to take the initiative to divorce after years of mutual suffering. The narrators emphasized suffering within the marriage more heavily than outside attractions; but half of the initiators had alternative relationships at the time of the initiation. Divorce in this group was a process that developed over a long time, not a spontaneous or impulsive response to any immediate acute trigger.",

Sexual health problems can be caused by an ongoing illness, medication use, past surgery and/or relationship issues. The WHO has defined 'sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well being in relation to sexuality and it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity' [1]. Good sexual health comprises an absence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), fertility problems and unwanted pregnancies and also the ability to enjoy one's sexuality without abuse and/or oppression [1]. The topic of sex and sexuality in itself is now no longer confined to hushed discussions in the twenty-first century. Yet, there is still anxiety and abstinence when the topic of sex comes up for discussion, especially more so between the clinician and the patient [2, 3]. This leaves a tremendous void in the delivery of complete holistic healthcare.",

For centuries to millennia, sexual violence has been used as a means to subjugate, control, or demean women and other vulnerable populations. Sexual violence can have substantial physical and mental health effects on survivors. Health consequences of sexual violence vary from mild to severe medical, gynecological, obstetric, surgical, psychological, and psychiatric trauma. The most common sequelae of sexual violence are mental health consequences, and the effects of violence manifest in different ways throughout the life span. Adults commonly experience depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic disorders. Mental health sequelae of violence manifest somewhat differently in children, though they are also susceptible to mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorders. Young children who have survived sexual violence commonly display abnormal behaviors such as eating disturbances, developmental regression, language delays, or attachment disorders. Over time, sexual violence in conflict zones has received the needed attention it deserves.",

At age 68 about 70 per cent of men still regularly partake in sexual activity, and even at age 78 about 25 per cent are sexually active. For men, the married state is not a necessary factor, whereas for women it makes all the difference. Very few unmarried older women report regular sexual activity. Unavailability of a sanctioned sexual partner is the chief determinant. The ratio of available older women to available older men may approach 4:1 in many environments. Sexual expression requires privacy, an aspect of life that is often neglected for the aged. The physician should take these needs into consideration when counseling or when planning programs to improve the quality of life in the later years.",

Although it does not involve direct violent behavior, behaviors such as disturbing frequent phone calls, text messages, waiting and keeping watch around the workplace, university or home are among the persistent stalking behaviors. Persistent stalking can lead to an increase in the victim's feelings of fear and anxiety. Individuals exposed to this situation may experience psychological and/or physical health problems. According to researches, persistent stalking is a sexist act. The victims are mostly women. Stalking actions are generally carried out by men whom women know and have emotional relationships with. The difference between being a perpetrator or a victim in stalking actions depending on gender change also causes the formation of stalking myths in countries. In this study, stalking, which is a very current concept in the field of forensic sciences, was examined in terms of some sociological variables. Stalking and gender, the effects of honor culture and the meaning attributed to stalking in terms of gender were examined.",

Erectile and orgastic spectatoring were frequent after stroke and were in the males significantly associated. Retarded ejaculation occurred for no males before but for 15% after the stroke. Marked decreases in different kinds of caressive behaviour were followed by discontentment and up to and about half the subjects felt that sexual partnership responsiveness had deteriorated. After the stroke the commonly occurring reduction in general sexual satisfaction was significantly associated with symptoms of increased sexual dysfunction, disturbed partnership responsiveness and reduced sexual fulfilment. The high prevalence of sexual maladjustment in stroke victims appears mostly to be psychogenic. Important precipitating factors are performance orientation and sexual stigmatism. Moreover, lack of sexual information and counselling may contribute to deterioration of partnership sexuality.",

      "title": "Psychologic Implications of Scrotal Sac and Testes for the Male Child",
      "abstract": "The uncontrollable retractability of the testes during cold, fear, anger, sexual arousal, and defecation is the basis for castration anxiety and fear of object loss including body parts. The scrotum is associated with the anal area, which is considered \"dirty,\" leading to the concept that sex is \"dirty.\" Because of the fear that a testicle can fall off, boys tend to achieve bowel training later and with more difficulty than girls. Hor monal changes in prepuberty and puberty, which cause increased size and sensitivity, also increase the masturbatory urge. Feeling guilty about masturbation, a boy may think that he has damaged his sac and testes when he perceives that the left testicle hangs lower than the right, a normal state. In cases of cryptorchidism, both sterility and homosexual problems play an im portant role: physically, if bilateral, sterility and feminizing of the male ensue; psychologically, he develops a depression about his procreative inability and fears homosexual attack. Such attacks are more likely to happen to the cryptor chid boy. The pediatrician is urged to regularly examine the boy in various positions, particu larly before age six. We must caution the pediatrician that his tendency to make a cursory examination may be caused by fears of being accused of making homosexual overtures.",

Qualitative interview data with Lithuanians 6 months or more into their divorce processes suggest that divorcees experience marital dissolution as an interchange of three main processes: losing valued self-parts, a (re)birth of a more valued self, and hanging-self as being stuck in ongoing uncertainty with a need to protect valued parts of oneself. The theoretical and practical implications of these research findings are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Although normal expression of sexual desire is recognized as one of the important aspects of sexual life throughout the life course, older adults experience many barriers to expressing their sexual needs and desires. Thus, this study explored the barriers to the expression of sexual desires in older ages. A qualitative study was adopted with a conventional content analysis approach. Nineteen elderly males and females over 60 years participated in this study. Data were collected by semi-structured individual interviews until data saturation and concurrently analyzed via MAXQDA 10. Four main themes emerged from data analysis as the main barriers of expression of sexual desires in the older ages: existing stereotypes about sexual roles of older adults; declining emotional bonding and intimacy; experiencing a sense of sexual dysfunction; and unpleasant aspects about spouse and life. Older adults are not easy to express his/her sexual desires and believe that having sexual activities in the aging years might be considered inappropriate behavior. As a result, most older adults end up suppressing their sexual desires. Hence, geriatric health-care delivery systems should have a focus on how to provide the necessary consultations and support for older persons.",

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that such social engagement is so powerful that it can sometimes lead children to overestimate what has been shared. After having shared two objects with an adult in turn, 2-year-old children played with a third object the adult could not see. In three out of four conditions, the adult remained co-present and/or communicated to the child while she played with the third object. Children falsely perceived the adult as being acquainted with the third object when she remained co-present (whether or not she also communicated) but not when she clearly terminated the interaction by disengaging and leaving. These results suggest that when young children are engaged with a co-present person they tend to overestimate the other's knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Men's sexual overperception bias-where men tend to perceive greater sexual interest in women's behavior than actually exists-is a well-documented finding in previous research. All of the existing research, however, has tested this effect in the context of initial encounters or for fictitious or unknown targets. No research currently exists on how people perceive their romantic partner's sexual desire in the context of ongoing, intimate relationships. In 3 dyadic studies, we provide evidence that men in established romantic relationships err in the direction of the opposite bias and underperceive their romantic partner's sexual desire. We also demonstrate that this underperception bias is functional (particularly for men) in that it is associated with their partner feeling more satisfied and committed to the relationship. In addition, people are particularly likely to underperceive their partner's desire on days when they are motivated to avoid sexual rejection, and men's underperception bias is, in part, accounted for by men's higher general levels of sexual desire than women. The current studies extend previous findings on sexual perceptual biases and demonstrate the important role of context in men's judgments of a partner's sexual interest. (PsycINFO Database Record",

      "abstract": "Considerable research has established that particular partner characteristics have a negative impact upon marital quality and that marital distress often results from the failure of partners to resolve personality differences. This study assessed personality and interpersonal differences related to marital distress within 92 clinical couples. Husbands in marriages of 6 years or less reflected distant, apathetic, hostile, and domineering features, while their wives reflected a greater need for attention and stimulation. Husbands in marriages of 7 years or more reflected greater distant and apathetic, self-focused, hostile, and domineering characteristics, while their wives reported greater passive dependency. The shorter married wives’ and husbands’ marital distress was most strongly associated with their own avoidant and self-defeating characteristics. The longer married wives’ marital distress was associated with their husbands’ dominant and self-involved characteristics. The longer married husbands’ marital distress was most strongly associated with their own dominant and self-centered characteristics, but with none of their wives’ characteristics. Partner ratings supported interpersonal theory expectations that distressed couples would reflect noncomplementary interaction patterns. Marital therapists may increase the likelihood of remediating/preventing marital distress by helping couples to recognize that their own and their partner’s personality traits, and interpersonal styles can be linked to marital distress, that these links seemingly differ for males and females, and that these links are likely to change over the marital life cycle.",

Prior to the nineteenth century, very little was written on the subject of child maltreatment. The legal and philosophical definitions of child abuse and neglect are fairly similar. In both legal and philosophical contexts, child abuse is generally defined as physical, emotional, or sexual harm done to a child. Abuse generally denotes the active harming of a child. On the other hand, child neglect is an act of omission in which a parent, guardian, or other individual responsible for a child's well‐being has failed to provide some predefined notion of adequate care. In large part, the definitions of child abuse and child neglect depend upon what types of treatment children are entitled to receive. Writers on children's rights have proposed a wide array of answers to the question of what children are owed. These answers range from defining a minimum standard of care that must be met to arguing for a fairly demanding maximizing standard.",

Men in romantic relationships (N = 512, in predominantly mixed-gender relationships) reported on sex they had with their partner in the previous month. Indirect effects indicated that penis appearance concerns predicted greater spectatoring, and in turn predicted greater erectile and orgasmic dysfunction. Results suggest that spectatoring is a conduit through which penis appearance concerns impede sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Homosexually active men and women are no more immune than anyone else from various types of sexual dysfunction and underlying psychopathology. Intimacy fears and conflicts, ignorance, alcohol and drug dependence and relationship issues exemplify the type of issues influencing dysfunction regardless of sexual orientation, although membership of a stigmatized minority sexuality may exacerbate causes of sexual dysfunction. The effects of discordant lifestyle and identity, homosexual identity formation, dysphoria and internalized homophobia on sexual functioning are three examples of these factors of specific relevance to being homosexual in this culture. The effects of AIDS, difficulties arising from the mechanics of safer sex and the psychosexual effects of oppression on healthy sexual functioning all indicate how factors important to (but not caused by) minority sexuality status may influence sexuality functioning. The importance of neither perceiving homosexuality solely in terms of pathology on the one hand, nor refusing to recognize unhealthy sexual functioning on the other, is emphasized throughout. Models of sexuality must be inclusive, positive and communicated to the client if future sexual dysfunction is to be limited. Finally, the role of the therapist in community development, as well as individual intervention, is addressed. Primary health care interventions are required not only to address the specific issues affecting homosexual men and women, but also to promote a more positive approach to sexuality for all.",

Some have endured gross insensitivity, disrespect, indifference, imbalance in give-and-take, or ingratitude.

Sometimes we become unusually dependent on those who have died-to the point at which some of us have merged our identities with theirs, deferred to them on almost all decisions, or allowed them to manage nearly all details of our lives.

Once situated, they can abuse children for decades without deterrence in spite of the fact that individuals around them may be aware–or partially aware–of their behavior. This article examines three cases, one involving a priest, another a football coach, and the third a pediatrician and considers the institutional practices and cultures that permit (or potentially permit) abuse and exploitation to flourish. Among other things it finds: confidentiality mandates and other codes of silence and secrecy impede information sharing; departmental or programmatic silos exist each with their own independent and competing agendas; confused reporting lines within the institution often end in the hands of powerful individuals who have an interest in non-disclosure; barriers exist to investing within the institution and reporting outside the institution often including mistrust and disempowerment of law enforcement and child protective services; extreme power differences exist between and among victims, predators, reporters, and other institutional players; and finally, intense loyalties personal, professional, and institutional are present. These factors produce institutional cultures that protect pedophiles and conspire against their vulnerable, individual, child victims.",

      "abstract": "Why did more or less continuous female sexual receptivity emerge in human evolution? This paper suggests a tentative answer that is partially supported by evidence from a random sample of mammals and birds. The cross-species evidence suggests that species have year-round sexuality only if they live at low latitudes and have a dependency period longer than six months. We suggest that humans might have developed continuous female sexual receptivity, rather than other mechanisms that distribute sexuality throughout the year, because our species has the unusual combination of long infant dependency, group living, and male-female bonding.",

      "title": "Alcohol, Eroticism and Sexual Performance: A Social Interactionist Perspective",
      "abstract": "Impotence and reduction in libido among chronic alcoholic men has been seen to be primarily caused by physiological changes resulting from constant and heavy drinking. Studies of this phenomenon have focused on males, amount of intake, and the correlation of alcohol ingestion with effects on bodily functions, to the exclusion of three social factors that may be a significant part of the sex act: First, the attitudes and behavior of the sex partner of the drinking male as they affect interaction between the two; second, sexual arousal has been studied as an “encapsulated” act, rather than a part of the process of negotiation between partners which may culminate in intercourse; and third, the focus of research on impotence is restricted to the realm of sexual activity, ignoring other aspects of the relationship an alcoholic may have with his sex partner. Additionally, the sex problems of men in marriages (or with sex partners) where alcohol is not a problem is seldom compared with alcoholic men to see if they differ substantially in this area. In a study designed to explore the impact of these social factors on impotence, 76 wives of alcoholics, 28 alcoholic husbands and a control sample of 63 wives and 46 husbands in marriages where alcohol is not a problem were interviewed in depth about their sexual relationship and about other areas of their marriage which surfaced as the most troublesome for wives of alcoholics—companionship, meals, and recreation. Findings suggest that a good portion of the erotic reduction and performance problems that alcoholic men experience are much more complex than physiological decline alone. A complex amalgam of rejection by their partners, which is influenced by the dynamics of their relationship in other areas of the marriage, as well as their different perspectives on what sort of behavior is a suitable prelude to intercourse can be seen to affect sexual interest and/or performance.",

In this sense, this study arises with the intention of determining the sexual health culture in sexually active adolescents. For this purpose, a qualitative, phenomenological type of research was carried out, in which interviews were conducted with previously structured open-ended questions to 4 adolescents who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After collecting the information, the results were subjected to analysis and interpretation through the process of categorization and coding, having obtained that: sexually active adolescents have little information on sexual health, sexual practice is generally monogamous, early onset, product of peer and acquaintance pressure, coupled with curiosity; there is condom use; however, the information comes from various sources and scarcely from the health unit.",

Previous literature has, however, primarily investigated first heterosexual sex, overlooking important contextual factors specific to same-sex/gender sexual experiences. Seventeen in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority (LGB+) individuals, ages 18-23 years. Four themes emerged from thematic analysis of reported thoughts, affect, and behavior. First, participants reported difficulty defining sex between same-sex/gender partners, especially women who reported that this undermined their personal relationships and identity. Second, participants met partners through several means; however, it was almost exclusively men who reported meeting their first partners online. Third, motivations for first same sex/gender sex included affirmation of personal sexual identity, sexual exploration, social expectation, and spontaneity. Fourth, participants felt underprepared for their first same-sex/gender sex, noting that their earlier sex and relationship education had not included information on same-sex/gender sex or LGB+ identities. Consequently, participants reported relying on experienced partners and seeking information on the internet, including pornography and social media. Greater cultural representation and more comprehensive sex education that recognizes sexual diversity is needed to better prepare LGB+ young people for early sexual encounters.",

      "abstract": "Background It used to be called ‘impotence’: a double-edged label, with its implication not only that the man is unable to persuade blood into his penis, but also that he’s powerless in sexual situations, in the relationship arena, and in life. The word was never just a medical description; it always held undertones of accusation – a word to be hurled across the room during late-night arguments. How preferable that we now use the term ‘erectile dysfunction’ (ED): descriptive, non-judgmental, and with no misunderstandings. Problem is, there’s still a misunderstanding here, and a serious one at that. We still think that ED is only about the man, his penis and his problem. Wrong. Yes of course the man suffers – and deeply. It’s not just the day-to-day lack of sexual performance, not just the panic that normal service will never be resumed. It’s also the low self-esteem, the failing confidence when he compares himself with other men. It’s the guilt at what he sees as failure towards his partner. And it’s the intimation if not of mortality, certainly of frailty and old age. ED can all too easily turn into a symbol of male helplessness and hopelessness, which is why the original ‘im-potent’ term struck disturbingly to the very heart of the problem. So yes, the man suffers. But what not only my postbag but recent studies 1 suggest is that the man’s partner suffers too. And that means that his ED can also become her (or conceivably, his) sexual and emotional dysfunction, and then become a relationship dysfunction rippling out through the whole of the couple’s lives.",

Je chapana předevsim jako zdravotni problem, spojený s vyssim věkem clověka. Inkontinence je vsak diagnozou, ktera postihuje jak ženy, muže tak i děti a negativně ovlivňuje jejich život. Je oznacovana jako stav, při němž clověk neni schopen sam vědomě regulovat odchod moci. Mocova inkontinence je spojena se znacnou tělesnou, psychickou, socialni a ekonomickou zatěži. U inkontinentnich pacientů dochazi casto ke ztratě sebeucty, k rozpakům, k naruseni kvality života a spolecenskeho styku. Lide se casto vzdavaji sveho běžneho životniho stylu. Dochazi tak ke zřejmemu poskozeni socialnich vazeb, partnerských vztahů, profesniho zařazeni a celkove spokojenosti. Unik moci je problem intimniho razu a ne vsichni jsme schopni a ochotni o něm otevřeně hovořit. Ve sve praci se zabývam klasifikaci, diagnostikou, lecbou inkontinence a inkontinentnimi pomůckami urcenými specialně pro muže. Pro praci byl zvolen kvantitativni výzkum. Byla použita výzkumna metoda formou dotazniku. Sběr informaci probihal ve třech ambulancich praktických lekařů v Ceských Budějovicich. Výzkumným souborem byli muži z Ceských Budějovic starsich 30ti let, kteři ve dnech 17.1.- 28.2. 2007 navstivili vybrane ambulance praktickeho lekaře v Ceských Budějovicich. Dotazniky byly podavany nahodně. Provedeným výzkumem se měla potvrdit ci vyvratit stanovena hypoteza, ktera zni: Muži nemaji informace o problematice mocove inkontinence. Výzkumem byla hypoteza potvrzena. Cil prace byl splněn. Výzkumem byla zjistěna skutecnost, že převažna cast dotazovaných respondentů by od sveho praktickeho lekaře uvitali vice informaci o problematice mocove inkontinence a že sami respondenti si mysli, že informovanost mužů o tomto problemu je nedostatecna. Dale z výzkumu vyplýva, že převažna cast respondentů nemělo nikdy k dispozici informacni material o mocove inkontinenci. V praxi bychom se měli zaměřit na zkvalitněni informovanosti, ktera by se urcitě zlepsila, kdyby se zvýsila výroba a distribuce brožur o inkontinenci a siroka veřejnost k nim měla přistup. Letaky by měli být volně k odebrani v cekarnach u praktickeho lekaře, tak i v geriatrických ambulancich. Dale by se měli zajistit edukacni programy pro klienty a prohloubit poznatky sester, aby byly schopne poskytnout důležite informace a pomoci lidem s mocovou inkontinenci. Zaroveň věřim, že i ma prace bude sloužit jako informacni material o mocove inkontinenci pro sirokou veřejnost.",

      "title": "Pornographic Films and Unconscious Homosexual Desires: An Hypothesis",
      "abstract": "The possibility that heterosexual behavior may serve to gratify unconscious homosexual desires has been noted. Blanchard (1959) , for example, discussed group rape and noted that the sharing of a female for sexual purposes in one another's presence might well gratify unconscious homosexual desires of the males cornmicting the sexual assault. Men who have certain heterosexual preferences (such as anal intercourse or female partners who have masculine characteristics) may also be gratifying unconscious homosexual desires. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a similar inference could be made about males who habitually attend heterosexual pornographic films. In a typical cinema in which pornographic films are shown, the audience is usually completely male, alchough no studies of the composiuon af audiences have been p u b lished. Most likely, a man watches these films in the presence of other men. If there is a period of live entertainment (dancing or sexual intercourse), the men typically move closer to the front for this, thereby sitting in close proximity. The content of pornographic films emphasizes close-up views of penises. Fellatio is prominent. All ejaculations are shown and the semen visible. There are also close-up views of the genital areas during intercourse. Aside from a few views of the female face and breast, the content is very similar to that of homosexual films, in which views of fellatio and intercourse also comprise most of the film. Heterosexual films also contain episodes in which one female services several males at one time, with a combination of fellatio, vaginal intercourse, and anal inrercourse. In these scenes, several men are sharing the same female, much as occurs in group rape, but of course without the use of force on an unwilling female. The audience, though not active participants, may be seen as passive participants. The theme of heterosexual pornographic films is that the males get pleasure. The females, though supposed to be enjoying the sexual activity, are used for male gratification. The films may be conceptualized as gloriFying the male penis and the male orgasm If it is correct to suspect that heterosexual pornographic films do gratify unconscious homosexual desires, then it might be hypothesized that males who habitually watch such films would give evidence of unconscious concerns as manifest, for example, in sexual impotency or on objective tests of unconscious homosexual desires that have been devised (Lester, 1974). Such studies have not yet been conducted.",

Age as an index of physical, cognitive, and social development has been found to be related to childhood sexual behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, a study of 2- to 7-year-olds found that older children were significantly more knowledgeable about aspects of sexuality such as sexual behavior, pregnancy, and sexual abuse prevention. Meanwhile, genital manipulation and masturbatory behaviors are more prevalent among boys, suggesting behavioral differentiation by gender. Factors other than gender and age that influence sexual expression in childhood have been investigated in only a few studies. Liberal parental attitudes regarding sexuality have been found to be associated with specific behaviors such as increased masturbation, frequency of touching parents' genitals, and frequency of sexual behavior overall.",

In addition, it is important for social workers to understand that men who simply have sex with other men, repeatedly and over time, may never identify themselves as homosexual or gay (Kinsey, Pomeroy, & Martin, 1948).

      "abstract": "In the forthcoming 5 th Edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), as in previous editions, there are two overarching types of sexual problems. The first type is the ‘sexual dysfunctions’. Animating this category, we would argue, is a concern to address sexual experiences and behaviours understood as insufficiently intense in duration, magnitude or frequency. The disorders included in the category are thus predominantly those associated with a lack of arousal or pleasure, or which are physically inimical to penetration. The second type of sexual problem is labelled ‘the paraphilias’. DSM-5 distinguishes within the paraphilias as a diagnostic category between ‘paraphilias’ and ‘paraphilic disorders’: the former are understood as merely abnormal whereas the latter are pathological and require correction. Organising the category of the paraphilias, we would suggest, is a concern with forms of subjectivity with illegitimate objects of sexual attraction or pleasure. This ‘point of view’ article sets out to explore and explain, with swift brushstrokes, the gendered logic underlying the delineation of pathological desires, pleasures and acts in the proposed sexual dysfunctions and paraphilias. Our focus is on changes from previous editions of the DSM. We shall contend that the proposed sexual dysfunctions and paraphilias utilise, refract and ultimately naturalise troubling societal assumptions about gender. Kristeva (1980 [1975]: 133) has argued that ‘the notion of heterogeneity is indispensable’ as a starting point for investigations of the logic of classificatory structures, and their role in organising and occluding relations of gender power. That is to say, confronted with a taxonomic system of forms of human life, Kristeva suggests that",

      "title": "Looked after and adopted children: applying the latest science to complex biopsychosocial formulations",
      "abstract": "Looked after and adopted children are among the most vulnerable in our society and it is well established that they present with a higher prevalence of mental health problems than children who live with their birth family. In their histories, they frequently have birth parents who have lived chaotic lives, some with mental health problems and substance misuse, and have experienced disruptions of care as well as exposure to neglect and/or abuse. However, often when they try to access mental health services, all their problems are formulated as ‘trauma and attachment issues’ with lack of data to support these. This article presents a case study of a 15-year-old boy whose severe difficulties were understood and formulated in terms of ‘attachment problems’ for many years. Neuro-developmental issues, unrelated to his being removed from his birth parents and adopted, had not been considered as the biological factors of the formulation (e.g. genetics and intra-uterus events) were ignored. Because there are no evidence-based interventions for a vaguely defined presentation such as ‘attachment problems’, he was given non-evidenced therapies for years and the parents felt blamed. Understandably, there was then little progress with his difficulties and this in turn had a very detrimental impact on his family, academic and social life. It is recommended that looked after and adopted children have their presentations formulated using a biopsychosocial model that takes into account their complexities to personalise future interventions, just like children who live with their birth parents. It is imperative they stop receiving mental health services where ‘one size fits all’ and that the training of staff working with this group ensures that children’s whole life experiences are understood.",

Resultados: Se han encontrado algunas descripciones sobre actitudes sexuales, en diversos pueblos con anterioridad al año 100 Antes de Cristo, y recién en el siglo XX se empieza a investigar la sexualidad desde el punto de vista científico, con los aportes de Balzac, Jung (1969) y Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Existen factores y mitos que afectan y están relacionados con la sexualidad del adulto mayor. La existencia de un declive gradual con la edad, en la actividad e interés sexual, en el caso de los varones se produce a partir de los 60 años, la actividad sexual más frecuente son las caricias y tocamientos, seguidas del coito, también se observa una mayor actividad sexual en las mujeres mayores que han tenido intensa actividad sexual en la juventud. Un alto número (74% hombres, 42% mujeres) practican la masturbación, la relevancia del sexo decae a partir de los 56 años de edad, llegando a considerarse como nada o poco importante en el 57% de las personas mayores de 65 años. Conclusiones: La sexualidad incluye todas las formas de expresión, desde la aproximación, el tacto, la intimidad emocional, la compañía, la masturbación y no solamente el coito. Es un aspecto importante que en la vejez debe continuar siendo una fuente de placer y no una fuente de inquietud y frustración.",

      "title": "Adolescent Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "There is a continuing nationwide concern regarding the high prevalence of adolescent/teenage/ school-aged pregnancy. The terms adolescent pregnancy, teenage pregnancy, and school-aged pregnancy all have been applied to pregnancy at an age and/or developmental stage that is considered premature or inappropriate, especially with respect to outcome. Whereas fertility is determined by biologic factors, the impact of pregnancy and its consequences have biologic, psychosocial, and environmental determinants. The term \"adolescence\" is applied to the period of psychosocial development from childhood to adulthood that corresponds to chronologic ages 10 or 12 to 21 years. Adolescent pregnancy has different implications for the 18- or 19-year-old high school graduate who is married or planning marriage than for the 13-or 14-year-old middle school student who may be beginning the process of adolescence. Although recognizing this broad spectrum, the Committee on Adolescence has chosen the term \"adolescent pregnancy\" for this and related statements. Our primary concern is the individual in early to middle adolescence (younger than the age of 18 years) who is biologically and/or psychosocially immature, and for whom pregnancy is, often unplanned, if not unwanted. Explanations for the high prevalence have ranged from inadequate sex education to sexual promiscuity. In this statement current research data will be reviewed and relevant information will be provided so that pediatricians and others responsible for the health care of adolescents can appreciate the implications and consequences of adolescent sexual activity and early childbearing. SEXUAL ACTIVITY The current problems resulting from teenage pregnancy cannot be appreciated fully without understanding adolescent sexual behavior and the secular changes that have taken place.",

The results of this study can be summarized as the following. First, either the exposure or stress of a woman's specific body parts like breast, waist, hips, or legs which can be sensed totally different from man's or the ironic disclosure of body parts always lapped around emphasizes femininity by giving full play the unique sexual beauty of a woman's body. Second, the desire of disclosure to have others' attention with the concealment as suggestive exposure expresses the eroticism. The modified eroticism is found different from the conventional concept and is based on the desire to make others notice one's existence continually by the sexual exposure dress particularly to entire the other sex, the dismantlement of changing an underwear to an outer-dress, and so forth. Third, both exposure of a woman's sexual body parts and expression of exposure to the utmost by laying a woman's entire body bare can mean sex liberty in the laissez-faire generation. This may suggest a pleasure-oriented way of thinking of the self-consolation rather than showing others, or feature the personality and the liberty endowed women with.",

Previous research has suggested that frequent users of pornography also experience signs of behavioral addiction such as loss of control over use and preoccupancy with thoughts of using. Research has also suggested that frequent users experiencing signs of behavioural addiction are more likely to copy or fantasize about imitating what the see in pornography. However, most research has shown that only individuals experiencing psychopathic personality traits are the ones who will imitate what they see in pornography. A study of 1,060 persons explored the effects of addiction to pornography, the dark triad and personality, and addiction to sex as contributing factors to the perpetration of aggressive or violent sexual behaviours. Persons with higher scores of psychopathy and problematic pornography use and compulsive sexual behaviours were more likely to behave aggressively sexually, but the findings also indicate that, regardless of personality, individuals experiencing lower levels of sexual satisfaction also reported more sexual aggression.",

      "abstract": "Sexual violence myth has a substantial influence on the occurrence/overcoming/signifying of, and response to sexual assault. This study starts from a critical view on how victims of sexual violence experience misconception in different relationships and under different conditions. We surveyed 235 victims and conducted 14 in-depth interviews to look into how they experience sexual violence myth depending on their relationship with perpetrators, their age when the incident took place, and whether the incident was rape or not. The results show that victims are more vulnerable to sexual violence myth during investigation or court trial, by people around them and media, especially when the victims are adult women, and they knew/were close with/went on dates with/had drinks with the perpetrators on their own will. Victims of sexual aggression by stranger or rape are relatively less prone to experience rape myth in which their sufferings are questioned, denied, downplayed, and even attributed to them. Damages of sexual violence cannot be measured objectively by its types. It varies depending on the relationships and circumstances surrounding the incident. Therefore, no one but the victim can define the damage and its significance for each case. Nonetheless, rape myth instigated by family members, acquaintances, and media, often during investigation/trial procedures, assumes that feelings suffered by victims/women such as discomfort, anger, false accusation, and betrayal, can be easily edited and altered. Impacts of sexual assault are not a matter to be accepted based on biased social misconceptions. It should be about how much the society can empathize with the challenges that victims/women face.",

      "abstract": "Separate lines of research show that men overestimate the extent of male peers' sexual activity, and independently, that sexually aggressive men believe that other men approve of coercive behavior. This study examined the intersection of these lines of inquiry, testing whether the degree of male participants' misperception of other men's sexual behavior differs as a function of perpetrator status. In a national sample, we presented heterosexually active men (n = 497) with sexual scenarios varying in sexual acts, partner types, and circumstances. Results showed that participants significantly overestimated the typicality of all types of sexual situations for other men. Participants also misjudged the desirability of scenarios consistent with a traditional masculinity sexual script to other men; these scenarios reflected an adversarial perspective on relationships and an impersonal approach to sexuality – a known risk factor for sexual aggression. Further, sexually aggressive men overestimated the desirability of these traditional masculinity scenarios to a greater extent than non-aggressive peers. Findings suggest that interventions that provide accurate knowledge about social norms, or \"typical\" sexual desires and behaviors among other men, may reduce pressure to live up to perceived but perhaps inaccurate masculine ideals, as well as reduce social norm-related risks for sexually aggressive behavior.",

      "abstract": "How do adults experience and manage their sexual desires, when these desires are laden with shame, guilt or religious transgression? This study looked at a group of 15 heterosexual, single adult men in the Orthodox Jewish community whose religious laws explicitly prohibit them from both masturbating and from expressing all forms of premarital physical intimacy. When these religious laws are internalized, the person can encounter a unique set of conflicts that can significantly impact his relationships, religiosity, and emotional well-being. Interviews focused on the different ways that men navigated these conflicts over the course of development. Findings point to 3 distinct conflict/defense positions that represent advancing developmental stages on the road to “sexual ownership”: (1) sexual disembodiment, during which the person’s desires are felt as irrational and senseless outside forces, split off from their otherwise purpose-driven self; (2) sexual internalization, where desire is felt as an anxiety-laden but tolerable part of the self, and the person manages his intrapsychic conflicts using a variety of mature defense; and (3) sexual integration, where the person accepts their sexual desire as an important part of the self that can be linked to other motives, needs, and conflicts. The factors that facilitate and obstruct the sexual ownership process are discussed. The generalizability of this process to other populations is considered, and clinical recommendations are provided for therapists who encounter sexual ownership problems in their patients.

Del calendario a las actitudes La descripcion de la primera relacion sexual ofrece tambien un punto de vista sobre el conjunto de la actividad sexual de los individuos. Actualmente, esta fase se desarrolla de forma muy distinta a la habituai hace cincuenta aňos. La edad media de las mujeres en el momento de la primera relacion se ha rebajado en mas de tres afios en medio siglo. No ob- stante, las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres no se han reducido con el curso de las gene- raciones. Para los hombres, este momento sigue siendo un paso del aprendizaje sexual, mientras que para las mujeres indica una primera relacion preconyugal o conyugal. Dentro de cada generacion, algunos individuos experimentan una entrada precoz en la vida sexual, mientras que otros experimentan una entrada tardia. Una entrada tardia en la sexualidad esta ligada a ciertos factores que retardan la maduracion social, como por ejemplo el hecho de seguir estudios de larga duracion. Pero una entrada precoz о tardia a las relaciones sexuales tambien es signo de una actitud determinada hacia la sexualidad, y de forma mas amplia ha- cia la pareja, y hacia la vida familiar. Los individuos sexualmente mas precoces tienen una vida mas compleja que los demas : el numero de separaciones a lo largo de su vida es mas elevado, y tienen un repertorio de practicas sexuales mas diversificado. Los que entran tar- diamente en la vida sexual tienen un perfil mas tradicional : tienen un numero muy inferior de parejas y habitualmente un unico conyuge a lo largo de su vida. Rechazan una separa- cion entre pareja, sexualidad y sentimiento. Estas diferencias de actitud y comportamiento son muy marcadas entre los nombres. En cambio, son menos marcadas entre las mujeres, especialmente entre las generaciones menos jovenes ; las mujeres tienden a asociar sistema- ticamente sexualidad y sentimiento.",

Children usually are not “repeat offenders,” whereas mentally handicapped or retarded persons frequently are. The latter individuals may be seen multiple times for foreign body ingestions and insertions. Normal adults may sometimes be subject to foreign body injuries because they are engaged in criminal activities, or because they are subjected to spouse abuse or child abuse.

      "abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse has been consistently associated with suicidal behavior. We studied suicide attempt features in depressed individuals sexually abused as children. On average, sexual abuse started before age 9. It frequently coexisted with physical abuse. Suicide attempters more often had personality disorders and had endured abuse for longer, but did not differ in terms of other clinical characteristics from non‐attempters. Earlier onset of sexual abuse and its duration were associated with more suicide attempts. However, when personality disorders were included in the regression model, only these disorders predicted number of attempts. The severity of sexual abuse and the coexistence of physical abuse were correlated with age at first suicide attempt. However, only severity of sexual abuse was marginally associated with age at first suicide attempt in the regression model. Finally, the earlier the age of onset of sexual abuse, the higher the intent, even after controlling for age, sex and personality disorders. This suggests that the characteristics of childhood sexual abuse, especially age of onset, should be considered when studying the risk for suicidal behavior in abused populations.",

There are two key aspects to emphasize in this definition: first, the sexual interest in children is persistent, and second, the children of interest are prepubescent and thus show few or no signs of secondary sexual development. This means that someone who has expressed a sexual interest in children or who has engaged in sexual behavior involving a child is not necessarily a pedophile. It also means that individuals who are attracted to sexually maturing children or sexually mature adolescents, even if they are below the legally defined age of consent, are unlikely to be pedophiles.",

      "abstract": "Puberty today occurs about 2 years earlier than it did at the beginning of the century. The age of menarche is now usually between 11-13 years, while the establishment of spermatogenesis and appearance of the 1st ejaculation usually occurs between 13-15 years. The ages at which adolescents feel mature, want to behave like adults, and initiate sexual activity are now lower than in the past. Sexual relations may occur between adolescents before they are fully capable of recognizing their consequences as autonomous and responsible acts guided by a system of moral convictions. Both marriage and parenthood may have unfavorable consequences for future personality development, sexual adjustment, and the personal-social adaptation of the individual. In Cuba, the persistence of traces of bourgeois mentality can be seen in the tendency to teach young girls false concepts of female behavior. Traits such as submissiveness, passivity, and fragility are stressed, and girls are taught to inhibit their sexuality from a very young age. Adolescent boys are expected to display virility and machismo. Adolescent boys may be so interested in the physical aspects of sexual activity that they deprecate the aspects, considering them to be weak female traits. Boys are more likely to separate the sexual object and the love object, while such duality is unusual in girls. Among the most serious problems of adolescent sexual activity in Cuba is a high rate of abortions among young adolescents. Some adolescents are promiscuous and have frequent changes of partner. The age group 15-19 years has the 3rd highest rate of syphilis and the 2nd highest of gonorrhea. The proportion of births to minors has increased from 22% in 1973 to almost half in some provinces. Divorce rates have been in constant increase in Cuba, and psychosocial immaturity of very young spouses is a principal factor in divorce. The widening temporal gap between attainment of puberty and marriage, which is likely to be postponed until the completion of ever more time-consuming educations, is a factor in increased premarital sex although it is not a determinant of it. An adequate sex education program would help adolescents develop responsible attitudes and good foundations for their future sexual adjustments. It would also help prevent adolescent pregnancy, with its frequent negative consequences.",

      "title": "Aging and sexuality.",
      "abstract": "Recent research suggesting that a high proportion of men and women remain sexually active well into later life refutes the prevailing myth that aging and sexual dysfunction are inexorably linked. Age-related physiological changes do not render a meaningful sexual relationship impossible or even necessarily difficult. In men, greater physical stimulation is required to attain and maintain erections, and orgasms are less intense. In women, menopause terminates fertility and produces changes stemming from estrogen deficiency. The extent to which aging affects sexual function depends largely on psychological, pharmacological, and illness-related factors. In this article I review the physiological sex-related changes that occur as part of the normal aging process in men and women. I also summarize the effects on sexual function of age-related psychological issues, illness factors, and medication use. An understanding of the sexual changes that accompany normal aging may help physicians give patients realistic and encouraging advice on sexuality. Although it is important that older men and women not fall into the psychosocial trap of expecting (or worse, trying to force) the kind and degree of sexual response characteristic of their youth, it is equally as important that they not fall prey to the negative folklore according to which decreased physical intimacy is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time.",

      "abstract": "The concept of intersexuality subsumes a wide variety of phenomena with very specific underlying causes. In all these cases, an untypical development takes place during the prenatal sex differentiation process becoming clinically manifest, either at, or soon after birth or at the time of puberty. It subsumes conditions in which biological sexual characteristics (e.g. chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, hormonal sex, morphological sex) differ from each other and one person cannot easily be assigned to one sex. One of the main goals of medical treatment of persons with intersex-syndroms is the development of a stable gender identity. Over the last few years, sex (and gender) assignment of persons with different forms of intersexuality has become a much discussed topic. An interesting--and very obviously observable--variable that was brought in connection with sex assignment is gender related childhood play behaviour. The purpose of the presented study is to examine 37 persons with different forms of intersexuality (disturbances of androgen biosynthesis, partial and complete androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis with 46,XY and congenital adrenal hyperplasia with 46,XX) with regard to gender identity and gender role behaviour in childhood. Not all subjects in the study group had developed a clear female or male gender identity. In contrast to previous studies, some persons with CAIS did not recall distinguished female childhood play behaviour and these persons did not show a clear female gender identity. In contrast to results from other studies, the CAH-affected girls in this study did not seem to recall masculinized behaviour. Further research is needed to guarantee better psychosexual development with good quality of life in individuals with intersexuality.",

Diskriminacija je neupraviceno postavljanje drugega v slabsi položaj glede na katero izmed osebnih okoliscin (spol, spolna usmerjenost, starost, rasa, vera ali prepricanje, invalidnost …). Da lahko govorimo, da je delavec diskriminiran, je dovolj, da se to zgodi enkrat, medtem ko mobbing pomeni dalj casa trajajoce trpincenje (psihicno, verbalno, fizicno). Da lahko govorimo o mobbingu, se mora neželeno ravnanje nad nekom izvajati najmanj 6 mesecev in najmanj enkrat tedensko. Vendar pa so posledice tako diskriminacije kot mobbinga podobne in se kažejo v slabsi storilnosti delavca, vse pogostejsi odsotnosti delavca z dela ter predvsem v psihicnih težavah delavca, osebni stiski.

Der Artikel diskutiert die Frage nach übereinstimmenden Persönlichkeitseigenschaften Betroffener und fragt nach Motiven. Anhand von Aussagen von 9 Personen werden Beispiele für auslösende Erfahrungen zitiert. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kindern waren die Betroffenen oft vom Anblick eines Behinderten fasziniert. Im Artikel wird untersucht, ob das entsprechende Körperteil häufiger Erkrankungen zeigte. Geschildert wird typisches Pretending-Verhalten. Geprüft wird, ob es Parallelen zu körperdysmorphen Erkrankungen (BDD), Fetischismus oder Wahn gibt. Diese fielen gering aus, in der Mehrzahl ist der Wunsch auf ein spezifisches Körperteil fixiert, die Betroffenen sind sich der Absonderlichkeit ihres Begehrens völlig bewusst und hadern mit dem Pro und Kontra. Sexuelle Motive fanden sich bei etwa einem Drittel. Einige der Befragten befanden sich in ärztlicher oder psychologischer Behandlung; dies brachte den Amputationswunsch nicht zum Verschwinden. Bei mehreren der unter BIID-Leidenden wechselte der Amputationswunsch von einer Seite auf die andere. Dieser Befund ist mit der gängigen Theorie einer ZNS-Läsion nicht erklärbar. Diese Menschen haben eher das Ideal eines „perfekten” Körpers, der einen Arm oder ein Bein nicht umfasst. Die meisten bewundern die Schönheit eines Stumpfes und sehen Amputierte als „Helden”, die trotz der Behinderung ihr Leben meistern. BIID ist keine einheitliche Störung, sondern man muss mindestens 3 Achsen trennen: 1. Stärke der neuronalen Dysfunktion, 2. psychische Komponenten (z. B. sekundärer Krankheitsgewinn) und 3. Intensität des sexuellen Interesses.",

      "title": "A Differential Analysis of the Subtypes of Unresolved States of Mind in the Adult Attachment Interview",
      "abstract": "Abstract Disorganized attachment is most prevalent among high-risk populations, such as maltreated children. Recent attachment literature has demonstrated that one of the best predictors of attachment disorganization is an “Unresolved” parental state of mind regarding a loss or an abuse in the parent's own attachment history. However, although classification in the Unresolved (U) category is always accompanied by specification of the type of trauma that is unresolved (loss, physical abuse, or sexual abuse), much of attachment research has focused on unresolved attachment as one category. The current paper reviews the empirical literature on the parenting outcomes associated with different subtypes of U. The literature demonstrates that parents who have experienced loss or abuse in childhood, which remains unresolved, exhibit atypical care-giving behaviors. Specifically, a history of loss or childhood sexual abuse is found to be associated with more passively withdrawn parental interactions, whereas a history of physical abuse is related to increased negative and hostile interactions. In addition, there appears to be differences in caregiving behaviors between parents whose underlying attachment state of mind is secure versus insecure.",

      "abstract": "“Sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing are essential if people are to have responsible, safe and satisfying sexual lives. Sexual health requires a positive approach to human sexuality and an understanding of the complex factors that shape human sexual behaviour. These factors affect whether the expression of sexuality leads to sexual health and wellbeing or to sexual behaviour that put people at risk or make them vulnerable to sexual and reproductive illhealth. Health program managers, policy – makers and care providers need to understand and promote the potentially positive role sexuality can play in peoples’ lives and to build health services that can promote sexually health societies.” – (WHO 2006) There is increasing number of cancer survivors worldwide. A lot of them experience sexual dysfunction for a long time which can last beyond ten years post treatment. Sexual dysfunction can occur as a result of any aspect of cancer and cancer treatment. Sexual functioning and/or satisfaction have been found to be of concern to many cancer survivors. Sexual function can be affected by physical or emotional trauma especially if the genitals are affected and can adversely affect the quality of life of the patients. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in males and disruption in the sexual response cycle (sexual desire, excitement, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and dyspareunia in women. There are differences in the pattern of sexual dysfunction between males and females as females may be able to cope better than males emotionally. Bonini-Colmano et al. (2007) noted that malignant diseases have a strong influence in quality of life, sexuality being one of the most affected variables. In their study to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in a cohort of patients with cancer and its relationship with the following: pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mechanisms of adaptation to stress, anxiety and depression, questionnaires were used which included treatment, adverse events, Zimong and Snaith depression and anxiety scale, sexual dysfunction questionnaire, coping strategies of Tobin David, Hopwood body image scale and the analogical visual test for pain evaluation. Sixty four patients were evaluated. Seventy two percent were women and median age was 50 years. Libido was absent in 50%; this was associated with gender (better in men; p=0,05) and the presence of pain (p=0,05) and fatigue (p=0,05) but not with age. All patients who had intact libido also had arousal and orgasms; this was more prevalent in men than in women and in subjects younger than 60 years. Arousal was absent in 47% of cases. Forty four percent of men had erectile dysfunction; this was present in all patients older than 60 years. Frequency of",

Pupil dilation was monitored among men and women viewing pictures of clothed men, clothed women, nude men, and nude women. Pupils dilated more to nude pictures than to the clothed pictures, regardless of the sex of the subject or the sex of the target person being viewed.",

      "title": "Masturbation—An overview",
      "abstract": "Masturbation is a topic of discussion among all the categories of people since ancient times. Masturbation refers to non-penetrative sexual stimulation of a person’s genitals, often to the point of orgasm. The stimulation can be performed manually, by other types of bodily contact (short of sexual contact), by use of objects or tools, or by some combination of these methods. Masturbatory habits amounting to masturbatory abnormalities are included in the Chapter V (F 65.8) of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems -10 under “Other disorders of sexual preference”. In later 1700, a forged association was made between masturbation and mental illness. Masturbation served for decades as catch all diagnosis for all types of medical complaints of uncertain etiology. During the late 19th century, investigations in psychology and sexology made it clear that masturbation is nearly universal. In Sanskrit, semen is known as ‘DHAT’; and in Susruta Samhita the disorder related to loss of this DHAT has been mentioned as ‘Shukrameha’ and also known as Dhat Syndrome. Kissing, masturbation and intercourse are the frequent sexual activities among adults. Even after a permanent sexual relationship has been established, masturbation remains as a healthy practice during the illness or absence of partner or when intercourse is unsatisfactory. In older age group Involuntary Masturbation may be a manifestation of stroke related Alien Hand Syndrome. Today, masturbatory act is considered as a healthy practice when done in private and an offence if done in the public in most of the countries.",

Most research has focused on physical pleasure, measured via frequency of sexual intercourse or orgasm. Increasingly scholars are exploring the emotional and relational dimensions of sexual satisfaction and examining more subjective measures. Behavioral and social scientists often apply evolutionary or rational choice/exchange perspectives to the study of sexual satisfaction, but life course studies are proliferating. Sexual satisfaction is patterned by gender, relationship status, sexual exclusivity, and expectations of relationship duration, but not by sexual orientation. Historically, women's sexual pleasure/satisfaction has been deemed more “unspeakable” than men's.",

Older individuals engage in less frequent sexual activity, including intercourse, than do younger individuals, and couples in relationships of longer duration engage in less frequent sexual activity than do couples in relationships of shorter duration.

      "title": "Factores psicológicos y socioculturales en la vida sexual de los adultos mayores / Psychological and socio-cultural factors in the sex life of older adults",
      "abstract": "La sexualidad desempeña un papel muy importante a lo largo de la vida, así que no existe motivo alguno para creer que con la edad desaparecen el interés o las prácticas sexuales; el placer no solo depende del aparato genital, sino también de toda una serie de excitaciones y actividades efectuadas desde la infancia, las cuales producen un placer que no puede reducirse a la satisfacción de una necesidad fisiológica básica, denominada como “normal” en el amor sexual. Por lo general, la sociedad relaciona más a la sexualidad con la juventud, alimentando muchos estereotipos negativos acerca de la sexualidad en la vejez. El objetivo del presente estudio es identificar los factores psicológicos y socioculturales que intervienen en la percepción de las personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 años de edad que viven en el poblado de Sabancuy perteneciente al Municipio del Carmen, Campeche. Para ello se utilizó el método descriptivo, no experimental con alcance cualitativo, con instrumentos: ficha de identificación, test bienestar psicológico y la satisfacción sexual en parejas de edad adulta media y edad adulta tardía, Inventario de Autoestima de Coopersmith, versión para adultos. El análisis de datos se realizó mediante un ordenador personal (PC) con herramientas tales como: manejador de bases de datos (Word) y hoja de cálculo (Excel). Los sujetos objeto de estudio fueron 50 personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 años de edad. En los resultados se encontró que la autoestima, considerada un factor psicológico, no intervino en su percepción de mantener una vida sexual activa, ya que la mayoría de la población manifestó tener autoestima alta, aunque estos no tienen una vida sexual activa, es decir, la autoestima no influyó de manera directa en la actividad sexual de los adultos mayores investigados. Se preguntó a los adultos mayores en estudio: ¿cree que es malo para la salud, especialmente en la vejez, la actividad sexual?, ante lo cual, 20 % de los hombres con rango de edad de 70 a 79 contestó en las encuestas que no es malo para la salud tener relaciones sexuales, pero que ya no lo realizan porque ya no es lo mismo; asimismo, se les preguntó si en la actualidad mantenían relaciones sexuales, y los resultados mostraron que 34 adultos mayores ya no tienen relaciones sexuales y 10 hombres sí tienen relaciones sexuales aunque ya no sea con su pareja. Al preguntar a los adultos mayores si consideran necesaria la penetración o coito para obtener satisfacción sexual, 13 de los adultos mayores varones respondieron que consideran necesaria la penetración para obtener satisfacción sexual. En conclusión, la creencia de que la edad y el declinar de la actividad sexual están inexorablemente unidos, ha provocado que no se preste atención suficiente a una de las actividades que provee mayor calidad de vida, la sexualidad. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las personas de edad avanzada son capaces de tener relaciones y de sentir placer en toda la gama de las actividades como sucede en las personas más jóvenes.",

The subject of sexual dysfunction is more widely discussed in the media as a result of newer therapies that have become available in the past decade. Therefore, men and women of all ages are seeking assistance to improve their sexual relationships. Male sexual dysfunction refers to a problem with one or more of the four components of male sexual function, i.e. libido, erection, ejaculation or orgasm, that interferes with the ability or interest to engage in sexual intercourse. Psychological and physical factors as well as drugs may affect male sexual dysfunction. Female sexual dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes, related to desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain disorders. This article focuses mainly on erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. However, it is important to remember that the sexual partner plays an integral role in the successful and effective management of the ED patient.",

One child, assigned as a boy, elected by age 12 to be reassigned as a girl. The other child, assigned as a girl, elected by age 11 to be reassigned as a boy. It was possible to overcome the psychologic handicap of their elective mutism, espe cially by the use, initially, of drawing, writing and modeling. These cases illustrate the general rule that proper weighting must be given to psychosexual differentiation and the sense of gender identity before a decision for or against sex reassignment can be valid. A sex reassignment can be success fully undertaken if it resolves incongruity between gender identity and assigned sex, or if the gender identity is ambivalently noncommittal. Otherwise sex reassign ment is contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "Most children at some time or other pick up swear words and go through a phase of using them profusely and, all too often, in inappropriate situations. Most, however, pass quickly through this phase and although, like most adults, they may continue to swear they do so mainly to relieve feelings of tension and frustration and only then in situations where such language is uncensured and inoffensive to those present. There is, indeed, a developmental pattern to the swear words that children use. Between the ages of around four to seven years children tend to use words associated with excrement (even indirectly in some cases; e.g., knickers). Often the delight in using them stems not only from the knowledge that they are forbidden, but also from a fairly precise knowledge of their meaning. The next stage is the use of sexual obscenities and the delight in using these stems from their reference to forbidden things or their power to affect or provoke adults, rather than from an awareness of their precise meaning. Finally, older children may use blasphemies widely and openly; e.g. Jesus Christ! There is much disagreement among adults as regards the use and nature of such blasphemies and a whole area of uncertainty surrounds them. When using these words older children are often testing out their positions vis-à-vis adults within an area of perceived controversy, but it frequently represents a growing awareness of what is or is not acceptable.",

Findings reveal that ejaculation was experienced as a complex and dynamic process with diverse emotions which were entangled. In addition, it was understood not just as a biological phenomenon, but there are broader social, cultural and medical discourses that shape how these men feel and reflect on their first ejaculation experience.

Though - according to the results of medicinal surveys - there is no biological limit for a satisfactory sexuality during old age, after personal interviews with 500 random sampled people the hypothesis was confirmed, that older people are often thought to be asexual. Especially older women, who in most cases have no more sexual relations, often believed sexuality in age to be inappropriate, indecent, perverse or even sinful. More than that it could be shown, that sexual inactivity of older people cannot be explained by detoriation of old age only - like illness or loss of partner -, but that the normative evaluation of sexuality is probably an important determinant also.",

But the situation presented by persons suffering from intellectual or communicative deficits or who are intoxicated is more variegated and complex. There is a danger that if incapacity in these spheres is defined too broadly, some people who suffer from mental disabilities or who drink for the purpose of making themselves less inhibited might be denied the opportunity to have genuinely consensual sex.",

      "abstract": "Sex offenses to children or young adolescents have become a growing public concern. Chemical castration is currently considered as the best available societal response to child sex abuse. It abolishes testosterone secretion, its effects are reversible and side effects are minor. It has been argued that offering convicted sex offenders with the possibility to be treated may be in contradiction with the bioethics principle of autonomy because the person has really no other choice -- the alternative is usually a lengthy confinement sentence. In view of this controversy, we explored lay people’s and physicians’ views regarding the acceptability of chemical castration. Fifty participants (among them five physicians) judged the acceptability of castration in each of 36 scenarios consisting of all combinations of four factors: aggressor’s age (21 vs. 41-year old); (b) victim(s)’ age (5, 8, or 14-year old); (c) aggressor’s psychiatric status (no psychiatric antecedents, suffers from sexual deviation, or recidivist); and (d) family’s attitude (hostile to any kind of castration vs. approve castration). Participants’ ratings of acceptability were, on the average, very high, and 68% of participants considered that chemical castration was fully justified in all the cases that were shown. A small minority (8%) considered that first time offenders of young adolescents, without psychiatric antecedents, should not be chemically castrated. Another minority position (24%) expressed doubts regarding chemical castration of first time offenders without antecedents but they never strongly opposed it. Implications for bioethics are discussed.",

      "title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ACUTE CONFUSIONAL STATE IN COLLEGE STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "An acute confusional state has been described, occurring in young adults in colleges in the Chicago Area with specific characteristics as to genesis, presenting complaints, onset, course, and treatment. Psychodynamic reconstruction is as follows: In childhood these patients were bound in an extraordinarily strong dependent relationship to their parents through guilt and fear, engendered by parental instability and disharmony. With subsequent dependent gratification and support these patients were able to achieve a conforming type of adjustment and gain success in academic and social achievements. However, in young adulthood when they attempted to find their own identity, through choice of heterosexual partner and choice of career, in the college environment, devoid of dependent gratification, their previous adjustment was inadequate to meet their needs. Sexual temptation or commitment led to guilt, which led to retreat. Retreat, in turn, led to shame and ridicule from the peer group. To avoid the shame, another attempt at conforming sexual behavior is attempted, and once more guilt, retreat and shame. In this way, either thrusts toward accomplishment or retreat from it are associated with anxiety. Under these circumstances, if the dependent gratification from parents is cut off due to their criticism or disapproval, the patient regresses to an early childhood fixation point, associated with primary anxiety, rage, and confusion, where he feels isolated, worthless, mistrustful and depressed. Recovery from the confusion occurs when the patient, who desperately seeks help, finds someone to lean upon. If inadequate help to meet his needs is found, introjection or projection of rage may result. Further study to delineate this confusional state would include: 1. Psychological tests for independent verification of our results, 2. biochemical tests to compare the chemical changes in this condition with that found in anxiety states associated with other conditions, 3. further understanding of treatment and preventive measures, 4. sociological study of the college community to elucidate factors related to the development of security in young adults in college, 5. study of the background (family as well as the community) from whence these patients came and 6. control studies on college students without confusion.",

Normal physiological changes with age affect erectile function and ejaculation in males, and the vaginal tissue in females. Psychological and social factors that affect sexual function in old age include the individual's degree of sexual activity throughout earlier life, the psychological resiliency in adapting to the altered physiological conditions, demographic factors, and society's attitudes towards sex in old age. Furthermore, pathologies that are more prevalent among the elderly can interfere with sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is a widespread problem with potential serious psychological and physical sequelae. The majority of the perpetrators of this abuse are known by the victim, and are often a member of the victim's household. Child sexual abuse most commonly occurs as a gradual progression from behaviors that are difficult to distinguish from normal caretaking or expressions of affection, to behaviors that are more physiologically invasive. This study begins to address intrafamilial abuse by surveying the opinions of professionals-child psychologists, child psychiatrists and pediatricians-regarding when selected behaviors, related to nudity, cosleeping and kissing on the lips become inappropriate. An interaction between child and parent gender was found for all investigated behaviors. The age at which behaviors related to nudity and cosleeping were said to become inappropriate was younger for different-gender parent and child than for same-gender parent and child. The opposite was found for kissing. Examination of respondent characteristics found that those professionals who are younger, do not have a psychodynamic orientation, or are from the western states generally respond that the investigated behaviors become inappropriate at later ages than those who do not have these characteristics. In addition, although psychologists and psychiatrists were not found to significantly differ in their responses, pediatricians generally responded with a significantly older age cut-off than did either of the other two professions.",

Identity formation during adolescence is strongly affected by hormonal/body changes, the effects of culture and society, and cognitive and emotional difficulties. For adolescents, the new changes happening in their bodies can be overwhelming. Many things must be considered in a psychodynamic formulation that come to the fore in adolescence. For example, one's sense of gender is generally consolidated much earlier. Sexual identity may be somewhat fluid for adolescents, and experimentation is the norm. Adolescence may also be the time when cognitive and emotional difficulties first appear. Many factors can disrupt identity consolidation in adolescence. As always, traumas, family strife, and losses must be considered. A very common source of trouble in this area is drug and alcohol use disorders. Adult patients are likely to have strong memories of adolescence.",

According to their way of thinking, sexual activity diminishes after age 50 and ceases after age 60. Older people become the butt of many cruel jokes about the status of their sexual prowess; if some of them report sexual interest they are liable to be labeled “dirty old men” (or women). A 12‐year experience in working with geriatric residents of a nursing home has revealed interesting information which may be of some value in reassessing our concepts of the sexual needs of older people and understanding the appropriate modifications they may use to fulfill these needs.",

      "abstract": "Although stress, defined as the deterioration in homeostatic mechanisms in living things due to psychological, physiological, social, and even environmental reasons, has been mentioned since the 17th century, it is frequently encountered in modern life. So much so that you can be exposed to stress anytime, from home, business life, to the street, in traffic. This situation has made stress a part of modern life. Any situation or event, such as losing a close person, workplace stress, or even living in isolation at home during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, can also be a source of stress. Responses that occur in the organism to the stress stimulus are for the benefit of the organism up to a certain level. However, when the duration and intensity of the stress stimulus increase, pathological conditions occur in all physiological systems. Long-term exposure to stress may cause infertility in men by causing decreases in sperm parameters such as sperm quality, sperm concentration, spermatozoid count, and sperm percentage. Various substances are being researched to reduce these adverse effects of stress on the reproductive system. Studies have shown that melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and so on. It shows positive efficacy in male infertility with various mechanisms. This review it is aimed to give information on the effect of stress on the male reproductive system and the relationship between melatonin.",

      "abstract": "There is now considerable evidence that infants are surprised when shown impossible events that violate their beliefs about objects, as indexed by reliably greater looking times at these events than at possible events that are consistent with their beliefs. Do infants also attempt, as older children and adults do, to generate explanations for these impossible events? Data from our laboratory provide intriguing hints that infants, like older children and adults, strive to reconcile what they observe with what they believe. This evidence comes from experiments in which infants were presented with an impossible and a possible event and were found not to show the typical preference for the impossible event. Five examples are presented, involving infants aged 3 to 10 months, and ranging over several facets of infants' physical reasoning. It is argued in each case that infants' failure to look preferentially at the impossible event stems from their having arrived at some explanation for the event. In some instances, infants' explanations appear to be entirely self‐produced, as when infants spontaneously posit hidden objects to make sense of otherwise impossible events. In other examples, infants' explanations appear to depend on additional clues provided, either deliberately or inadvertently, by the experimental situation. Despite these superficial differences, however, the examples are all related in suggesting that infants, like older children and adults, actively seek explanations for inconsistencies in their world.",

      "abstract": "Addiction, which is one of the major problems of society and is spreading severely day by day, is considered a complex process where an individual develops an uncontrollable desire for a substance or behavior, continues this desire, and has difficulty ending it despite both physical and psychological harm. Food addiction is a type of addiction where individuals consume food not only to meet their physiological needs but also uncontrollably for emotional and psychological satisfaction. Individuals with food addiction tend to eat to cope with emotional states such as stress, anxiety, and depression, leading to unhealthy eating habits and weight problems. In such addictions, the treatment process requires addressing not only the improvement of physical symptoms but also the emotional and psychological factors that trigger the addiction. Although food addiction usually arises from depression or other psychological disorders, in some cases, individuals may feel the need to eat to feel better after experiencing abuse. This situation can become uncontrollable, leading to food addiction, which negatively affects both the mental and physical health of individuals. This study is a case study of a 41-year-old woman named S.A., who developed food addiction as a result of sexual abuse by her parent at the age of 13. The gradual progression of the abuse and the subsequent development of food addiction are examined in detail, along with the effects of EMDR and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) on overcoming the food addiction.",

Three main countertransferences that interfere with accurate identification of battered women are described: (1) counter- identification, (2)countertransference rage, and (3) countertransference helplessness. Battering men and battered women are found in all levels of society, although younger, lower income, less-educated men who have observed parental violence in their own home are at higher risk of abusing their spouses. Additionally, antisocial personality disorder, depression, and/or alcohol and drug abuse increase the risk of male violence in the home. Contrary to popular belief, the husband-to-wife violence is usually motivated by his need to control her rather than a result of his loss of control. Battered women show no consistent prebattering risk markers, except for a history of parental violence in their family of origin. Violence against women by their male partners is a serious public health problem that has not been adequately addressed by the medical and psychiatric professions. Myths and clinical realities of battered women are described and detailed recommendations for clinical inquiry and evaluation of level of danger are given.",

It appears that the social and emotional surroundings of the child, provided that they were continuous and devoid of ambiguity, play a prominent role in this process. At present, numerous authors consider that gender identity is achieved at about 2 years of age when the child has a harmonious general development.

Its considerable risk factors for developing psychopathology lie not just in childhood and adolescence, but also into adulthood. Child sexual abuse is highly under-reported in India, which has attained epidemic proportions. It is still seen as a taboo, creating a sense of discomfort where most communities try to hide, ignore, or mistrust the accusations. In healthcare, it thus becomes paramount to understand the warning signs, the likelihood of revelation while interviewing, and the dynamics of the family about culture and implications that can come along with the abuse.

In this paper, we investigate whether this preference was shared by 4‐ and 6‐year‐old children as well as chimpanzees, humans’ nearest primate relative. Neither chimpanzees nor 4‐year‐olds displayed a scarcity preference, but 6‐year‐olds did, especially in the presence of competitors. We conclude that scarcity preference is a human‐unique preference that develops as humans increase their cognitive skills and social experiences with peers and competitors. We explore different potential psychological explanations for scarcity preference and conclude scarcity preference is based on children's fear of missing out an opportunity, especially when dealing with uncertainty or goods of unknown value in the presence of competitors. Furthermore, the results are in line with studies showing that supply‐based scarcity increases the desirability of hedonic goods, suggesting that even as early as 6 years of age humans may use scarce goods to feel unique or special.",

For example, if an individual experiences harassment for their sexual and/or gender identity, they may experience feelings of distress and be more reserved with public displays of affection with their partner. As such, one romantic partner’s experience of minority stress can impact both they and their partner’s experiences. Relationship maintenance behaviors, such as communicating and coping with the stress together with one’s partner (dyadic coping), have been identified that may help mitigate minority stress’ deleterious effects. Dyadic coping is a process that conceptualizes how partners cope with stress in the context of their relationship, identifying how partners communicate their stress and the respective coping behaviors. Finally, there has been an insurgence of relationship education programs designed to help LGBTQ+ couples identify and cope with experiences of minority stress. For example, the Couples Coping Enhancement Training–Sexual Minority Stress incorporates the unique experiences of sexual minority couples to help couples improve (minority) stress management; enhance their ability to cope as a couple; sensitize both partners to ideas of mutual fairness, equity, and respect; improve communication; and improve (emotional) problem-solving skills.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Male erectile disorder (ED) impacts the sexual functioning of ten to twenty million men in the United States. Erectile disorder, as withother sexual dysfunctions, may be caused by, or associated with a number of diseases that impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, men who have few physical problems may also experience the disorder due to psychological factors. Men who suffer from ED due to psychogenic factors are believed to differ from functional men in five key cognitive and behavioral domains. Barlow and Sbrocco (1996) used these differences to formulate a model of male sexual dysfunction that explicitly addresses the cognitive mechanisms involved in ED. The model proposes that a key point in the development of ED is whether or not a man feels challenged or threatened when experiencing a discrepancy between expected and actual performance. Men who are challenged by the experience typically have the skills necessary to identify and alleviate the discrepancy in performance. They are believed to use positive outcome expectancy and confidence to overcome suboptimal sexual performance and maintain function. In contrast, men who are threatened by discrepancies between expected and actual performance may expect a negative outcome and have little faith in their ability to sexually perform.",

The child victim of sexual abuse, may be initially seen with specific or nonspecific signs and symptoms of the abuse. Moreover, these manifestations may be physical ailments directly referable to the injury, or, more commonly, they may represent symbolic behavioral manifestations of the injury.

Se admite hoy en día que más de un tercio de las mujeres ha padecido violencia (psicológica, física o sexual) en algún momento de sus vidas. La violencia sexual es la versión más extrema de violencia contra la mujer y concurre usualmente con los otros dos tipos de violencia. Se puede presentar en todas las etapas de la vida y ni siquiera el embarazo constituye un factor protector. Las personas más cercanas a las víctimas (pareja actual o anterior, sus familiares o personas conocidas), generalmente con poder sobre ellas, son los perpetradores más comunes. Se puede identificar algunos factores asociados, como el alcoholismo, la ignorancia, la permisividad social, la mala relación entre las parejas, el uso de drogas y otros. Las consecuencias pueden ser inmediatas o de corto, mediano y largo plazos y se dan sobre la salud física (suicidio, homicidio, muertes derivadas de sida o por complicaciones del embarazo; lesiones leves y graves, infecciones pélvicas y de transmisión sexual, embarazos ectópicos, embarazos no deseados, abortos espontáneos o inducidos, peso bajo al nacer) y mental (depresión, ansiedad, síndrome postraumático, síndrome posviolación, trastornos del sueño, obesidad, consumo de alcohol, drogas y tabaco y conductas sexuales de riesgo, entre otras) y tiene también impacto social (costos derivados de la atención de la salud y de la atención legal, implicancias sobre la productividad y el empleo). Por las graves repercusiones que tiene la violencia sobre las mujeres y la sociedad en general, debe ser enfrentada con información, educación, trabajo con grupos de varones y mejor preparación de los servicios de salud, apoyo legal y social.",

      "abstract": "An extensive series of papers by Brody and co-workers using questionnaires have correlated penile vaginal intercourse (PVI) and clitoral stimulation with various female functions and malfunctions. A major claim is that only PVI ‘competently performed and sensitively experienced’ leading to orgasm is ‘associated with, and in some cases, causes processes associated with better psychological and physical functioning’. Clitoral stimulation to orgasm per se or to facilitate orgasm even during PVI, however, is not beneficial to women’s, psychological, interpersonal or behavioural health and can lead to ‘noxious consequences’. Recently, as correlations are no guarantee of causation, independent studies have not confirmed some of their claims. The present review examines critically and rejects :- the demonising of the clitoris as an organ inducing ‘deadly pleasures’ or that it should become vestigial by self-creating a ‘psychological clitoridectomy’, that evolution ‘rewards’ PVI but punishes clitoral stimulation, that cervical buffeting is normally involved in PVI-orgasms or that a longer penis facilitates these, that orgasm is involved in sperm transport and thus reproductive fitness, that prolactin released at orgasm is an instigator of sexual satiation, that the coital alignment technique does not involve clitoral and periurethral glans stimulation by the penis and that women who cannot have orgasms induced by PVI alone are sexually dysfunctional and that their male partners are sexually inadequate.",

Parents reported that misconceptions were common among 3- to 6-year-olds, particularly for reproduction and death. Parents reported a greater reluctance to talk with their children about death and reproduction and also thought their children should learn about these concepts at a later age than other biological concepts. One third of the misconceptions reported by parents occurred at the boundary between different domains, where information from another domain (i.e., physics or psychology) was incorrectly associated with the biological domain. Parents of 5- to 6-year-olds reported fewer misconceptions than parents of 3- to 4-year-olds, suggesting that these misconceptions are open to change and are eventually replaced by accurate biological knowledge.",

      "title": "Gendering innocence: An empirical inquiry into the lived experience of gender incongruence in childhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gender diversity in childhood has become an issue of significant public debate in Britain. Growing concerns have amassed around the exposure of children and adolescents to new forms of gendered knowledge and expression, arousing discourses of childhood ‘vulnerability’ and ‘innocence’. These ideas draw on a specific framework for understanding ‘childhood’, in which children are depicted as passive, dependent and in need of protection, as they follow a universal, predetermined developmental pathway. Among other effects, this has resulted in a dearth of empirical research that has explored gender diversity as a developmental experience in childhood. This article draws on evidence from interviews with 40 gender and sex variant young people and 30 caregivers of transgender children. Participants' accounts illustrate the deep psychic investment in embodied gender incongruence that young people may manifest from the earliest years of childhood. They highlight the profound distress sometimes experienced by children denied external recognition of their internal (gendered) selves and required to conform to extraneous expectations informed by essentialist understandings of biological sex. Far from ‘innocent’ of gender (difference), children can be deeply and actively involved in creating and adopting gendered subject positions, sometimes generating unanticipated forms of diversity.",

      "abstract": "Whilst one would not expect the incidence of male rape to approach that of female rape in our society, the finding is that it is not so rare an event as would appear from the reported incidents. Unfortunately, the underreporting of the crime supports the general acknowledgement as established fact that rape is almost exclusively a crime against women and children.\nThis is extremely unfortunate, as the effects of male rape are manifold and far-reaching.\nMale victims make it clear that the rape on its own is stressful. This strain is then exacerbated by the scepticism of family members, peers, police and the judicial system.\nRape is commonly misconstrued to be a sexually motivated crime and it is assumed that males are unlikely targets of such victimisation. That he was a victim is sometimes linked to questions being raised around the victim's own sexual orientation.\nIt not uncommon for a victim of a rape to ejaculate during the assault. In misidentifying ejaculation with orgasm, the victim is often discouraged from reporting the assault for fear that his sexuality may become suspect.\nFurther disruption in the male victim's lifestyle has been evidenced by eating and sleeping disorders, psychological reactions, drug and/or alcohol abuse, social reactions, and sexual changes.\nFinally, there is the reality of rape trauma syndrome symptoms.\nUnder South African law, rape is, by definition, gender specific. Despite the Constitutional guarantees to equality, as far as men are concerned in South Africa, the law of rape does not apply. In an attempt to remedy the dissonance, the South African Law Commission was tasked with developing relevant legislation. In its final proposals it has presented for approval, a definition of rape consonant with the Constitutional guarantees is being put forward.\nOther international jurisdictions have already introduced similar legislation.",

Thematic analyses focused on individuals who recalled a specific age and event in early childhood in which they became aware of their gender and sexual identity versus individuals who did not recall a specific age tied to their awareness of their sexual and gender identities. Results showed that five participants gave non-specific ages (e.g., “always” and “at an early age”) when their gender identity became particularly salient, the remaining 6 participants reported a specific age and typically a specific event when their gender identity became particularly salient. Findings are discussed in the context of intersectionality, gender and sexual identity development, and the coming out process. Findings suggest that experiences related to gender identity and expression and sexual orientation are non-linear processes that vary widely, and that there is no one “master narrative”. Implications for mental health and the need for ongoing support services are also highlighted.",

However, little is known about whether this experience is more or less harmful in distinct phases of the life course, consistent with the life course principle of timing; or whether, in accord with the principle of lifespan development, it has long-term implications. We draw on longitudinal data addressing perceived workplace discrimination based on race/ethnicity and gender from the prospective Youth Development Study, covering early adulthood to midlife. Hierarchical linear modelling of the effects of discrimination on depressed mood indicates that both forms of discrimination have short-term (within life stages) and long-term (across stages) adverse effects on adult mental health. The impacts of perceived discrimination within stages on depressed mood appear to be greatest in the mid-30s and to weaken by midlife. Lingering effects of discrimination are more pronounced early on. These patterns are observed with controls for key time-varying negative experiences at work and personal socio-economic status, as well as invariant background characteristics (gender, race and parental socio-economic status). We consider these findings in relation to the dynamics of personal change in the context of occupational careers.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Why do we care whether the menopausal woman engages in – let alone enjoys – sexual pleasure or not? It is surely a very individual area and should be addressed on an individual basis. Today, the majority of menopausal women are busy with work, looking after children and grandchildren and lead fulfilling, busy lives. Why not a great sexual life too? Design and Method: Retrospective analysis of peri and post-menopausal women, experiencing problems related to sexual dysfunction. Detailed sexual health history was obtained, detailing specifics around gynaecological and sexual health screenings and interventions. This gave rise to key factors that displayed sexual dysfunction elements, but once addressed, diminished or resolved the dysfunction. Results: It was found that the majority of women were guarded in discussing sexual problems from a psychosexual framework, however, it remained less challenging to subscribe to the perceived problem being a medical/gynaecological problem. Awareness of age-related health issues and discussion around this influenced appropriate management. Conclusions: Adequate baseline screening is a key concept to address practical impediments and discuss these from a normal aging process. A direct approach, practical information, engagement with the partner and awareness of options around sexual positions and exploration drive these consultations positively. Support and education via linking with a Clinical Psychologist during this process was found to be a key aspect to outcome.",

      "abstract": "Teenagers tend to be struggling with sleep deprivation and sleep debt built up over time as they shift into adult sleep-still ensconced in a world that is unable to accommodate their shift in sleep habits and needs. Changing sleep in teens results in their not becoming tired until 11 : 00 in the evening despite the fact that they have to get up approximately five to six hours later. Therefore, from a general perspective-by virtue of not being tired due to hard wired developmental changes in their sleep-all teenagers are boxed in by not being tired until later evening hours yet having to get up even earlier than they did in junior high years. Their sleep is limited by a lack of tiredness and society demands of school start times, automatically resulting in unfulfilled sleep needs and building sleep deprivation.",

      "title": "7709 Ovotesticular Difference of Sex Development: Prognostic Evaluation, Sex Assignment, and Ethics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Disclosure: X. Xu: None. Y. Lin: None. B. Shivanna: None. A. Lee: None. J.C. Hakim: None. D.G. Mann: None. L.M. Noll: None. P. Georgiadis: None. S.K. Gunn: None. L.P. Karaviti: None. Background: Our case provides the identification and management of a newborn baby with ovotesticular syndrome, which was formerly known as true hermaphroditism. The term was classically derived from Greek mythology in which the deity 'Hermaphroditus', merging with the nymph Salamis, embodied both male and female attributes. The term 'true hermaphroditism' is now avoided due to its stigmatizing connotations. Ovotesticular difference of sex development (DSD) is an exceedingly rare condition, occurring in fewer than 1 in 20,000 births. This condition involves the coexistence of functional ovarian and testicular tissue within one individual, presenting a challenge in sex assignment due to unpredictable gender development. Clinical Case: This is a single case of the presence of ovarian and testicular differentiation on one side and a transitional zone of mixed pattern. Prenatal genetic testing consistent 46,XX karyotype. Initial ultrasound at the outside hospital revealed a uterus and right testicle. The baby exhibited Prader stage 4 genitalia, with a palpable gonad in the right labioscrotal area and the left gonad not palpable. Prophylactic hydrocortisone was started due to concerns regarding NR5A1/SF1 mutation. Further evaluations, including genetic tests, hormonal assessments, urinalysis and kidney ultrasound for the WT1 mutation, and scrotal and pelvic ultrasounds, were conducted. The high-dose ACTH stimulation test ruled out adrenal insufficiency. The testosterone level was in the male range, and the HCG stimulation test further confirmed functioning Leydig cells. The postnatal karyotype was 46,XX, and chromosome microarray analysis showed no abnormalities. Our approach to this case was multidisciplinary, including our endocrine experts, urologist, gynecologist, ethicist, and psychologist. We discussed the fluidity of sex assignment and addressed the degree of virilization, nature of the gonadal tissue, and emphasized the necessity of regular clinical follow-up. Our main concern was to educate the parents and protect the choices of the child. In this case, the child assumed a male sex assignment, as a result of the decision-making process between our team and the parents. In this context we did emphasize the fluidity of sex assignment. Clinical Lesson: Long-term outcomes for ovotesticular DSD remain understudied. Existing reports highlight varying rates of gender dysphoria, sexual function, and psychological well-being. Our approach to managing ovotesticular DSD involved a framework emphasizing ethical considerations and parental involvement. We advocated for and practiced a shared decision-making model involving healthcare providers, parents, and ultimately the patient. Presentation: 6/3/2024",

      "title": "Affirmative Psychotherapy with Bisexual Men",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY This article describes the range of issues that are of concern to bisexual men seeking psychotherapy. In addressing these issues with bisexual clients, the therapist is well advised to recognize the diversity that exists within this population regarding the pathways that individuals take in the course of acknowledging and coming to terms with their sexual orientation. It is important for the therapist to recognize that for most bisexual clients, the presenting issues are those that are common to most psychotherapy clients, such as anxiety, depression, stress, and relationship issues. For others, however, there are questions about sexual identity, coming out bisexual, and the implications of their sexual attractions to both women and men. An individual may have concerns regarding whether or not to disclose his sexual orientation at the start of a new relationship, or regarding realizing for the first time that he has bisexual feelings within an already established same-sex or other-sex relationship or marriage. There may also be questions and concerns regarding HIV/AIDS. In these situations, the personal impact of living in a social context in which sexuality is thought of in dichotomous either/or terms will be a realistic concern. Current trends in the research and clinical literature regarding bisexual men will also be discussed. The variety of manifestations of bisexuality across racial, ethnic, and cultural groups will be examined, including the challenges that this may pose for clients and therapists who identify with dominant definitions of sexuality within their respective social communities. Finally, the practical value and shortcomings of the main therapeutic schools will be examined in terms of providing bisexual men with effective and affirmative psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Discrimination and the Role of the Clinician",
      "abstract": "Recognizing and confronting discrimination is essential to eliminating health disparities. Healthy People 2030 highlights discrimination when addressing social determinants of health.1 In this issue of Pediatrics, Lei et al2 contribute to the growing literature that discrimination adversely impacts mental health in young adults. The authors investigated the effect of discrimination (racism, sexism, ageism, physical appearance, other) over time on mental health, substance use, and well-being. Data analysis using the Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics revealed that increased discrimination frequency was associated with higher levels of mental illness diagnosis, psychological distress, substance use, and languishing for up to 6 years after initial exposure.2 Clinicians should know 3 aspects vital to combating discrimination in health care: the impact of interpersonal discrimination, the role of implicit bias in perpetuating disparities, and decolonizing medical education and training.First, interpersonal discrimination (sometimes called individual discrimination) refers to conscious or unconscious acts of prejudice committed by a member of a dominant or privileged group toward a member(s) of a marginalized group. Acts of interpersonal discrimination (ie, microaggressions) can manifest as lack of respect toward a person as well as marginalizing, undervaluing, and scapegoating a person. Experiences with acts of interpersonal discrimination have been found to contribute to poor mental health and physical health outcomes in children, adolescents, young adults, and adults. Within the health care setting, this can include making disparaging comments to a patient or colleague about their weight, accented speech, name, or religious affiliation.3–6 Acts of interpersonal discrimination in health care also include failing to provide translation services for patients who are fluent in languages other than spoken English; making assumptions about a patient's intelligence on the basis of their economic status, educational level, or geographic origin; or refusing to see patients who are members of sexual or gender minority groups.7–9Secondly, acknowledging, mitigating, and eliminating the impact of implicit biases within the health care system is critical. Evidence suggests that clinicians endorse negative implicit biases toward race, sex, weight, age, and mental illness that are similar to those in the general population.10 Studies have found that clinicians' negative implicit biases influence how they communicate with their patients, influence the treatments they recommend, and influence patient satisfaction ratings.11 The Joint Commission report on implicit bias in health care suggested useful strategies for addressing implicit bias, including perspective-taking (the cognitive aspect of compassion that can reduce bias and deter unconscious stereotypes and prejudices), emotional self-regulation (experiencing positive emotions during patient encounters to build rapport, trust, and connection), and partnership building (working collaboratively with patients toward a common goal).12Lastly, we must address bias and discrimination in trainee curricula and continuing medical education. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) included in the Common Program Requirements that a trainee must demonstrate competence in \"respect and responsiveness to diverse patient populations, including but not limited to diversity in gender, age, culture, race, religion, disabilities, national origin, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.\"13 ACGME has 6 core educational competencies, but none specifically address bias, discrimination, and inequity. To fill this training gap, a new ACGME competency has been proposed: Structural Competency, Health Equity, and Social Responsibility.14 This includes 3 subthemes that address knowledge, skills, and attitudes: structural competency (eg, understand implicit and/or explicit race and/or gender bias and its effects on health outcomes, health inequities, and patient care), structural action (eg, incorporate direct interventions on patients' social and structural determinants of health into all physician functions), and structural responsibility (eg, examine the ethics of patient care decisions, with a focus on structural vulnerability and reducing the inequities faced by historically marginalized and oppressed populations).14 The American Board of Pediatrics has an updated entrustable professional activity for general pediatrics, number 14, entitled \"Use Population Health Strategies and Quality Improvement Methods to Promote Health and Address Racism, Discrimination, and Other Contributors to Inequities Among Pediatric Populations\" to address racism, other social determinants of health, clinician bias, and health inequities.15 This entrustable professional activity is focused on the following: clinician personal responsibility to their community and society, identifying populations at risk for poor health outcomes, cooperating with diverse stakeholders on creating and implementing initiatives to improve health outcomes, analyzing data from various resources for quality improvement and/or population health initiatives, and undoing the systems and processes that are rooted in discrimination that have led to health care inequities.15 To mitigate the influence of implicit biases on clinical decision-making, researchers from the Royal College of Physicians have suggested a checklist for determining if clinicians' biases influence clinical decision-making.16 This checklist includes items that analyze how one reached a diagnosis and whether stereotypes were used.16Interpersonal discrimination contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes for children, adolescents, and adults. Clinician biases and discriminatory actions in practice and/or in training against patients based on their demographic characteristics can lead to serious health consequences. Clinicians play a central role in recognizing and addressing interpersonal discrimination in health care settings and during patient encounters. Institutions have a responsibility of addressing interpersonal discrimination within the work environment and with patient care activities. Committing to reducing and eliminating interpersonal discrimination in health care will promote a healthier society.",

Our research aimed at complex recognition of sexual functioning, usual behaviour in all revealing spheres, normal aspects: dreams, imagining, masturbation, foreplay, coitus and sexual attitudes. 200 persons were sample in this research: 100 alcohol addicts and 100 persons of the control group. Following results were obtained: • dreams of sexual contents are rare both with addicts and other population, but significantly larger percent of alcoholics has “wet or orgasmic” dreams, • day-dreaming is less noticed with alcoholics, meaning that the need for raising sexual vigilance is reduced, • alcoholics masturbate more, they start to masturbate in later stage, • addicts rarely have foreplay and its duration is shorter, as a consequence of disturbed intimacy and impossibility of total harmony and exchange with a partner, • alcoholics have less sexual intercourses and feel different during them • there are no great differences in opinions about sex, • structural personal characteristics also have effect on sexual behaviour and alcoholism. Alcoholics have certain personal characteristics that clearly define them and which, because of their nature, influence addiction development and sexual behaviour. We can conclude from the research that a tendency in behaviour is evidenced, and for which can be said that it is \"pattern of sexual functioning of alcoholics\". Except difficulties in genital response, \"pattern\" refers to emotional component, meaning closeness or a level of intimacy with partner, as well as modification of \"normal” sexual aspects.",

Traditionally, this is explained by a learning process known as imprinting. Young birds are thought to imprint to early stimuli, causing the development of permanent preferences for those stimuli. In the present study, imprinting is examined with respect to behaviors of an adult human-reared pigeon in several conditions. The subject was either presented with no stimulus, a conspecific stimulus, a novel stimulus, a human stimulus, or the human and novel stimuli simultaneously. Several phases within these conditions were employed to pinpoint the variables that produced the most social and sexual behavior. The results showed that while some conditions produced unclear behavior, other conditions produced very clear indications of sexual preference for humans and fear of conspecifics. The results suggest that the concept of imprinting may not be needed to explain the sexual preference of the subject, and that operant contingencies may play a large role in sexual behavior.",

Indeed, without the sensations of pleasure and displeasure we would be unlikely to repeat or restrict behaviors. Since repetitive sexual activity over the millennia has ensured the continuance of the human race, it is perhaps surprising that pleasure has received little attention in the research literature on sexual function and behavior. By exploring sexual pleasure and motivation theories and studies relevant to the evaluation of sexual function and dysfunction, a goal response model is presented. This model proposes a route from sexual stimuli, via cognitive and emotional processing to behavior and subsequent feedback, which illustrates how eudemonic goals could influence treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A number of risk factors for sexual distress have been identified, including impairments in sexual function. However, for women, sexual function is only weakly associated with distress levels in many cases. One reason for this disconnect may be that impaired sexual function can have a variety of consequences for the individual's sexual experience and that some consequences may be more or less distressing to different people. Research suggests that some consequences of impaired sexual function may be more distressing to older women and/or for women in longer or less satisfying relationships. To examine the association between consequences of impaired female sexual function and distress, 75 women reporting one or more recurrent difficulties with sexual function in the past month were assessed. Frequency of sexual consequences including decreased physical pleasure, decreased sexual frequency, and negative partner emotional responses, were associated with sexual distress after controlling for the effects of sexual function. Additionally, a number of sexual consequences were rated as more distressing by older women and women in unsatisfying relationships. The idiosyncratic ways in which impairments in sexual function play out in the context of sexual activity may be an important target of future research and clinical interventions for sexual dysfunction. Keywords: sexual distresssexual functioningfemale sexual dysfunction Notes 1. This criterion may have biased the sample by excluding women who were unable to engage in sexual activity; however, the requirement was necessary given our aim of assessing the consequences of impaired sexual functioning that occurred during or immediately following sexual activity.",

      "title": "Permissiveness, Permission, and Aggression: The Effect of Adult Presence or Absence on Aggression in Children's Play",
      "abstract": "It has become conventional to think of an adult's permissiveness toward a child as representing neutralization of adult control. By behaving permissively (acceptantly, nonjudgmentally, etc.), the adult is thought to be freeing the child from his presence and authority, and in some loose sense to be permitting the child to behave as he would in the absence of any adult. Such thinking has emphasized the punitive or threatening aspects of adultchild relations. Adult permissiveness is seen as a way of reducing the child's fear of adult punishment and thus as a way of encouraging him to express in behavior those impulses whose expression he knows to be normally unacceptable to adults. Such thinking about permissiveness has been the basis for explanations which have been advanced for a frequent finding about aggression in doll play. It has repeatedly been observed that aggression in doll play increases over time or from session to session (i, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). This finding has typically been explained by reference to the adult experimenter's acceptant and nonjudgmental interaction with the child and the fear-reducing effect this interaction has. For example, in discussing recent evidence confirming the finding, Levin and Sears state that",

      "title": "Social trauma: The pathogenic effects of untoward social conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychoanalysis has traditionally overlooked the fact that unsuitable and damaging life conditions, originating in the social milieu, play a part in the pathogenesis of emotional suffering and mental disorders. Nonetheless, the self establishes an object relation with the social system, as well as with the non-human environment. This is expected to act as a container–contained relationship. Whenever the community and its institutions fail to act as a container for individuals and groups, this generates a trauma, which can be compared with the baby's experience of a failure in mothering. Such failures can be classified in several categories. The first is when the social system fails to contain, nurture, care for, and protect individuals, as in the case of the lack of assistance and compassion towards the victims of poverty, disease, natural catastrophe, social turmoil, economic crisis, violence, or war. The second category occurs when there is a blatant attack, on the part of the authorities or privileged social groups, on minorities, or even on the bulk of the population, as in the case of social repression, war—both internal and external—racism, genocide, or persecution. The third is when there is a perversion of the social system, which feigns to uphold current social values and laws while actually breaking them, as in the case of corruption, chicanery, and mendacity on the part of the authorities. One recent example of this is the impeachment process against the Chief of Government of Mexico City. The author approaches this problem by exploring the consequences of such experiences for the development and functioning of personality structure and personal relations, as well as their repercussions for individuals living together in the community and for the necessary relation between them and the authorities.",

This chapter reviews common military toxic exposures with known or perceived reproductive toxicity or effects on sexual health. Recommendations are made for assessing such exposures when evaluating military personnel or veterans suffering impaired intimacy or sexual functioning.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Twelve XXY boys identified at birth in a population screening study were followed up at a mean age of 16.7 yr and compared with a control group of chromosomally normal boys matched for age and social class. Assessment of personality and psycho‐sexual development showed the XXY boys to be more timid and less self‐confident and to have more problems in relating to their peer group than the controls. They also showed some evidence of delayed or impaired development of sexual interest. In general, the differences were not marked. Possible causes for these differences and potential methods of preventing them are discussed.",

      "title": "Identity Formation as Reflected in the Acquisition of Person Pronouns",
      "abstract": "Psychoanalytic theory on identity formation during rapprochement is enriched by considering psycholinguistic findings on person-pronoun acquisition. Pronouns such as I and you have often been employed by psychoanalysts as behavioral markers of the intrapsychic concepts of self and other and used to make inferences about the representation of these concepts in children as young as 18 months. Psycholinguistic research, however, reveals two sets of facts which such inferences overlook. First, knowledge of person pronouns, as of other words, is a developmental phenomenon. In children under 22-24 months, prior to the resolution of the rapprochement crisis, pronoun usage is stereotypic and wedded to context. Testing in diverse situations shows that this child has no consistent interpretation of these words. Second, and more important, when children acquire mature understanding of these words at the close of that rapproachement subphase, the knowledge reflected is somewhat different than psychoanalysts have held. Psycholinguistics shows that the meanings children express through person pronouns involve concepts of conversational role where first person indicates speaker, second person, person addressed, and third person, other (third) parties. It is argued that the psycholinguistic and psychoanalytic views on person-pronoun acquisition can be reconciled in the view that this developmental milestone is one of coordinating the expression of concepts of self and other with concepts of conversational roles. For psychoanalysts, then, person pronoun acquisition becomes a signal not only of the child's appreciation of the separateness of self and other, but also of their interrelatedness through the participation of self and other in conversational roles. The cognitive representation of these roles can be considered to function as an early ego identification, facilitating children's progress from the dyad to the larger social milieu.",

We human beings sleep nearly 6 to 8 hours during night time. This consolidated night time sleep pattern normally achieved at around 4 years of age and continues thereafter. It is seen that sleep has an important role in overall growth and cognitive development of the child. Any disturbances in quality or duration of sleep in childhood may predispose the child to many physical and mental disorders in later ages. Some of the childhood sleep disorders resolve spontaneously, some resolve with age and some may persist throughout the life as a genetic burden. On the other hand many of the mental disorders of childhood and adolescent affect the sleep pattern of the individual. Substance abuse in adolescents is a challenging situation where unhealthy sleep pattern considered having a great role. This review article is meant to focus how sleep disturbances in childhood can predispose to mental illness and in turn how various mental disorders affect the normal sleep pattern of a child.",

      "abstract": "Research has shown that child sexual abuse victims are overrepresented among sexual abuse offenders, leading to the sexually abused–sexual abuser hypothesis. However, a large proportion of child sexual abuse victims do not go on to sexually offend, and such individuals are labeled as resilient victims. Surprisingly few studies have looked at why some male victims of sexual abuse do not go on to offend. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 47 resilient men focusing on their beliefs as to why they had not gone on to sexually abuse others. Results revealed four themes for why the victims did not offend: empathy, morals, lack of sexual desire, or a combination of the previous three. In regard to the process of developing their resiliency, some participants claimed they made a conscious decision, whereas others reported the decision was an unconscious one. The various factors that were reported as contributing to the conscious or unconscious decision (becoming aware of sexual abuse, admitting the experience had happened to them, empathy, social support, and lack of sexual desire to abuse) are discussed, along with the four themes, and the implication of these results for prevention. Finally, conclusions are drawn that the victim–offender pathway is far from inevitable as most participants stated their reason for not offending was directly related to their own experience of sexual abuse victimisation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Accounts by 10 Caribbean men who have sex with men living in the UK reveal them to be liminal beings with unstable and unresolved identities. They are between social states: aware they are not heterosexual and not publicly recognised, or in some cases self‐accepted, as homosexual. Caribbean‐born respondents especially suffer from homophobia, expressing regret and disappointment at their sexuality. They may also experience cognitive dissonance – as they are aware of their conflict with the heteronormative order – they cannot resolve. Religion contributes to homophobia and cognitive dissonance particularly for Caribbean‐born men, some of whom may believe a fundamental conflict exists between Christianity and homosexuality. Heterosexism and homophobia contribute to and reinforce their liminal state, by preventing transition to publicly recognised homosexual status. Respondents may engage in private and public, internal and external, overt and covert policing of their and other gay men's behaviour: through strategic pretence at heterosexuality and/or condemnation of men engaging in behaviour identifiable as stereotypically homosexual, for example. Narratives point to the need to complexify the conventional understanding of Jamaican heterosexism to explain reported variations in the degree of anti‐homosexual hostility in the country. Résumé Les récits de 10 hommes originaires de la Caraïbe, ayant des rapports avec des hommes et vivant au Royaume Uni, révèlent que ces hommes sont des personnes liminales, avec des identités instables et non résolues. Ils évoluent d'un état à l'autre : conscients qu'ils ne sont pas hétérosexuels, et non reconnus publiquement ou, dans certains cas, ne s'acceptant pas en tant qu'homosexuels. Les répondants natifs de la Caraïbe sont ceux qui souffrent le plus de l'homophobie et expriment des regrets et de la déception par rapport à leur sexualité. Ils peuvent aussi expérimenter une dissonance cognitive – conscients qu'ils sont de leur situation conflictuelle par rapport à l'ordre hétéronormatif – qu'ils ne peuvent résoudre. La religion contribue à l'homophobie et à la dissonance cognitive, en particulier pour les hommes nés dans la Caraïbe, dont certains peuvent croire qu'il existe un conflit fondamental entre le christianisme et l'homosexualité. L'hétérosexisme et l'homophobie contribuent à leur état liminal et à renforcer celui‐ci, en empêchant leur transition vers un statut d'homosexuel reconnu publiquement. Les répondants peuvent se livrer à un contrôle, en privé et en public, interne et externe, manifeste et secret, de leurs comportements d'hommes gays et de celui d'autres hommes gays : par exemple, en employant la stratégie de prétendre qu'ils sont hétérosexuels et/ou de condamner les hommes dont les comportements sont des stéréotypes de comportements homosexuels. Les récits mettent l'accent sur la nécessité de complexifier l'explication conventionnelle de l'hétérosexisme jamaïcain, afin d'expliquer les variations des degrés d'hostilité envers les homosexuels dans ce pays. Resumen Los relatos de 10 hombres caribeños que tienen relaciones sexuales con otros hombres que viven en el Reino Unido revelan que son seres liminales con identidades inestables y sin resolver. Estos hombres se encuentran entre diferentes estados sociales: son conscientes de que no son heterosexuales, pero la sociedad no los reconoce como homosexuales o en algunos casos ellos mismos no se aceptan como tales. Los entrevistados nacidos en el Caribe sufren sobre todo homofobia, y muestran tener remordimientos y estar decepcionados por su sexualidad. Dado que son conscientes de su conflicto con el orden heteronormativo también pueden padecer disonancia cognitiva, que no pueden resolver. La religión contribuye a la homofobia y la disonancia cognitiva especialmente en hombres de origen caribeño, algunos de los cuales podrían creer que existe un conflicto fundamental entre el cristianismo y la homosexualidad. El heterosexismo y la homofobia contribuyen y refuerzan el estado liminal al impedir que pasen a ser reconocidos públicamente como homosexuales. A veces los entrevistados participan en un escrutinio privado y público, interno y externo, abierto y cubierto de su conducta, y la de otros, como hombres homosexuales: por ejemplo, fingiendo de forma estratégica ser heterosexuales y/o condenando a hombres que participan en conductas que se pueden identificar como estereotípicamente homosexuales. Los relatos apuntan que es necesario entender la complejidad que existe más allá del concepto convencional del heterosexismo jamaicano para explicar las variaciones de los relatos en lo que respecta a la hostilidad antihomosexual en el país.

      "title": "A Dynamic Systems Framework for Gender/Sex Development: From Sensory Input in Infancy to Subjective Certainty in Toddlerhood",
      "abstract": "From birth to 15 months infants and caregivers form a fundamentally intersubjective, dyadic unit within which the infant's ability to recognize gender/sex in the world develops. Between about 18 and 36 months the infant accumulates an increasingly clear and subjective sense of self as female or male. We know little about how the precursors to gender/sex identity form during the intersubjective period, nor how they transform into an independent sense of self by 3 years of age. In this Theory and Hypothesis article I offer a general framework for thinking about this problem. I propose that through repetition and patterning, the dyadic interactions in which infants and caregivers engage imbue the infant with an embodied, i.e., sensori-motor understanding of gender/sex. During this developmental period (which I label Phase 1) gender/sex is primarily an intersubjective project. From 15 to 18 months (which I label Phase 2) there are few reports of newly appearing gender/sex behavioral differences, and I hypothesize that this absence reflects a period of developmental instability during which there is a transition from gender/sex as primarily inter-subjective to gender/sex as primarily subjective. Beginning at 18 months (i.e., the start of Phase 3), a toddler's subjective sense of self as having a gender/sex emerges, and it solidifies by 3 years of age. I propose a dynamic systems perspective to track how infants first assimilate gender/sex information during the intersubjective period (birth to 15 months); then explore what changes might occur during a hypothesized phase transition (15 to 18 months), and finally, review the emergence and initial stabilization of individual subjectivity-the period from 18 to 36 months. The critical questions explored focus on how to model and translate data from very different experimental disciplines, especially neuroscience, physiology, developmental psychology and cognitive development. I close by proposing the formation of a research consortium on gender/sex development during the first 3 years after birth.",

Sexuality, the expression of interest, orientation, and preference, is a normal part of adolescence. Adolescent sexuality encompasses multiple factors, such as developing intimate partnerships, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and culture. Adolescent sexuality has changed over the past 50 years, with adolescents now reaching physical maturity earlier and marrying later. Puberty marks the obvious physical development in early to middle adolescence and is seen as the time for potential onset of sexual thoughts and experimentation. Mostly, legislation does not explicitly criminalize consensual sexual conduct between adolescents, and this leaves a gray area to be filled in by social and cultural norms that perceive adolescent sexual conduct negatively. Most state concentrate more on penalty than on initiatives to tackle the structural background of sexual inter course-related harms. Focusing on increasing access to youth friendly services that respect adolescents’ rights to health services and privacy will be important to ensure that adolescents seek and receive these services.",

At this time, a person more likely to adjust to many changes that happen in life such as declining physical ability, death of husband or wife, or friends age, retirement, and face the empty cage (empty nest), When the elderly unable to adjust to these circumstances, the elderly will feel lonely, a feeling of emptiness in social relations marked by a feeling alienated, rejected, abandoned, worthless, and felt alienated in a common life with others so that individuals feel their social relationships unsatisfactory that ultimately led to individuals experienced a\r\ndecrease both physical and psychological health. Loneliness experienced by the elderly if left unchecked will lead to a protracted prolonged stress, which in akhinya will fall into a condition called the tendency of depression, a condition that refers to the mood or feeling of profound melancholy and gloomy because of the conditions that affect aspects of one's life.

Hormones are produced in ductless glands and transported in the blood. Sex hormones are the specific hormones produced by the internal sex organs in both sexes. The pituitary gland then starts to produce sex-specific proportions of luteinizing hormones and follicle-stimulating hormones, which trigger increased growth of the ovaries in the female and the testes in the male. Pubertal status refers to the level of development reached by an individual in terms of physical changes at a given time. Pubertal status, measured in terms of bodily changes, has been found to correlate with negative moods and their intensity.",

Growing awareness of the adverse effects of many antidepressants on sexual function has led to attempts to resolve dysfunction though adjuvant or substitution treatment approaches.

      "abstract": "Significant social changes have resulted in increased exposure to sexual issues and greater tolerance of sexual behaviours such as premarital sex and homosexuality. These changes are not universal, however. We live in a multicultural society with widely varying sexual mores and frequent clashes of culture across generations. The media has contributed to unrealistic expectations about body image and sexual performance while at the same time increasing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases. Consequently, patients seek help with these issues and will discuss them freely if the general practitioner is comfortable in the area of sexual health.This article outlines an approach to sexual assessment and ways of addressing the barriers faced in taking a sexual history.All sexual disorders involve biological, psychological and social factors. General practice can provide a safe, non-judgmental environment for the patient to divulge sexual difficulties and have these dealt with holistically. However, this takes time, a significant obstacle in current practice.",

      "title": "Sexual Desire",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual desire is typically viewed as an interest in sexual objects or activities. Although sexual desire is often confused with sex drive, these are fundamentally different constructs. Whereas sex drive represents a basic, biologically mediated motivation to seek out sexual activity and/or sexual gratification (and hence is traitlike in nature), sexual desire is a specific state of sexual interest that typically has a specific target and/or trigger. Sexual desire can be elicited by a large variety of cues and situations, private thoughts, feelings, and fantasies, erotic materials (such as books, movies, photographs), and a variety of erotic environments, situations, or social interactions. Researchers have increasingly come to acknowledge that there are different forms of sexual desire. One useful distinction, first advanced in the context of research on nonhuman primates, is that between proceptivity and receptivity. Proceptivity refers to a basic urge to seek out and initiate sexual activity and is regulated by gonadal hormones (e.g., testosterone in men and estrogen in women). Receptivity, sometimes called arousability, represents the capacity to become sexually interested or aroused upon exposure to certain environmental or situational stimuli. Unlike proceptivity, arousability is not hormone‐dependent; in fact, even individuals with no circulating gonadal hormones show arousability to erotic stimuli, although they are not typically motivated to seek out sexual gratification.",

In this review the research findings concerning humour were collected. Twenty six relevant publications were found. The sense of humour does not seem to be greater in older than in younger adults. There are no indications that humour appreciation or production is associated with longevity. In older people there is a correlation between humour on the one hand and well-being and morale on the other. It has not been proven, however, that the use of humour by the elderly people has a favourable influence on their health. In health care for older people humour is sometimes used as a therapy. Scientific evidence of any positive effects of humour on mental health was not found. It is perhaps better for caretakers to show appreciation for the humour of older people than to make jokes about older people oneself.",

In the Oregon troop: i. Males' social interactions with the young go through two overlapping phases, one before and one after the birth of the year's new babies. Only the dominant males participate in the second phase which involves proximity with mothers and neonates. 2. Adult male Japanese macaque social behavior is strongly seasonal, and variations in male parental behavior are partly a ramification of a more general change in behavior. The view that the males' behavior is a response to distress produced in the young when the mother abandons them upon the birth of a newborn is not upheld by the Oregon data. 3. Male-young affiliative and play interactions are not likely to be an important contribution to the socialization of the young, since at all seasons the overwhelming majority of a young monkey's play and affiliative interactions are with his mother, siblings, and agemates. On the other hand, adult dominant males are responsible for virtually all of the attacks on a neonate under the age of 3 months. This may have an important effect on the social development of the young monkey.",

      "title": "Sexuality among elderly patients with dementia: Are we aware of their needs?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality is one of the basic needs in human life and its positive effects for the wellbeing are undeniable. People with dementia, despite cognition and functioning impairments, still pursue intimacy as part of their expression of basic human instincts. Objectives We aim to address the subject of sexuality among patients with dementia, emphasizing the physiological, environmental and legal barriers. Methods We conduct a non-systematic review of recent evidence on dementia and sexuality, using PubMed/Medline database. Results People with dementia face several difficulties expressing their sexuality. First, they struggle with physiological barriers to enjoyment of sexuality, such as ageism, apathy and limited free mobility. Secondly, either at home or in long-term care facilities, privacy is usually abolished. For care facilities, the Sexuality Assessment Tool supports the normalization of sexuality and self-audit policies that promote resident rights for privacy and assistance. Moreover, expression of sexuality in elderly can be misinterpreted as disinhibition, leading to unnecessary use of psychotropics to cease these behaviors. Additionally, legal barriers regarding consent arise when a partner loses the ability to consent sexual activity, questioning agreement and mutual desire. The Lichtenberg and Strzepek Decision Tree for Capacity to Participate in Intimate Relationships can be helpful to address this issue. Conclusions Sexuality in older people remains neglected in clinical intervention. Besides the urgent need to deconstruct stereotypes, families and staff must be sensitized to understand the changes in expression and perception of sexuality among people with dementia, rather than being indifferent or medicate what can be perceived as disinhibited/distorted expressions of normal needs. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "To a healthy child who has been well trained, nothing appears more easy than to be happy; to a child who has been badly trained, whose infant years have been neglected or motherless, nothing appears more difficult. There is often something in the bodily constitution, too, which stands in the way of individual happiness, without our being sensible of any actual disease; and the mother ought to watch carefully every symptom of this nature as indications of growing evil, which may frustrate much of the good she naturally looks forward to in the future experience of her child. She ought especially to observe, if, when the family group are loudest in their mirth, there is one who falls back from the cheerful circle, and who, instead of catching the natural infection of laughter and glee, sits moping alone, with cloudy brow, and drooping head, as if incapable of partaking in the general feeling. Such a tendency as this, is generally to be attributed to some bodily indisposition, of which perhaps the child is not aware; but it may also arise from a peculiarity of temperament, only to be accounted for upon the principle that there are diseases of mind, as well as body, the seeds of which are inherent in our nature.",

Six months after spousal loss, only those men with low or average levels of social support from friends are more likely than women to report interest in remarrying someday. Similar patterns emerge for interest in dating 18 months after loss. Persons who both want and have a romantic relationship report significantly fewer depressive symptoms 18 months after loss, yet this relationship is attributable to their greater socioeconomic resources.",

      "abstract": "Despite general perceptions of committed romantic relationships as the most satisfying context with which to engage in sexual activity, acceptance of casual sexual contexts has increased in recent years. Yet little research has examined sexual and emotional satisfaction outside of the committed relationship context. Further, most satisfaction research has focused exclusively on heterosexual samples. The present study aimed to investigate sexual and emotional satisfaction derived from seven sexual relationship contexts and note similarities or differences based on gender and sexual orientation. Data were drawn from an online survey of 6,955 sexually diverse participants. Sexual satisfaction was stronger than emotional satisfaction within casual sex contexts (one night stand, first date, sex with a friend, and hookups) than within more committed contexts (married, living together, committed unmarried relationship). Men found all contexts except for sex in a committed unmarried relationship significantly more sexually and emotionally satisfying than women. Emotional and sexual satisfaction were significantly different across sexual orientation groups in casual sexual relationship contexts but not in more committed relationship contexts. Gay men reported gaining the most sexual and emotional satisfaction out of casual sex contexts, with lesbian women reporting the least out of casual sexual contexts. Overall, this research found that a wide variety of relationship contexts, including casual sexual contexts, can be a source of both sexual and emotional satisfaction.",

      "title": "Overview of infertility",
      "abstract": "Having a child is an innate trait in animals, including humans, and is required for the continued existence of all animal species. Therefore, for most women, the inability to conceive or to do so in a timely fashion - termed infertility - to enable the continuation of the family line can be emotionally distressing. The definition of infertility is controversial because of its separation into primary and secondary. This is further complicated by the loosely used term subfertility, which relates to couples who have reduced ability because they take longer than the natural time to conceive, as opposed to those who are infertile and are entirely unable to conceive after 6 to 12 months, depending on age. Infertility evaluation requires a thorough male and female history, physical examination of both partners, and targeted investigation to determine the cause of infertility in a particular couple. Various treatments apply to infertile couples depending on the age of the female partner, the results of investigations, the reason for infertility, the presence of inheritance of abnormal genes, the pregnancy rates the couple is happy with, the resources available, how desperate the couple is to achieve a live birth, and how much they want to commit to treatment. Infertility treatment could include counseling and expectant management only, intrauterine insemination in a natural or stimulated cycle, and IVF and or ICSI. Men with azoospermia will need surgical options to retrieve sperm for IVF/ ICSI, but rarely for IUI. This review overviews infertility's etiology, diagnosis, investigations, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Long-term relationship is associated with decreasing sexual desire, frequency and satisfaction in both men and women. As well, relationship length is associated with increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The increase in sexual motivation resulting from the addition of a novel sexual partner has been the focus of a large number of animal studies including male rodents, chimpanzees and fruit flies. Experimental studies in humans showed consistently habituation of sexual arousal to erotic material. Repetitive display of a single erotic slide resulted in less subjective and physiological sexual arousal than exposure to different and novel slides. The presence of novel sexual partners in sexual fantasies, and the frequency with which extra-marital relationships occur, is also consistent with the importance of novelty in sexual desire. On the other hand, most men and women by the age of 40 will be married, in order to achieve safety, permanence, a better care for offspring and pooling resources. Such a social monogamy is generally accompanied by the expectation of sexual monogamy. Is it possible to combine a happy long-term marriage that keeps sexuality alive? The role of the dopaminergic reward system, attention, psychiatric disorders and socio-cultural factors will be discussed.",

      "title": "Stuttering: Genetic updates and a case report",
      "abstract": "Developmental stuttering is a common disorder of speech dissiliency that is characterized by excessive repetitions of sounds, syllables, and monosyllabic words, as well as sound prolongations and complete blockages of the vocal tract. About 60 million people are affected and it is more common between the age of 3 and 6, when children begin forming sentences and connecting thoughts verbally. There are three types of stuttering known as developmental stuttering, neurogenic stuttering, and psychogenic stuttering. The exact pathophysiology of developmental stuttering is unknown; however, various family and twin studies have repeatedly implicated heredity as a major factor in the etiology of stuttering. It is clear that the genetic influence is not in the form of an exact single gene effect such as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or x-linked in all families; however, in all of the inheritance forms it is influenced by sex with higher occurrence in males than females at a ratio of 4:1 in older children and adults. Recently special genetic locus has been determined on several autosomal chromosomes related to developmental stuttering. In this report, the proband is a 20-year-old boy was referred to our clinic for premarriage genetic counseling; he has been affected since 3 years and now is under cure. three generation study of his family show 13 individuals are affected by stuttering. For the first it occurred in the proband's grandfather and after this time about all of affected cases has been seen in consanguineous marriages. Therefore, the genetical inheritance of stuttering is crystal clear in this family and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is proposed. Totally in such families with repeated occur of stuttering, we cannot account it as a multifactorial disorder.",

      "title": "Brain Effects of Environmental Enrichment and Deprivation",
      "abstract": "The role of experience in brain organization and function can be studied by systematically manipulating developmental experiences. The most common protocols use extremes in experiential manipulation, such as environmental deprivation and/or enrichment. Studies of the effects of deprivation range from laboratory studies in which animals are raised in the absence of sensory or social experiences from infancy to children raised in orphanages with limited caregiver interaction. In both cases there are chronic perceptual, cognitive, and social dsyfunctions that are associated with chronic changes in neuronal structure and connectivity. Deprivation can be more subtle too, such as being raised in a low socioeconomic environment, which is often associated with poverty. Such experience is especially detrimental to language development, which in turn, limits educational opportunities. Unfortunately, the effects of some forms of socioemotional deprivation are often difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate. In contrast, adding sensory or social experiences can enhance behavioral functions. For example, placing animals in environments that are cognitively, motorically, and/or socially more complex than standard laboratory housing is associated with neuronal changes that are correlated with superior functions. Enhanced sensory experiences can be relatively subtle, however. For example, tactile stimulation with a soft brush for 15 minutes, three times daily for just two weeks in infant rats leads to permanent improvement in a wide range of psychological functions, including motoric, mnemonic, and other cognitive functions. Both complex environments and sensory stimulation can also reverse the negative effects of many other experiences. Thus, tactile stimulation accelerates discharge from hospital for premature human infants and stimulates recovery from stroke in both infant and adult rats. In sum, brain and behavioral functions are exquisitely influenced by manipulation of sensory experiences, especially in development.",

      "abstract": "Having multiple identities as a homosexual American Indian or Alaska Native adolescent male increases the likelihood for poorer health and diminished well-being. This study assessed the differences in self-perceived health status between gay adolescent males and their heterosexual counterparts. A national nonrepresentative sample of 5,602 Indian and Native adolescent males was surveyed about issues of sexual behavior, physical and sexual abuse, mental health status, substance use, attitudes about school, participation in violence, and access to health care. Results indicate that there were no real differences between gay and heterosexual male respondents for substance use or attitudes about school. Statistically significant differences were found, however, in areas of mental health, as well as physical and sexual abuse. Gay adolescents were twice as likely to have thought of or attempted suicide. Gay adolescents were twice as likely to have been physically abused and nearly six times more likely to have been sexually abused. Gay American Indian or Alaska Native adolescent males constitute a very vulnerable population and are clearly in need of targeted health and social services. Unfortunately, the benefits seen by adults of the \"two-spirited\" gay and lesbian American Indian movement have not been accessible to Indian and Native adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Adults tend to attribute agency and intention to the causes of negative outcomes, even if those causes are obviously mechanical. Is this over-attribution of negative agency the result of years of practice with attributing agency to actual conspecifics, or is it a foundational aspect of our agency-detection system, present in the first year of life? Here we present two experiments with 6-month-old infants, in which they attribute agency to a mechanical claw that causes a bad outcome, but not to a claw that causes a good outcome. Control experiments suggest that the attribution stems directly from the negativity of the outcome, rather than from physical cues present in the stimuli. Together, these results provide evidence for striking developmental continuity in the attribution of agency to the causes of negative outcomes.",

Early marriage presents the facets of drive level differences, of sexual ignorance, fatigue states, and paired‐relation images. The sexual complaint is rarely presented as such. Middle marriage is laden with a host of troubles which will present some sexual face. Personal incompatibilities are well developed, progressive alienation is occuring, preoccupation with career or child raising is prominent, and frank psychiatric states come into full bloom. Sexual complaints are readily voiced at this stage. Advanced marriage is marked by the aggravated incompatibilities, the increasing occurence of disease states and both the conditioned libido loss and that induced by medications. The specific problems, and their possible solutions are more readily identified and dealt with within this kind of framework.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human societies are organised around cooperative interactions, the origins and development of which have become a timely topic. In this study, we investigated the development of indirect reciprocity in 18–24-month-old toddlers, and infants aged 6 months, on a two-phase sharing task with non-familiar individuals. In the first phase, we observed whether infants and toddlers differentiated and manifested a preference toward an individual altruistically sharing or acting selfishly. In the second phase, infants and toddlers interacted with the same prosocial and antisocial individuals seen in the first phase, and we observed whether they were willing to share with one of the two. Indirect reciprocity was assessed as the match between the preferences for the prosocial individual in phase one, and the first-person sharing in the second phase. Evidence showed that toddlers, but not infants, indirectly reciprocated the prosocial individual, suggesting that understanding of such a complex behaviour as indirect reciprocity may require prolonged experience in order to emerge.",

      "abstract": "Primates and dolphins exhibit comparable examples of all categories of non-conceptive sexual behaviors, including sexual interactions involving immature individuals, those involving individuals of the same sex, and copulation during the non-conceptive period. Although mammals of other taxa also perform non-conceptive sexual behaviors, the fact that there are so many reports of non-conceptive sexual interactions among higher primates and dolphins suggest a link between the nonreproductive use of sexual behaviors and high intelligence. This link might be because the greater role of learning in sexual behavior expands the possibility for sex to be incorporated into a variety of non-conceptive functions. Non-conceptive sexual behaviors seem to reflect or be influenced by important social factors, including affiliative relations and alliance between individuals of the same or different sex, high social status of females, within-group or between-group tension resolution, mate selection, and infanticide prevention. Animals may employ non-conceptive sexual behaviors to control various important aspects of their relationships with others which they cannot control with other social behaviors, which suggests that instances of non-conceptive sexual behaviors may serve as keys to understanding important aspects of the social relationships or social structure of the species.",

We want to redress this deficiency and a surprising number of chapters in the book concern themselves with disorders and diseases that occur in adult males. It is a time of many life events like marriage, fatherhood, divorce, and work-related problems. Men’s emotions in this phase of life have come under scrutiny by both sexes and the consensus seems to be that adult males are quite afraid of their emotions. This has implications for the manner in which men deal with health symptoms and life crises. The language used to express depressive feelings has an emotional content that may well be rejected or denied by men, and this in turn has important implications for history-taking. The vulnerability of the adult single male to depression and suicide is highlighted in this chapter. Is there such a thing as the male menopause? The author is emphatic that there is not, making his arguments worth sceptical scrutiny.",

This increased awareness of parents is based on many factors: the child's appearance in the more formal clothing demanded by his increasing social life; his greatly increased size, with the corresponding increase in any deformity which he may have; his lack of skill in managing his suddenly enlarged body and its members, and, most of all, their startled realization that the child can no longer be counted on to outgrow his undesirable physical traits and that these, in fact,",

Recent studies have also indicated the absence of homosexual stereotypes; homosexual men and women are quite diverse in the way they organize their lives sexually as well as socially. The implication of this finding for physicians is that a complete history, including sexual history, is necessary in any patient regardless of sexual orientation to determine factors that may be placing the patient at an increased risk for disease. Additionally, the primary care physician may be called upon by the homosexual patient to provide psychosexual counselling or treatment of sexual dysfunctions. Certain verbal and nonverbal signals may facilitate or inhibit the relationship between the physician and the homosexual patient. Homosexual patients may need special reassurance about confidentiality in the doctor-patient relationship and about the physician's respect for their life-styles and significant relationships.",

Hierarchical negative binomial regression analysis is used.Between 1 in 4 and 5 older adults who are married exhibit moderate or strong emotional or social loneliness. Stronger emotional and social loneliness is observed in adults whose spouse has health problems, who do not often receive emotional support from the spouse, who have nonfrequent conversations or are in disagreement, or who evaluate their current sex life as not (very) pleasant or not applicable. Emotional loneliness is stronger among women in second marriages, whereas marked social loneliness is especially characteristic of older men with disabled spouses. Moreover, smaller social networks and less contact with children also increase emotional and social loneliness in later life.Differentiating marital quality and gender provides greater insight into emotional and social loneliness in married older people.",

      "title": "The Mystery of Mammalian Puberty: How Much More Do We Know?",
      "abstract": "THE MYSTERY OF MAMMALIAN PUBERTY: HOW MUCH MORE DO WE KNOW? SERGIO R. OJEDA* Introduction The advent of sexual maturation is one of the most remarkable events in the life span of an individual. In both humans and lower species the attainment of puberty signals sexual availability, but in even the most primitive cultures puberty also represents the end of absolute parental dependence and the initiation of greater (and not necessarily welcomed) social responsibilities. The ancients were fascinated, as we are, by the somatic changes associated with sexual development but were not particularly attentive to the psychological manifestations of the process. Nowadays this is recognized as important, but in contrast to the somatic changes, little if anything is known about the influence that hormones may have in shaping and/or initiating pubertal psychological and behavioral shifts. Strong morphological , biochemical, and molecular evidence now exists, indicating that steroid hormones of gonadal and adrenal origin are recognized by specific receptor molecules in discrete brain areas, thereby affecting neuronal function in various manners. Thus, it would not be unreasonable to suspect that the underlying biological component of pubertal changes in mood, cognitive behavior, and social adaptation involves the action of steroid hormones on relevant neuronal populations. While detection of psychological changes during human puberty may require considerable experience, the somatic changes are so conspicuous that they cannot pass unnoticed by even the most casual observer. There is little doubt that a major part of these changes is determined by the integrated activation of different components of the neuroendocrine system. For instance, breast development in girls requires the concerted action of many hormones, including gonadal steroids, prolactin, and *Division of Neuroscience, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, 505 N.

The neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in the onset of mammalian puberty are exceedingly complex and not readily accessible to detailed scrutiny. It is thus not surprising that progress toward their elucidation has been slow and painstakingly acquired. This article does not intend to review the existing literature in the field; rather, it will attempt to provide a perspective of how our thinking has evolved over the years, where we are now, and what may be some new avenues of research that may lead us to solve the mystery of puberty. Necessarily succinct—and to provide a more focused perspective on the problem, the article will draw mainly from evidence gathered in rats and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Those readers interested in more details are referred to recent in-depth review articles [1-3]. No attempt will be made to discuss the intriguing but still poorly understood area of psychoneuroendocrinology of puberty. Finally, in discussing the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty, we shall make the assumption that the anatomical and functional core of this process is the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Basic interactions within the axis include production of the neuropeptide luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) by a group of specialized hypothalamic neurons, the transportation of LHRH via the portal vasculature to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates gonadotropin secretion, the stimulatory effect of gonadotropins on gonadal function, and the regulatory effects of gonadal hormones on hypothalamic -pituitary function. The Early Days An early implication that sexual maturation was controlled by the central nervous system came with the clinical observation that delayed puberty in patients with Frohlich's syndrome was associated with ventral brain damage [4]. It was not until 1932, however, that Hohlweg and Junkmann [5] advanced the concept of a neural \"sex center\" involved in controlling puberty and reproductive cyclicity. Unexpectedly, this concept did not gain acceptance until 20 years later, when Harris and Jacobsohn conclusively demonstrated the pivotal role of the hypothalamus in controlling anterior pituitary function [6]. These findings initiated an era in which experimental situations were imposed to manipulate the neuroendocrine axis and attempts were made to measure hormonal changes. Surprisingly, many basic conclusions and core assumptions that have governed our understanding of...",

Adequate coexistence of hunger and satiety brings health and wellbeing and inadequacy in food intake can threaten the health and survival. Eating behavior is a complex phenomenon compounded by interplay of central nervous system, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems linked with numerous neural pathways [1]. To put anything in mouth is a discernible human behavior and governed by hunger, hormones, emotions, and desires. Numerous life events may claw the normal eating behavior leading to aberrant eating pattern, if prolonged can result in Eating Disorders (ED). Anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating are common eating disorders which affects millions of people of all ages, men, women particularly teenage girls. Major causes of ED were associated with physical and emotional destructions due to psychological and socio-cultural factors. New researches are indicating its link with genetic and neurochemical pursuits. In most cases of anorexia, the victims have high self-image and want to protect oneself from body shaming. ED victims are often entrapped in fancy images of their bodies in social and media circles and are either unaware or refuse to accept their problem and its adverse consequences. ED is a manifestation of anxiety and trauma of self-image stirring to the extent of hospitalization and fatal stage.",

The reasons are many: bad state of health, complaints, decrease of fitness, genital atrophy, gynecological operations, partner problems, and others. On the other side, sexuality can be maintained up to high age. In any case is the demand for affection, tenderness, love and sexual relations nearly always present, and its realization should not be inhibited. The sexual reactions are decreased and retarded. Therefore often a change of the role and behaviour pattern of the partners is necessary in the sexual contact. The partners should know their mutual problems and desires, show understanding and should adjust to each other. Counselling, behaviour therapy and treatment with sexual hormones can help to solve the problems.",

La destructividad se refiere a la naturaleza destructiva de un elemento vivo o no vivo y, mas generalmente, a la capacidad de destruir. En relacion con este concepto, podemos observar, en general, los llamados factores de gravedad y otros llamados factores de proteccion que pueden coexistir. Si los primeros son mas graves, hay una alta probabilidad de que los sintomas sean incapacitantes y duraderos, observando que pueden empeorar con el tiempo o aparecer de forma retardada. Si los factores de proteccion son significativos, entonces es mas probable que el nino experimente un trauma leve y una curacion mas o menos rapida.",

      "title": "Introduction Into the Diagnostics and Treatment of Premature Ejaculation: Sexuality Has Many Facets",
      "abstract": "This interesting article leaves many questions unanswered. Even though meaningful long-term studies are lacking, the authors neither discussed the course of premature ejaculation between individuals and in the same individual nor whether symptoms are due to a particular sexual partner or to the man’s form of the day. Etiologically, distress or particular personality traits were left out of the discussion, as were aspects of whether premature ejaculation is the cause or effect of a partner interaction that may be problematic only at second glance, whether the symptoms occur regularly, or whether the same man also has these problems while masturbating. And what about the influence of circumcision? It seems that the regions with a reportedly high prevalence of premature ejaculation – such as South America and Asia – represent typical macho cultures, rather than focusing on the female orgasm in particular, as the authors claim.\r\n\r\nIf the high prevalence of 30% worldwide (1) is true then this could be due to a physiological variant to the norm. To suggest that this has the status of an illness – presumably in order to have reasons for (psycho)therapeutic or pharmacological interventions, financed by the health insurance companies – is something that should be subject to critical questioning (2). authors do not mention that human sexuality may have many more facets and be much more subtle (3) than the actual act of intercourse would reflect. From this perspective, in many men, the subjective experience of illness – which may well be zeitgeist-oriented and depend on their individual disposition – might even be increased. However, a man’s procreative ability does not seem to be appreciably affected by premature ejaculation. Further, at a time of high global promiscuity, premature ejaculation may be an advantage in terms of procreative strategy, pointedly formulated as in the tried and tested principle: The early bird catches the worm.",

These children show extreme and enduring forms of gender nonconforming/gender variant behaviours, preferences, and interests because they do not identify with their birthassigned gender. Because of the incongruence between their assigned gender and experienced gender, these children may experience clinically significant distress and are consequently often in need of clinical attention (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).",

Non-masculinity was strongly associated with male homosexuality. Homophobic verbal and physical abuse was portrayed alongside negative appraisals of non-masculinity. This may be indicative of internalised anti-effeminacy values.\r\nMarginalisation in gay communities was also portrayed, including romantic rejection. Intersections of gender-expression and ethnicity or age were important in evaluations of sexual attractiveness. Conversely, masculinity was often eroticised or regarded as aspirational. Positive qualities associated with non-masculinity included expressiveness, humour and flexibility in working with power demonstrations of others. These reinforce the assertion that effeminate and androgynous men bypass facets of gender-role conflict.",

While males are solely responsible for around 20% to 30% of infertility cases, overall, they contribute to half of the cases.[2] It is well known that infertility may induce stress on couples who fail to conceive, but it is unclear whether psychological stress causes infertility.[3] Determining the emotional and psychological impact of male infertility and knowing whether it can improve outcomes if addressed is one of the priorities of male infertility research.[4] Infertile men generally suffer silently, and consequently report lower levels of psychological distress in questionnaires;[5] considering that the concepts of male fertility and virility are part of the perception of masculinity, it is not illogical to assume that there is a social concern that could influence male sexual and reproductive health.[6] A study[7] has found that the pessimism and psychological distress reported by male partners in couples undergoing in vitro fertilization had a negative linear correlation with clinical pregnancy. This might be due to the fact that psychological stress reduces sperm count, progressive motility, and increases abnormal morphology.[8] Another study[9] found an inverse relationship between erectile dysfunction and quality of life measured through the fertility quality of life tool (FertiQoL) and a significant relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction.

      "abstract": "Recently in Ukraine there has been a tendency to the spread of crime against minors, which can be explained by a decrease in the standard of living of the country’s citizens, which leads to the marginalization and degradation of the population. Today, the most resonant crimes are crimes that infringe on sexual freedom and sexual integrity of the person. Criminal statistics show that in Ukraine there is a deterioration in the crime situation and an increase in the number of crimes against children on sexual grounds.The article examines crimes against sexual freedom and sexual inviolability committed against children, the social danger of which is obvious. The author notes that most sexual crimes are committed by persons from the child’s immediate environment: family members – father, stepfather, grandfather, uncle, or well-known persons (for example, friends of the parents). Therefore, such crimes leave deep mental trauma for the affected persons, causing negative changes in social behavior, often causing sexual deviations. It has been established that crimes against sexual freedom and sexual inviolability of the child have a high level of latency, which is explained, firstly, by the age of the victims, who do not always understand that a crime has been committed against them. And secondly, intimidation and threats from the rapist force children to keep silent about the facts of sexual violence.The article notes that such crimes are distinguished by the specificity of recurrent manifestations, as well as certain criminological signs and characteristic features of the personality of a criminal who carries out sexual violence against minors.The trend towards an increase in the number of these crimes is of interest to practitioners who need the results of a criminological analysis of the personality of a criminal in order to develop a set of measures to prevent such crimes. Therefore, there is a need for further criminological research of sexual crimes against children.",

      "abstract": "Viewed from a developmental perspective, adolescent male sexuality is the time of transition from childhood experimentation to satisfactory adult sexuality. This transition is often difficult because of misinforma tion or lack of empirically accurate information about sexuality, cultural expectations of masculinity defined by gender roles, and differential parental and peer socialization of males from infancy through adoles cence. The quest for adult masculinity and sexuality for adolescent males is further complicated by a social context that exaggerates fears of femin ity and homophobia and that overlooks their sexual behavior in the areas of adolescent fatherhood and adolescent sexual offenders.",

The historical lack of mainstream sports opportunities for people with disabilities is one of the important rationales for the development of disability sport.

Although their overall sports participation rates remain relatively low, people with disabilities have become increasingly involved in the pursuit of sport at various levels over the past few decades.",

      "abstract": "Many findings demonstrate a negative image toward old people in our society. \"Being-old\" is characterised by many negative stereotypes. The elderly are often seen as victims or targets of discrimination against the aged (\"ageism\"). We also find self-discrimination in the elderly's image of \"being-old\"; this could be a result of assimilating the general image of \"being-old\" in our society to the self-concept of the elderly. We asked 30 persons, 63-96 years old, to give a description of \"being-old\". Our participants differed in sex, health status, and social housing conditions (number of persons living together). The given aspects of \"being-old\" had to be semantically described and evaluated. We got 279 aspects of \"being-old\" which we put into 13 categories. We did not find a generally negative image of \"being-old\". All participants did not assess themselves as being \"old\", regardless of their age. The most frequently cited aspects of \"being-old\" were \"physical and mental activity\", \"achievement-relation\" and \"autonomy\", but not \"disease\" or \"decrease of power\". As far as they are concerned, aspects of \"having time and calmness\" were more often mentioned than aspects of \"being-religious\" or thinking about \"dying and death\". Participants living with their partners or family members more often talked about themselves than singles did when they explained a given aspect of \"being-old\" to the interviewer. Those who live without health problems more often talked about diseases than ill participants did. Women more frequently explained self evaluation of health problems to the interviewer than men.",

Until recently, this question has been approached mainly in terms of the presence of psychiatric illness, deviant sexual interests and/or impaired psychosocial development. Empirical research has as yet generally failed to demonstrate this approach to be adequate. It is estimated that only about 40% of juvenile sex offenders appear to show some kind of psychological or developmental deviance. The theoretical framework that is presented here approaches sexual abuse committed by juveniles in terms of normal developmental processes, next to deviant processes. It describes this behaviour, and its presence or absence, as a result of the interaction of biological, psychological and situational factors.",

In the present article, the literature on sibling child sexual abuse is critically reviewed, and particular attention is focused on defining sibling sexual abuse, and determining its scope and effects.

Many institutions actively prohibit sexual expression and in other situations passively set the conditions for sexual assault and exploitation. These experiences in many cases have long-lasting and deleterious effects even after people return to the community. Recognizing that all people whatever their circumstances are sexual beings there is a need for explicit institutional policies that provide an atmosphere where sexual expression can be normalized as much as possible while ensuring a safe and supportive environment.

With scientific ideology proscribing talk of subjective states in animals, common-sense acknowledgment of pain and other noxious states in animals was ruled out by fiat and was thus invisible, even to veterinary scientists.

This diagnosis is intended to include only individuals who experience dissatisfaction with their low levels of sexual desire. Women with this condition will often report that they \"want to want\" more sex, while women with low levels of sexual desire that do not meet HSDD criteria will indicate no bother or concerns with the frequency of their sexual desire. The subjective experience of distress caused by low desire is a critical component of the diagnosis of HSDD because many individuals are not alarmed by low levels of sexual desire. Indeed, an epidemiological study conducted in Australia demonstrated that 32% of women who are 20–70 years old report low sexual desire, but only 16% report distress caused by the low sexual desire [2].",

Sexually abused children feel betrayed and respond to being used as a sexual object. They feel spoilt, debased and violated. Bewildering feelings of guilt are mixed with anger and shame.

      "title": "Spontaneous pregnancy and unexplained infertility: A gift with many whys",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nInfertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. The dualism between the so-called “Psychogenic hypothesis” and the hypothesis of “Psychological consequences of infertility” has been solved with the proposal of an interactive and bidirectional relationship between infertility and psychosocial diseases.[1] Infertility itself can cause severe stress on both partners and start a vicious cycle resulting in the decreasing likelihood of pregnancy and even of treatment success. The infertility treatment could be responsible for a major impairment of the sex life because it frequently digs into the intimacy of the couple. Moreover the “emotional rollercoaster” related to the treatment is felt, especially by the women, to be extremely mentally stressful. Sexual intercourse can lose its spontaneity because it is aimed at “baby-making” and it is strictly restricted to “fertile” days. Sexuality can be therefore deprived of its recreative and erotic value and subordinated to the direct goal of pregnancy. Furthermore, sexual intercourse may be increasingly associated with a sense of failure, affecting even the patient's image of his/her own body. According to a recent meta-analysis, sexual disorders – depending on both infertility itself and infertility diagnosis and treatment – are common in infertile couples, with women more affected than men.[2]\r\n\r\nLittle is known about spontaneous pregnancy after infertility therapy either successful or failed. Couples dealing with long-term involuntary childlessness usually consider in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as a final option but a relative high incidence of treatment-independent pregnancies especially in couples with unexplained infertility is frequently reported. Hennely et al., analyzed the spontaneous conception rate after a successful IVF cycle. In this retrospective study 106 of 513 (20.7%) couples obtained a spontaneous pregnancy two years after Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) birth success.[3] The likelihood of spontaneous conception was higher in younger women and was strongly connected to the duration of infertility. Indeed, women who have been infertile for a shorter period more likely achieved a spontaneous pregnancy. In a recent study,[4] 2134 couples were retrospectively analyzed in order to estimate the frequency of spontaneous pregnancies among couples previously treated by IVF. The spontaneous pregnancy rate was 17% among couples who previously achieved pregnancy through ART and 24% among couples who conceived spontaneously after unsuccessful medical treatment. Among both groups, almost 60% of the spontaneous pregnancies occurred two to three years after the last IVF transfer. The proportion of spontaneous pregnancies was higher in couples with unexplained infertility, suggesting a better fertility prognosis compared with couples whose infertility is of known origin. Spontaneous conception in couples with unexplained infertility could be related either to the stress relief after the decision to abandon the therapy or to the placebo effect after being placed in the waiting list before starting the treatment. Treatment-independent pregnancies occur sometimes after a successful ART procedure or after adoption, suggesting the important impact of psychological factors on fertility.\r\n\r\nNevertheless spontaneous pregnancy in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility remains nowadays a mysterious event. Many questions are still unanswered. Is spontaneous conception connected to a previous ovarian stimulation, necessary in some IVF cycles? Could the previous pregnancy be responsible for endocrine changes that increase the reproductive potential? Or is it mainly related to the stress relief that undoubtedly occurs after achieving parenthood? A lot of work in that direction needs to be done. It remains however important to remind to every couple starting an infertility treatment that spontaneous conception before, during or after ART-procedures has to be taken into account!",

      "title": "Tall Stature",
      "abstract": "Tall stature is rarely pathologic, but the pediatric health care clinician must be able to distinguish familial causes from those due to endocrine or genetic reasons. Defined as a height 2 SDs above the mean for age and sex or greater than the 95th percentile, tall stature is usually familial or secondary to obesity. Although there is known psychological stigma associated with short stature, the paucity of evidence that tall stature in females or males is psychologically detrimental makes the previous practice of sex hormone administration to decrease ultimate adult height no longer acceptable.When evaluating tall stature, it is first necessary to plot serial height measurements during multiple visits. If these measurements confirm the criteria for tall stature, the clinician should calculate the child's projected adult height by calculating the midparental height as follows:Parental heights should be measured directly because self-reported heights are often overestimated, especially in men. If a child has at least one tall parent and plots within 5 cm of the target adult height range, he/she is considered to have familial, or constitutional, tall stature. In this circumstance, no further investigation is warranted as long as the child is developing normally and has normal physical examination findings. Measurement of body proportions is also important, including upper body to lower body ratios and arm span, because these measures can help differentiate between pathologic and familial tall stature. At birth, the upper extremity to lower extremity ratio should be 1.7. By early childhood, this proportion should be 0.89 to 0.95. In addition, a child's arm span is generally 1 cm shorter than his height, whereas an adolescent's arm span is generally equal to his height. Klinefelter syndrome should be considered in a patient with tall stature, increased arm span, sparse hair, small testes, and a high-pitched voice, predicating the need for karyotype testing. A tall patient with decreased upper to lower body segment ratio, hyperextensible joints, and scoliosis may have Marfan syndrome.If pathologic tall stature is suspected, a bone age radiograph of left hand, fingers, and wrist should be ordered. A normal bone age is consistent with familial tall stature, whereas accelerated bone age in a nonobese child must lead the pediatrician to consider precocious puberty or growth hormone excess. Obesity leads to tall stature in childhood with a normal final adult height and is associated with accelerated skeletal maturation. Although the exact mechanism for obesity's role in tall stature is not understood, the hormone ghrelin, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, insulin-like growth factors, and insulin all have the potential to mediate linear growth.In conjunction with bone age, precocious puberty can be diagnosed with Tanner staging and assessing testicular volume in males, with a postpubertal testicular volume being greater than 4 mL. Patients with late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia present with precocious puberty, tall stature, and an increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone level in the blood. Growth hormone excess is rare in children, yet when present is usually due to pituitary adenomas. Growth hormone excess before epiphyseal fusion results in tall stature and markedly increased height velocity. If it occurs after epiphyseal fusion, adolescents may also have signs of acromegaly, such as coarsening of facial features, enlarged jaw, and distal body overgrowth, including large hands and feet.There are other rare genetic syndromes associated with tall stature, all of which have significant clinical stigmata that should be apparent on physical examination. Sotos syndrome should be considered if the bone age is accelerated and the child has accompanying symptoms of facial flushing, frontal bossing, and a narrow face and head. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is considered if hypoglycemia is present at birth, along with anterior abdominal wall defects and macroglossia. Marshall-Smith syndrome is associated with unusually rapid physical growth, abnormal facies, and respiratory issues.A pediatric health care professional can diagnose most causes of tall stature with a careful history and physical examination. If suspicion is high for disease or the cause is unclear, the clinician should consider radiographic bone age and focused laboratory testing. Although the social stigma behind tall stature has decreased, clinicians must still be aware of potential pathologic causes of tall stature that would warrant intervention.Comments: This In Brief emphasizes the importance of accurate height measurements. My experience is that height measurement can often be inaccurate, especially in supine measurements in young children or very active children who have difficulty standing still. When transitioning from supine measurements to standing measurements in toddlers, there may appear to be a false perception of a decrease in height because standing height is often shorter than supine length. Accurate measurement of upper to lower body segment ratios is important in identifying several syndromes and can be performed in the following way. To measure lower body segment, measure from the symphysis pubis of the patient to the floor. The upper segment can be calculated by subtracting the lower segment from the total height. Measurement of arm span is best accomplished by measuring from the tip of the middle finger of one hand, with arms outstretched at a 90° angle to the tip of the middle finger of the other hand.A recent study of self-reported adult height measurements in parents found that men have a tendency to overestimate their heights but women's self-report is more accurate. When looking at estimating the other parent's height, women were more likely to overestimate the men's height, whereas men were more accurate in estimating women's height.

      "abstract": "Adolescents experience maltreatment at rates equal to or exceeding those of younger children. Recent increases in reported cases of maltreatment have occurred disproportionately among older children and adolescents. However, adolescents are less likely to be reported to child protective services and are more likely to be perceived as responsible for their maltreatment. Adolescent girls are reported as victims more often than boys, especially in sexual abuse. However, boys may be less likely to be identified or reported and often are abused by nonfamily members. Parents of adolescent victims have higher average income and educational levels and are less likely to have a parental history of abuse than parents of younger children. A wide range of serious adolescent risk behaviors is associated with maltreatment. These include increased risk of premature sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, emotional disorders, suicide attempts, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug abuse, and delinquent behavior. Incarcerated youth, homeless or runaway youth, and youth who victimize siblings or assault parents have been shown to have high rates of prior maltreatment. Signs of maltreatment are often ambiguous for adolescents. Screening questions have been effective in prompting self-disclosure of abuse. Adolescents also experience problems in the child welfare system that offers fewer and less appropriate services for this age group. Recommendations are made regarding screening of adolescents for maltreatment, the development of better services for adolescents, research on parenting to prevent maltreatment, and training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment.",

      "abstract": "The choice of a career for his son is, in general, a problem of great perplexity for a man, and, often, one which he is ill equipped to manage. He probably makes large sacrifices to defray the cost of a ‘good education,’ and is liable finally to sacrifice his boy’s chances of happiness and success by an injudicious decision about his future. His difficulties may be increased, curiously enough, by his failure to realise that conditions of entry into a career are radically different from what they were thirty or forty years ago. He perhaps is still sufficiently romantic to talk about, and even to believe in, the ‘self-made man’ ideal, although the impracticability of it in these days of combines and over-population is surely manifest. Or he is likely to adopt one of two favourite attitudes; either, that his personal experience of the exigencies of his own calling determines him not to allow his son to follow it, or that the only reasonable thing for a son to do is to step into his father’s shoes and continue the work built up for him. If he is neither romantic nor obstinate, he will consult his son’s inclinations and, in all probability, he will find them either fantastic or completely unformed. A normal boy rarely shows a marked aptitude for one particular business or profession in his early or middle school-days, and if he forms an opinion about his future it is usually much influenced by a limited knowledge of his father’s occupation.",

A relationship will, on the other hand, be called “closed” against outsiders so far as, according to its subjective meaning and its binding rules, participation of certain persons is excluded, limited, or subjected to conditions. Whether a relationship is open or closed may be determined traditionally, affectually, or rationally in terms of values or of expediency. It is especially likely to be closed, for rational reasons, in the following type of situation: a social relationship may provide the parties to it with opportunities for the satisfaction of spiritual or material interests, whether absolutely or instrumentally, or whether it is achieved through co-operative action or by a compromise of interests. If the participants expect that the admission of others will lead to an improvement of their situation, an improvement in degree, in kind, in the security or the value of the satisfaction, their interest will be in keeping the relationship open. If, on the other hand, their expectations are of improving their position by monopolistic tactics, their interest is in a closed relationship.",

Through looking-time experiments with 7- to 12-month-old infants, we show that preverbal infants expect members of social groups to act alike. Our findings further reveal that this expectation is specific to social groups, as infants did not expect similar actions from socially unrelated individuals or from groups of inanimate objects. Thus, an expectation that social affiliates will share behaviors arises early in human development, prior to language or to extensive experience with different social groups.",

Several studies have reported a second kind of behavioural anomaly in 47,XXY males. Despite difficulties in demonstrating this due to the absence of generally accepted methods of measurement, there is a significant body of data indicating that extra X males frequently present the signs of atypical interpersonal or temperamental development. The nature of the relationship indicates that extra X males with particularly pronounced right hemisphere specialization for nonverbal processing have the most severe language deficits. If disorders of hemispheric specialization underlie various aspects of behavioural abnormality in 47,XXY boys, it is appropriate to ask what is responsible for the neurological anomalies themselves. Identifying the factors that give rise to hemispheric specialization is complex, as is determining whether hemispheric specialization is relatively fixed early in life or, alternatively, is emergent and changing from birth to maturity.",

      "abstract": "People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are perceived as helpless, dependent, and unable to fulfil social roles assigned to the so-called able-bodied1 people. As a consequence, the entrance of the said group into adulthood is impeded and delayed. It is not for the lack of will on the part of the subject or as a consequence of intellectual disability, but rather as a result of the existing social situations which create barriers hindering the fulfilment of needs. A person with ID has a right to have needs and fulfil them. Among them there are specific needs – shaped by individual human characteristics, experiences, and development changes – which are related to the particular stage of the individual’s development. The aim of this research was to diagnose the specific needs of adults with intellectual disabilities at a moderate and severe level, while the main research problem consists of the following questions: what are the specific needs of adults with intellectual disabilities at a significant level (moderate and severe) between the ages of 18 and 35? Which of the indicated needs are being met by the research participants? The research was conducted by employing a quantitative strategy, using the author´s self-designed survey questionnaire. 96 people with intellectual disabilities were surveyed – the participants of the occupational therapy workshop (OTW). An analysis was conducted on the needs which, according to Erikson, most commonly manifest in adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 35). The test results reveal the actual state of their occurrence and fulfilment.",

To date, however, this research has focused almost exclusively on the experiences of heterosexual cisgender people, overlooking other diverse genders and/or sexualities. This article seeks to address this gap by reporting on findings from a study of 503 people living in Australia or the United Kingdom. Specifically, the research sought to explore links between psychological distress, social support, family violence, and views about animal companions. Notable among the findings was an interaction between having experienced familial violence and living with an animal companion, and the impact of both on psychological distress and social support. The article concludes by considering the implications of the findings for better understanding the lives of people of diverse genders and/or sexualities.",

They have put together a brilliant synthesis of history, case studies, ideas and positions as they have emerged over the past thirty years, and bring together a rich and grounded account of this field, providing a state of the art of critical concepts and ideas in this field further during the twenty first century.¹ Based on two decades of fieldwork, life history work, qualitative analysis, archival work and contact with several thousand cross-dressers and sex-changers around the world, these researchers have distinguished a number of contemporary Transgendering 'stories'. 'The assignment of an individual as being of the male or female sex is most often based on the phenotypic appearance of the external genitalia at birth, which is largely determined by the chromosomal type (most commonly 46,XX or 46,XY). Gender identity, however, is an individual's perceived or experienced gender, which may or may not be the same as one's sex assigned at birth. The concept of gender identity includes gradations of masculinity to femininity and maleness to femaleness, as well as identification of some individuals as having nonbinary gender, which means being essentially neither male nor female, or a combination of both. Gender nonconformity is behavioral variation in gender expression (e.g., clothing, mannerisms, accessories, and hairstyles) from cultural and societal norms expected for that gender. Sexual orientation is defined as the physical and emotional attraction of an individual to same-sex people (lesbian or gay; homosexual), both same-sex and opposite-sex people (bisexual), or opposite-sex people (heterosexual).² Transgender is an all-inclusive term that may include all individuals whose gender identity or expression does not align with their assigned birth sex and/or those whose gender identity is outside of the binary male/female classification'.².",

The case of si-nais (housewives) in Hong Kong shows that we can never assume that married women (or any social category) are privileged by virtue of their status on the sexual hierarchy. The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfilment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfilment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific elements, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

Older men and women aged 66-80 (N=17) who are married, healthy, and living in communities were interviewed regarding ADL, present and past sexual practices, prejudices on elderly sexuality, and obstacles to sexual life. The findings of this study are as follows: First, the old perceived that sexuality even in old age is an important part of life. However, they were also prejudiced about sexual intimacy in old age. Second, although an increase in age is correlated with a decrease in sexual activity, a number of older men and women continue to have active sexual life and they are satisfied with it as ever. This indicates a duality in the way the elderly perceive sexuality. Third, health status, partner's responsiveness, and environmental problems are prominent obstacles to sexual life. The study revealed that late-life sexuality must be conceived as a complex bio-psycho-social phenomenon. Consequently, it is important to hold sexual education programs for the young and the old.】",

      "abstract": "The old become narcissistic again—like children; much of their interest in family and social matters fades away, and they lose a great deal of their former capacity for sublimation, particularly in the sphere of shame and disgust. They become cynical, malicious, and mean; that is to say, their libido regresses to the 'pre-genital stages of development', and sometimes expresses itself in undisguised anal and urethral eroticism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and a tendency to masturbation. The process is apparently the same as that which Sigmund Freud describes as underlying paraphrenia; in both cases there is the same abandonment of object-cathexis and the same regression to narcissism. The exaggerated dissipation of sexual interests of many people at the climacteric is a symptom of over-compensation, of the healing tendency, while the real state of the distribution of the libido is represented by the ideas of impoverishment and guilt which accompany the patient's depression.",

      "abstract": "Forty-six adolescents with spina bifida were interviewed at home to find out how they felt about their situation. Some degree of misery was very common indeed but was more likely to be severe in girls than in boys. About half the girls had, on some occasion in the past year, felt that life was hopeless or not worth living. Since these feelings are related to their social isolation outside school, they might be alleviated by improved opportunities for contract with peers. This seems particularly important in view of the capacity of most teenagers to make reasonable relationships where the opportunity exists, e.g. at school or within the family. Over half those who had left school were either unemployed or very dissatisfied with their job. In addition to worries about work, preoccupations about sexual relatinships, sexual function, and marriage were common. About two-thirds of the teenagers hoped to get married and half of these thought they could have children. Girls were particularly worried about their capacity to conceive and boys had understandable concerns about potency. Very few had consulted anyone about this or had had advice about the genetic aspects of the condition and there is a clear need for adequate counseling to help such teenagers to distinguish between real and imagined fears about the consequences of their condition.",

The same rite is practiced by the contemporary hijras of India, a sect comprised of men who live as womcn and worship the goddess, Behuchara Mata. The practice of becoming a eunuch is sporadic in the annals of today's medical sexology and sex therapy. It represents a renunciation of sex, with or without a transsexual implication. It is a sexual body-image syndrome with three degrees of severity: fixation, neurosis or psychosis. Its etiology is obscure. It is subject to misdiagnosis, and to treatment that proves ineffectual. Once the status of eunuch has been achieved, the prognosis is from guarded to good. An autobiographical case report of self-castration and partial denervation of the penis illustrates a variant of the syndrome, which has proved to be self-limiting, with a good prognosis.",

      "title": "Affirmative sexual consent? Direct and unambiguous consent is rarely included in discussions of recent sexual interactions",
      "abstract": "Sexual activity typically follows an implicit sexual script or a normative sequence of behaviours that are involved in a sexual interaction. It is unclear whether or how affirmative sexual consent is incorporated in individual sexual scripts and interactions. The current research explores how sexual consent may be expressed and verified as part of individuals’ sexual interactions. Undergraduate participants from an Ontario university ( N = 92; 58 males, 34 females) completed a series of open-ended questions that asked them to describe their sexual experiences with a new and long-term partner from beginning to end. Analysis of presence of consent-related behaviours in participants’ accounts were assessed on the basis of a priori themes and extensions of these themes. Thematic analyses identified the following themes: 1) Sex proceeding with escalating intensity of nonverbal sexual behaviour, 2) Passive behaviours that do not indicate unwillingness to have sex, 3) Indirect verbal communication of interest in sex, 4) Indications that sex “just happened,” 5) Descriptions of the context in which sex occurred, and 6) Direct discussions relevant to sexual consent. Results indicated that direct discussion of sexual consent was exceedingly rare and that most sexual interactions included indirect, veiled, and coded behaviours that require inference of sexual consent or non-consent. Consent-related themes varied as a function of both participant gender (male versus female) and nature of relationship (new versus long-term). The findings of this study have implications for sexual health education, sexual assault prevention interventions, and public policy development.",

      "title": "Dani Sexuality: A Low Energy System",
      "abstract": "Based on 2 1/2 years of field research between 1961 and 1970 Heider describes and attempts to explain the extraordinarily low sexual activity particularly the long postpartum abstinence of a small group of Grand Valley Dani men in the central highlands of Irian Jaya Indonesia (West New Guinea). Characteristics of the postpartum sexual abstinence include: 1) 4-6 years of abstinence 2) consistent observation by the Dani of the abstinence 3) lack of explanation of the custom or the enforcement of sanctions by the Dani 4) lack of other sexual outlets in the society such as masturbation homosexuality beastiality or overt polygymy and 5) no signs of unhappiness or stress. The behavior and attitudes of the postpartum abstinence are described in detail. Low levels of emotional energy invested in sexuality are also observable in other activities of the Dani such as the rate of birth extramarital sex homosexuality child-rearing practices initiation rites use of the penis sheath or gourd teenagers play interpersonal interaction intelligence as reflected in abstract thinking and the expression of art and adaptation to change and health. In all but one of these activities e.g. teenagers play there is always a low expression of energy; teenagers songs drawings and string figures often illustrate explicit sexual actions. In comparison of the two views of sexual energy the relativistic and the more common Freudian ones Heider concludes that the Danis sexual behavior is culturally derived and fits closely with the view of Dani society as a low level energy system. Using comparative examples causes of low energy sexuality are suggested to be a result of the lack of seasonality in the region or more likely the low stress and stimulation of infants. However no causal factors seem sufficient enough to explain the phenomena of low level sexuality.",

Working in integrated teams and under the upcoming changes in reimbursement, primary care providers will be able to screen for, assess, treat, and/or refer sexual problems to colleagues within and outside of their practice. This requires a small but significant increase in the team’s level of knowledge about sex. Sexual problems have multiple etiologies: physical, including hormonal and structural, individual/psychological, and relationship-based. These causes interact with one another and require concurrent, rather than sequential, interventions. Major sexual problem areas include low and/or discrepant desire levels, difficulty becoming aroused (erectile dysfunction in men, low excitement in women), difficulty in achieving orgasm in women and men, premature ejaculation, and sexual pain in women. Working through integrated, multidisciplinary teams, much more can be done for patients in this important area of health.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough humans experience orgasms with a degree of statistical regularity, they remain among the most enigmatic of sexual responses; difficult to define and even more difficult to study empirically. The question of whether animals experience orgasms is hampered by similar lack of definition and the additional necessity of making inferences from behavioral responses.MethodHere we define three behavioral criteria, based on dimensions of the subjective experience of human orgasms described by Mah and Binik, to infer orgasm-like responses (OLRs) in other species: 1) physiological criteria that include pelvic floor and anal muscle contractions that stimulate seminal emission and/or ejaculation in the male, or that stimulate uterine and cervical contractions in the female; 2) short-term behavioral changes that reflect immediate awareness of a pleasurable hedonic reward state during copulation; and 3) long-term behavioral changes that depend on the reward state induced by the OLR, including sexual satiety, the strengthening of patterns of sexual arousal and desire in subsequent copulations, and the generation of conditioned place and partner preferences for contextual and partner-related cues associated with the reward state. We then examine whether physiological and behavioral data from observations of male and female rats during copulation, and in sexually-conditioned place- and partner-preference paradigms, are consistent with these criteria.ResultsBoth male and female rats display behavioral patterns consistent with OLRs.ConclusionsThe ability to infer OLRs in rats offers new possibilities to study the phenomenon in neurobiological and molecular detail, and to provide both comparative and translational perspectives that would be useful for both basic and clinical research.",

      "abstract": "For prepubertal youth, sexual stimuli elicit disgust and avoidance, yet in adolescence this avoidance shifts to sexual approach. One explanation could be that disgust declines in adolescence. This project examined whether disgust is indeed lower in adolescence compared to preadolescence, and whether this difference across age groups would be restricted to sex-relevant disgust elicitors. We also examined whether the strength of disgust would depend on familiarity between participant and source. To examine disgust responses in youths, two cross-sectional studies (N = 248, ages six to 17 years) were conducted using scenario-based measurements. Disgust was overall higher in early adolescence than in preadolescence and relatively weak when the source of disgust was a familiar person. Specifically, when parents were the source, sex-relevant disgust was higher in the groups of early and middle adolescents than in the group of preadolescents. Sex-relevant disgust elicited by a stranger or best friend, however, was lower in middle than in early adolescence. The latter is consistent with the view that repeated confrontation with disgusting stimuli might attenuate disgust, which could contribute to healthy sexual functioning. The heightened sex-relevant disgust in middle adolescents when parents were the source might reflect a functional avoidance mechanism of inappropriate sex mates.",

Significant sex differences, showing the male to be at a disadvantage, were found in performance on all scales.

Males, although they have the advantage of higher birthweight, do less well than females from birth through 4 years of age. Although these sex differences must have a basic genetic origin, it was suggested that such factors as obstetrical problems, neonatal distress, and maternal attitudes may have a mediating effect. Possible etiologic mechanisms were discussed.",

The purpose of this study was to understand what behaviors are typically considered to be masturbation as well as the situational and individual variables that may affect the labeling of a behavior as such. An online study of 564 individuals demonstrated that a wide variety of behaviors were considered to be masturbation by a majority of participants. No difference was found between men and women in the total number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Both men and women were more likely to label a behavior as masturbation (1) if there was no sexual partner present than if there was and (2) if an orgasm occurred than if it did not. In addition, women were more likely than men to label a behavior as masturbation if they were alone and if no orgasm occurred. Younger age was associated with labeling more behaviors as masturbation, but sexual identity, self-pleasuring experience, partnered sexual experience, and attitudes toward masturbation were not related to the number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Results speak to the importance of behavioral specificity when discussing masturbation with students, clients, and in sex research.",

      "abstract": "Critical or sensitive periods in the life of an organism during which certain experiences or conditions may exert disproportionate influence (either for harm or benefit) on long-term developmental outcomes have been the subject of investigation for over a century. This chapter reviews research in the context of the development of social preferences and sensory systems, with a summary of the criteria for defining such a period and the evidence necessary to establish its existence. The notion of nutritional programming, central to the Barker/Developmental Origins hypotheses of health and disease, represents a variant of the critical/sensitive period concept. It is implicit in these hypotheses that the fetal period is a time during which metabolic and physiological systems are malleable and thus susceptible to either insult or enhancement by nutrient intake. Evidence for critical/sensitive periods or nutritional programming requires a systematic manipulation of the age at which nutritional conditions or supplements are implemented. While common in research using animal models, the approach is difficult to establish in epidemiological studies and virtually nonexistent in human clinical trials. Future work seeking to establish definitive evidence for critical/sensitive periods or programming may be advanced by harmonized outcome measures in experimental trials across which the timing, duration, and dose of nutrients is varied.",

Clinical research and practice have clearly demonstrated that, although a person may be elderly, it does not mean that they are necessarily asexual.1, 2 In fact, studies of residents in long-term care facilities have revealed that many of these individuals remain interested in sex and that some remain sexually active in this environment.3, 4 The availability of a regular partner certainly influences the degree to which elderly individuals remain sexually active. Many older adults want to continue to experience the full range of sexual activities they enjoyed in younger years for as long as possible, but forms of sexual expression may also change with advancing age. For some older adults, masturbation may become a primary sexual outlet. In many cases, the simple acts of touch and physical intimacy may supplant penetrative sexual intercourse as highly meaningful and satisfying forms of sexual expression. Many factors can negatively influence sexual function in older adults. Significant comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease may limit genital blood flow. Impaired circulation may in turn lead to erectile dysfunction in men and diminished sensation or orgasmic dysfunction in women.5 Osteoarthritis and neurological disorders may impair physical mobility during intercourse and make certain sexual positions difficult or uncomfortable for older adults. Atrophic vaginitis is a common condition in postmenopausal women that may be associated with dyspareunia and decreased sexual activity.1 Hormonal changes may lead to alterations in libido for both men and women.2 Clinicians must ask specifically about sexual function, because many older adults will not volunteer this information or raise questions themselves.6 The study by Tannenbaum et al. in this issue examined the association between urinary incontinence and self-reported levels of sexual activity in a community-based postal survey of 5,000 Canadian women aged 55 and older.7 Particular strengths of this study were that it surveyed a broad range of women across the country and represented approximately 15% to 18% of the total female Canadian population. Data were available for 2,361 of the 5,000 women surveyed. The overall prevalence of urinary incontinence was 38%, and 27% of the women reported being sexually active. The authors found that continence status did not appear to influence participation in sexual activity for many older women. Age and marital status, a proxy measure for the availability of a sexual partner, were the strongest predictors of continued sexual activity. Although the frequency of incontinent episodes was not related to changes in sexual activity, overall physical and mental health did appear to influence this outcome. In addition, stress incontinence, nocturnal incontinence, and larger volumes of urine loss did appear to negatively affect sexual participation. The authors concluded that marital status and physical and mental health parameters must be considered in evaluating the results of intervention studies to improve sexual health in older incontinent women. In addition to the community-based design, other strengths included the exploration of multiple predictor variables such as overall physical and mental health and body image. There were also several potential limitations that the authors recognized and discussed. The results were based on a self-reported postal survey that may have some inherent response biases. The question on sexual activity was dichotomous and thus may not have accounted for varying levels or forms of sexual expression. Sexual satisfaction was also not measured in this study. The use of marital status as a proxy measure for a regular sexual partner was also potentially biased. This variable will not capture single women who may have a regular sexual partner, married women whose partner suffers from significant sexual dysfunction, or women who engage in sexual activity with other women. The generalizability of the research findings are also limited to relatively healthy, community-dwelling adults. Several other studies have examined the relationship between urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and decreased sexual function in women. One demonstrated that urinary incontinence was significantly associated with decreased libido, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia.8 These findings were independent of subject age. Another found that women with incontinence and prolapse were less sexually active than women without these problems.9 It also found that women who feared being incontinent during sexual intercourse had lower levels of sexual participation. Some studies have reported that pelvic organ prolapse may be associated with a significant reduction in sexual activity,10, 11 but other studies have been less conclusive.12 The etiology of incontinence during sexual intercourse is most likely multifactorial. Mechanical and nonmechanical factors may be involved.13 Some women only experience urinary incontinence at the time of orgasm. Studies have shown that women with incontinence during sexual activity report less overall satisfaction with the sexual act itself and lower health-related quality of life than women who do not leak urine.14, 15 The associations between urinary incontinence and low levels of sexual activity in women appear to cross multiple ethnic and cultural boundaries. Studies of women in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have also revealed relationships between urinary incontinence, decreased sexual activity, and diminished quality of life.16-19 Although similar studies in men have been limited, there is evidence to suggest that men with urinary incontinence may also decrease their level of sexual activity.15 Anecdotally, many prostate cancer survivors who suffer from postprostatectomy urinary incontinence describe limiting their sexual activity. Even if they are able to achieve and maintain an adequate erection, they may avoid sexual activity for fear of leaking on their partner. In some cases, use of a condom to catch the urine may be helpful. However, in patients with large volume leakage, this would not be an adequate solution. Studies examining the effect of therapies to improve continence status on sexual health in women have yielded mixed results. Some have demonstrated an associated improvement in sexual function,20 whereas others have shown little or no improvement after surgical correction of prolapse or incontinence.5, 10 Nevertheless, Tannenbaum et al. correctly noted that partner availability is often not measured in these studies of older women.7 Additional research will be needed to further elucidate the effects of incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse on sexual function in older adult women. Because partner availability is such a strong predictor of sexual activity in this population, this variable must be taken into account in epidemiological research and studies designed to examine targeted intervention outcomes. Depictions of human sexuality are pervasive in modern popular culture. This imagery is used to sell everything from automobiles to soda pop, but it is rare to see depictions of sexuality in the elderly population and then almost never in a positive light. There have been occasional exceptions, such as the television program The Golden Girls, which originally aired from 1985 to 1992. This program depicted four vibrant older women, all of whom were sexually active at some point during the series. Yet their continence status was unknown. Perhaps urinary incontinence is one of the last taboo topics for the mainstream media? The younger members of the Baby Boom generation came of age in the 1960s during the height of the sexual revolution in the United States. As this population cohort ages, they will likely be more open to discussing matters of sexuality and sexual health and the associated effects of age and comorbid conditions such as urinary incontinence. There is a critical need for additional research on normative sexual behavior in older adults, particularly with regard to female sexual function. The role of the living environment must also be considered. The sexual activity of community-dwelling older people may be quite different from those in assisted living or long-term care because of availability of privacy for sexual activity. Increasing numbers of older adults are living with family members, and this may be a limiting factor for sexual activity for some people. Despite the recent wave of research and clinical interest in treatment of erectile dysfunction in men, there are limited available data on the overall degree of sexual satisfaction experienced by elderly people. There has also been almost no published research on the relationship between quality of life and alternate forms of sexual expression including masturbation and simple physical intimacy in older adults. Additional scholarly work in the areas of urinary incontinence and geriatric sexuality will help to better clarify the complex relationships between these conditions. This enhanced knowledge may aid in the development of future therapies for sexual dysfunction for men and women. These could have profound effects on sexual health and its overall effect on quality of life. Financial Disclosure: Dr. Tomas L. Griebling had no financial support in preparation of this editorial.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTOlder adults remain sexually active well into later life; yet, there is no consistency in the literature about what sex means to them. The study described in this paper investigated the understanding of sexual activity as reported by 30 women and men from Poland, aged 65 to 82 (M = 71, SD = 5,24). Semi-structured interviews were thematically analyzed in relation to sexual scripts theory and the participants' specific sociocultural background. The results demonstrate the diversity of opinions on what sex is: from penetrative intercourse, through various expressions of physical intimacy, to emotional intimacy as a central concept. The dominant perception of sex as intercourse among some study participants evolved into an intimacy-oriented and partner-focused activity, with the discovery of fondling and female sexual pleasure as components of sex. Certain life events - such as ending a long-term marriage or engaging in a new romantic relationship - were identified as facilitating this change. Notable similarities in older women's and men's perceptions of satisfying sex in later life were observed. Acknowledging the nuanced meaning of sex for this population can contribute to a better understanding of the specificity of older adults' sexuality.",

Aversion is characterized by an unwillingness to get involved in sexual activity, with avoidance of any touching or communication that might lead to sexual involvement. This syndrome usually presents as a lack of libido, low sex drive, inhibited sexual desire or arousal dysfunction. Aversion may be seen along with other sexual dysfunctions, as a precipitating cause or as a consequence. However, aversion can also be the only dysfunction present. Once aversion is correctly diagnosed, identifying the type of aversion present is a prerequisite to appropriate therapy. Primary and secondary aversion are treated differently and have a different prognosis.

Clitoral stimulation to orgasm per se or to facilitate orgasm even during PVI, however, is not beneficial to women’s, psychological, interpersonal or behavioural health and can lead to ‘noxious consequences’.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Racial violence arises when infantile anxiety and hatred of ‘difference’ or ‘otherness’ become too unmanageable within the self and are displaced into the racial arena via splitting and projective mechanisms. The body of the ‘other’, particularly skin colour differences, becomes a salient target for locating and attacking these feared and unwanted aspects of the self. Those on the receiving end can experience a profound attack on their identity, with feelings of rejection that can result in a severe narcissistic blow, puncturing and even shattering the individual's psychic skin and existing defensive organization. This failure of containment can send tremors throughout the psyche to some of the most vulnerable areas in individuals functioning, giving fresh life to both oedipal and pre‐oedipal anxieties to do with separation and loss. Where these early anxieties are felt to be unbearable, the individual resorts to encapsulating them in a portion of their mind, effectively sealing them off from conscious awareness or access, but they are unconsciously re‐enacted. A case study aims to describe some of these phenomena.",

We tested preschoolers’ predictions about the prosocial or antisocial manner in which people would behave toward each other. Four stories were presented to 3- and 4-year-old children. In each story, the protagonists could either cooperate, act in terms of their own interests, or adopt a behavior unrelated to the ongoing scenario. Children as young as 3 years of age expected the protagonists to behave prosocially – and even more so if the protagonists were female. The results suggest that, even at an early age, children are inclined to adopt a “Rousseau-like” stance rather than a “suspicious” or “pessimistic” Hobbesian stance.",

Reactions are operationalized in terms of expressed rejection of the homosexual as indicated by responses to a social distance scale. The major variables examined are sex of homosexual, sex of reactor, and acceptance of two commonly held stereotypes. These stereotypes—perceived danger and psychological disturbance—both suggest that a sense of threat is associated with rejection of the homosexual. A particularly interesting finding was that male subjects are especially rejecting of male homosexuals. Presumably male subjects tend to view the male homosexual as a sexual failure and to perceive him as personally threatening or dangerous.",

      "abstract": "Mental retardation denotes sub-average intellectual functioning, based on IQ, i.e. the inability of normal learning, accompanied by behavioral and developmental disorders. Persons with impairments (cognitive, motor, sensory or psychiatric) have often been, both through human history and today victims of discrimination and deprived of their basic human rights, both in the public and the private life spheres. Since the end of the 20th century, throughout the developed world, many disabled persons can accomplish their dreams and rights. However, the issue of sexuality is still an obstacle in realizing oneself as a whole person, of course in accordance with personal psychophysical abilities. The greatest problem is present in persons with severe disablement, considered not apt enough for information on sexuality and for expressing themselves as persons with their own sexual needs. Thus it is desirable to observe each disabled person individually and flexibly enough in order to establish parameters for the functioning of an intimate affair on the level of understanding and assent. The legal system must protect the most vulnerable and ensure for them the right of choice and consent, as well as the possibility of fulfilling their sexual needs, so that they could love and be loved. Naturally, the system must be built on foundations that satisfy the needs of its users, but also of persons engaged in work with them. Sex education should contain information regarding biological, socio-cultural and spiritual dimensions of sexuality, including cognitive, affective and behavioral domains. Unfortunately, very few educational programs with such aims provide sex education, not only for the disabled young population but also for the healthy. This review article is based on international investigations and Croatian legislative postulates. Its aim is to focus the attention of both professionals and non-professionals on this delicate problem.",

      "title": "Domestic Violence: A Problem And How It Affects Children's Psyche",
      "abstract": "The majority of victims of domestic violence have always been women, and this pattern has persisted into the 21st century. Regardless of their age, religion, caste, or social status, women from all social backgrounds are affected by domestic abuse. Domestic abuse, however, can also afflict men, children, and the elderly in addition to women. All facets of society and demographics are impacted by domestic violence. Domestic abuse refers to a pattern of abusive behaviour done by one partner to take or maintain control over a romantic partner. It can happen in any kind of partnership. Any pattern of coercive behaviour that negatively impacts a person in an intimate partner relationship, regardless of whether it is physical, sexual, emotional, economical, psychological, or technical, is considered domestic abuse. No matter a person's ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, religion, sex, or gender identity, domestic abuse can affect them. Domestic abuse affects people from all socioeconomic backgrounds and educational degree. Intimate partners who are married, residing together, dating, or who are parents together might experience domestic violence. In both same sex and opposite partnerships, it is possible. The victims of domestic abuse, as well as their family, friends, workplace, any witnesses, and the community at large, are all significantly impacted. Domestic violence has a detrimental effect on many people, including children who endure it as they grow up. Frequent exposure to violence in the home teaches children that abuse is a normal part of life, which increases the likelihood that they will grow up to be society's next victims and abusers in addition to exposing them to a number of physical and social problems. Abuse in the home is nothing new. It has been a part of societies all around the world for a very long time. The goal of a growing initiative in the second half of the 20th century was to raise awareness of this enduring societal problem. As a result, legislation was passed by the federal and state governments to safeguard victims and hold violent offenders accountable. 1994 saw the initial passage of the Federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). It generously supports programmes to stop domestic violence. Domestic violence is a severe public . According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 26% of men and 41% of women have experienced intimate partner violence at some point in their life. All three types of abuse are mentioned in reports of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and stalking to law enforcement.",

      "abstract": "When atypical sexual behaviors, desires, and/or fantasies (sometimes called paraphilia or kink) cause distress and are non-consensual, harmful to oneself and/or others, and intense and persistent, they may be labeled as a Paraphilic Disorder. Paraphilic Disorders have been a source of controversy, and at times it may be difficult to differentiate Paraphilic Disorders from negative societal views of sexuality. Although an individual diagnosis, Paraphilic Disorders often have a profound effect on couple relationships. This chapter explores specific ways to assess, diagnose, and intervene with Paraphilic Disorders from a systemic perspective.",

      "abstract": "Many different personality types were represented in this study as has been described by various observers. The major factor motivating the sexual behaviour of these women was the overwhelming importance to them of maintaining the dependent relationship upon a male with a total and blind acquiescence to his wishes. Of lesser importance were acting out against parents, a strong sexual drive, the need to prove oneself a woman and a desire, conscious or unconscious, to have a baby. Much guilt was aroused by the use of or insistence on birth control measures; these implied responsibility for sexual activity, the use of such measures was precluded. Contrary to other reports, nausea, vomiting and obstetrical complications occurred with the same frequency as in married women. The course of the pregnancy did not appear to be affected in any way. It was concluded that a weak ego structure was more basic to their behaviour than the unconscious drive to have a baby, or the acting out of unconscious fantasies which often have been assumed in the previous literature. The results suggest that the mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is of physiological rather than psychological origin, and that the course of pregnancy is not as readily affected by unhealthy motivation for having the baby as has often been assumed.",

      "title": "Human trafficking as a form of organized crime: Main phenomenological features",
      "abstract": "Human trafficking is a complex socio-pathological phenomenon based on (historical) institutions of slavery and exploitation, i.e. on treating a man as goods or a thing, in order to exploit his labor power, knowledge and skills, bodily and sexual integrity in order to satisfy one's own or someone else's instinct, health or emotional needs or in order to gain direct or indirect material profit for oneself or somebody else. Certain forms of slavery and exploitation of persons known from ancient times can be seen today in identical form (public selling of victims, working exploitation in agricultural and home sector, sexual exploitation, forced participation in armed conflicts) or in modified forms (working exploitation in industrial sector, illegal adoption), and there are completely new forms (trafficking in bodily organs or parts, performing medical experiments, forced pregnancy, and similar). On the other hand, manifesting forms of trafficking do not differ in practice from some other similar phenomena primarily smuggling of migrants, prostitution and work of illegal migrants in so-called black economy sector. This is why it has been pointed to the main features of this phenomenon. The conclusion is that trafficking is a multi-manifesting phenomenon, and this is why it is very difficult to come to a comprehensive, generally accepted classification of its manifesting forms. The offered classification of forms of trafficking according to the degree of social danger, geographical level of implementation, physical and biological characteristics of victims and relation of victim to his/her position, in principle, does not exclude the possibility of some other classification. The cases of trafficking in practice can almost always be identified as some of possible combination of previously mentioned forms and types. In addition to being a multi-manifesting, trafficking is also a multi-structural phenomenon. The process of its realization, in principle, consists of four stages with many sub-stages within each of them. The dominant moments in realization of trafficking are certainly recruiting of victims, their transport, exploitation and elimination. Finally, trafficking is exceptionally developed and represented activity of organized criminal groups, more and more oft en transnational in scope. Excessive demand for sexual services increased the excessive demand for the victims of trafficking, but also the division of jobs among criminal organizations, their specialization and tendency to create monopole position at human market, which is more and more characterized by marketing, work of agencies, rules of business operations and other epithets of modern economic management. There are huge possibilities of profit since the victims can be exploited in many various ways. The knowledge of the main characteristics of certain forms of trafficking is an important condition to identify these complex and dynamic phenomena in practice, then to distinguish the trafficking from other similar security problems as well as to identify active and passive subjects in trafficking.",

      "abstract": "If we are to understand why it is so rare and what the future holds, the topic of body positivity in males has evolved into a complex one that requires discussion. Men frequently encounter irrational expectations that result in body dissatisfaction and a low sense of self- worth in todays society, when media representations of the ideal male form and gender stereotypes predominate. The medias depiction of the ideal male body, which is characterized by muscular proportions and low body fat, is a major reason man are not positive about their bodies. These restrictive rules put pressure on men to conform, which can cause body dissatisfaction and a decrease in self- esteem. Furthermore, the traditional gender roles of men and women indicate the idea that men should be portrayed as strong, stoic, and emotionally controlled, which discourages open conversations about body image issues and the need for assistance. The psychological and mental toll it takes on a person can cause various issues in men, both physically and mentally. It may be caused by constant pressure to meet these standards. Feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction can also be a contributing factor. It can lead to chronic problems in life. The most important part of maintaining a healthy state of mind is managing these body image concerns. In men, theres a lot of ways to support positive body image. Through education and awareness programs, these programs challenge harmful beauty norms and promote positive body image. Resources and workshops to help men reject outdated ideas and accepting body positivity need to be provided by schools, organizations, and communities. Its critical that we dismantle obstacles when it comes to mens body image. The secret to building an environment where guys can talk about their issues and receive assistance without fear of judgment is to have open dialogues about topics like how they feel about their bodies and mental health. Social media can also be a useful tool for promoting campaigns that celebrate the diversity of peoples bodies and for sharing fascinating tales that people can relate to.",

      "title": "Male infertility: an obstacle to sexuality?",
      "abstract": "Summary Interactions between infertility and sexuality are numerous and complex. Infertile men may suffer from sexual dysfunction (SD) when undergoing an assisted reproductive technology programme. We undertook a review both in French and English of the available data on male SD when being diagnosed with a fertility problem with a specific focus on azoospermic men. The review was performed over a 30‐year time period using PubMed/Medline. The sexual concerns and needs of infertile/sterile men for whom potential parenting can be compromised were evaluated. When diagnosed with infertility, men usually go through a crisis that can have a deleterious effect on their sexuality with sometimes a feeling of sexual inadequacy. Infertile men will feel stigmatized because they are perceived as being deficient in a specific component of their masculinity. Hence, subsequent SD may occur that can impact the couple sexuality and the infertility management. However, little is known on how the announcement of azoospermia may affect male on a sexual and psychological point of view. The present review suggests that a global management through a healthcare network (biologist, andrologist, sexologist and psychologist) is required which will allow to consider infertility and its subsequent sexual disorders as a whole and not as dichotomized issues.",

Schiller's designation of the \"happy infant\" is at least applicable to the healthy, well-cared-for child. There are painful emotions of many kinds—of which we shall speak later on—but these are no more than the shorter interludes of a chronic state of well-being and delight. The instinctive character of the expressional movements calls our attention to still deeper connections between feelings of pleasure and displeasure on the one hand and the child's instinctive life on the other. The psychoanalysts look upon these instances of organic pleasure and the child's actions connected with them as a proof of the existence of infantile sexuality, and speak of sucking ecstasy, \"infantile-onanie\", etc.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Men score higher than women on measures of sensation-seeking, defined as a willingness to engage in novel or intense activities. This sex difference has been explained in terms of evolved psychological mechanisms or culturally transmitted social norms. We investigated whether sex differences in sensation-seeking have changed over recent years by conducting a meta-analysis of studies using Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale, version V (SSS-V). We found that sex differences in total SSS-V scores have remained stable across years, as have sex differences in Disinhibition and Boredom Susceptibility. In contrast, the sex difference in Thrill and Adventure Seeking has declined, possibly due to changes in social norms or out-dated questions on this sub-scale. Our results support the view that men and women differ in their propensity to report sensation-seeking characteristics, while behavioural manifestations of sensation-seeking vary over time. Sex differences in sensation-seeking could reflect genetically influenced predispositions interacting with socially transmitted information.",

      "abstract": "Once a body is named or interpellated as either ‘boy’ or ‘girl’, they will be expected to convey, communicate, relate and/or display a social gender that co-ordinates with the labelled sex. This is part of the process known as cis-gendering. 1 I propose that emotions are also socialized during this process and are expected to be communicated and displayed to co-ordinate with the named social gender. This ensures that bodies remain uncontestably cis-gendered and heterosexual. The interpellation of emotion for feeling is thus a major part of the socialization process used to construct cis-gendered bodies. In comparison, those people who feel uncomfortable doing their named social gender because it is at odds with their labelled sex may claim a trans 2 gender identity. This incorporates a wide range of self-identities including a gender-queer or non-binary 3 identity (neutrois.me; transmediawatch.org). This article aims to explore how feelings are experienced in relation to a trans-gendered identity and what these mean for understanding and doing gender as ‘non-binary’. Using quotes from genderqueerconfession.com written by those who identify as members of a non-binary gendered community, I present a contemporary analysis of how gender is being re-interpreted and performed so that people may experience feelings they describe as either, both or neither ‘male’ or ‘female’. Findings show how gender becomes dis-orientated and takes up a liminal space where bodies and emotions are re-negotiated according to an emerging paradigm of trans-emotionality. 4 No longer confined to a restrictive binary system, I argue that gender is an affectively embodied process that is constantly imagined, embodied, re-imagined and re-embodied.",

Aside from the generally low likelihood of injury from drawing blood, the harms that might result to subjects once the genetic data is obtained range from minor to major, from physiological to psychosocial and even economic. Disclosure of results may cause loss or increased cost of health and/or life insurance, discrimination and stigmatization. In this presentation, I am going to discuss the issue through the followings: Privacy and confidentiality Unlike other kinds of health data, genetic information applies to or is about more than one person. (parents, siblings, children, and perhaps others). Research that includes follow-up studies requires that a subjects unique information be linked to the genetic information. For this and other reasons, many investigators seek to unlink personal identifiers from genetic data or biological specimens. Successful unlinking reduces or eliminates some threats to privacy and confidentiality. Informed consent The participant should be adequately informed. Consent should be free from coercion or undue influence. The participant should be fully competent. Risks of harm The idea of testing can cause pre- and post-test anxiety. Disclosure of results may result in employment and social bias, discrimination and stigmatization. Family members of the index subject may face similar risks of harm.

Moreover, these manifestations may be physical ailments directly referable to the injury, or, more commonly, they may represent symbolic behavioral manifestations of the injury.

Of all the theories of adolescence it is evident that the psychoanalytic and sociological approaches have had the widest impact. However the two are clearly different from each other. The psychoanalytic view takes as its starting point the upsurge of instincts which is said to occur as a result of puberty. Puberty, and the physical growth that accompanies it, is important to those involved in education for a number of reasons. Changes in intellectual functioning during the teenage years have implications for a wide range of behaviours and attitudes.",

The second position is the \"inversion of intensity\" hypothesis, which posits that intense behavior in the newborn predicts low activity in the third year of life, and newborn behavior which is-lacking in intensity predicts high activity at this time. Paradoxically, support for both positions is found in the present study of girls and boys from birth to 6 years of age.",

      "abstract": "Masa remaja merupakan masa yang sangat rentan. Pada tahap remaja, kepribadian dan karakter individu mulai terbentuk. Ada beberapa tahapan pada masa remaja, salah satunya adalah remaja akhir. Pada tahap remaja akhir terdapat banyak perubahan yang akan muncul sebagai bentuk pengembangan diri, diantaranya mengenal lawan jenis, jatuh cinta, dan mulai berkembangnya alat reproduksi. Salah satu faktor terjadinya pernikahan dini di Bangka Belitung disebabkan oleh seks pranikah. Teknik pengumpulan data pada artikel ini menggunakan studi kepustakaan. Dengan menggunakan perspektif psikodinamika dan teori psikoseksual yaitu adanya dorongan dan kebutuhan seksual yang harus terpenuhi, serta pengaruh emosional yang menjadi faktor utama seseorang melakukan dan menyalurkan aktivitas seksualnya. Hal ini berkaitan dengan hasil penelitian yang mengungkapkan bahwa perilaku seks bebas tidak hanya disebabkan oleh faktor lingkungan tetapi juga didorong oleh diri sendiri. Selain itu, individu yang melakukan hubungan seks pranikah cenderung mengalami kerentanan dan mengganggu fungsi sosial. Adolescence is a very vulnerable period. At the adolescent stage, individual personalities and characters begin to form. There are several stages in adolescence, one of which is late adolescence. At the late adolescence stagemany changes will appear as a form of self-development, including knowing the opposite sex, falling in love, and starting to develop reproductive organs. One of the factors in the occurrence of early marriage in Bangka Belitung is premarital sex. The data collection technique in this article uses a literature study. By using a psychodynamic perspective and psychosexual theory, namely the existence of sexual urges and needs that must be met, as well as emotional influences which are the main factors for a person to carry out and channel sexual activity. This is related to the results of research which reveals that free sex behavior is not only caused by environmental factors but is also driven by oneself. In addition, individuals who have premarital sex tend to experience vulnerability and interfere with social functioning.",

These traits are egocentricity, supersensitiveness, irritability, emotional poverty and stiffness of mentation. It is asserted that the character faults are present even before the appearance of the seizures. Increasing slowness and diminished capacity for any kind ofactivity is said to occur long before the epileptic disorder manifests itself. In recent years, Clark 1 has formulated the conception that epilepsy should be looked on as a psychobiologic disorder, and he regards it as an outflow from the homosexual component which is not sublimated or accepted. According to this point of view, the epileptic make-up is deep-rooted in narcissism, which results from poorly repressed homosexuality. The extroverted sexual life of epileptic persons is said to cease somewhere between 25 and 30 years of age, and the whole libido is then focused",

Sex of the absent parent was found to be correlated with the type behavior manifested; absence of the father with acting-out and absence of the mother with acting-in behavior. This relationship existed regardless of whether parental absence precipitated the problematic behavior or merely aggravated and caused pre-existing problems to become worse. The propensity of children of absent fathers to act-out and of absent mothers to act-in was shown to be related to whether children were aware of their parents' incarceration. This association was true of those children who were told their parents were in prison but untrue of those offspring who were led to believe that their mother or father was absent for other more socially acceptable reasons.",

      "abstract": "In self-report questionnaires, men report higher scores than women on variables such as desire for sex, frequency of sexual thoughts, number of sex partners, etc. Based on this, men are considered to have a higher level of sexual motivation than women. However, retrospective self-reports may be unsuitable for estimations of the inherent level of sexual motivation. We review data on automatic (unconsciously controlled) responses and measures of implicit motivation during exposure to sexual stimuli. These responses and measures are inaccessible to willful manipulations and make it possible to determine whether the sex difference in answers to questionnaires is replicated when volitional response manipulations are unlikely. We complement the human data with observations from some rodent and non-human primate species. The attentional resources allotted to stimuli with sexual relevance as well as genital responses to such stimuli are similar in men and women. Measures of implicit motivation also fail to detect any sex difference. Finally, the frequency of masturbation is superior in female infants before the age at which social expectations begin to determine behavior. Neither in rodents nor in non-human primates is there any clear-cut evidence for sex differences in motivation. It seems that males and females are similar with regard to the intensity of sexual motivation. The responses to questionnaires may be affected by social learning of sexual scripts and/or the inferior quality of sexual experiences in women, among other things.",

      "abstract": "The female menopause is considered to be a result of a decrease in the endocrinal metabolic activity of the ovaries. Although the male lacks such a highly visible sign as the cessation of the menstrual flow, the amount of testosterone produced by the aging male does in fact decrease. Recent studies, such as the Massachusetts Male Aging Study show that, between the ages of 40 to 70 years, the mean testosterone level decreases annually by about 1%. Chronic diseases and the use of drugs have a comparable effect. Although it is generally believed that sexual impotence is a major symptom of male menopause, recent investigations have shown that sexual functionability may be preserved into the ninth and tenth decade of life. Sexuality is not merely an instinct or a psychological expression, but is deeply anchored within the personality. Even when, with increasing age, the frequency of sexual dysfunction increases, such changes do not correlate with the decrease in testosterone levels. None of these phenomena take place within an age span that marks them off from the involution processes in other organs. The expression midlife crisis commonly met with in the English literature points up the psycho-social implications. Impotence or a loss of sexuality is not a sequel of aging, but of attitude towards sexuality. The latter is preserved if it is not neglected throughout the course of a lifetime.",

Je diskutováno 6 lidských sexuálních systémů. 1: Hlídání partnera a soutěž spermatu je motivací pouze pro muže, 2: V páru je pokračující sexuální receptivita ženy signálem pro kooperaci s můžem zajišťujícím jeho otcovství, čímž se zajišťuje otcovská kooperace muže. 3: Mnohočetná reprodukce je pro muže výhodná a může zvýšit jeho reprodukční úspěch. Obě pohlaví jsou vybavena motivačními mechanismy pro mimopárovou reprodukci. 4: Skrytá, neho přinejmenším nemanifestovaná, ovulace člověka podporuje stálou přítomnost a častou kopulaci, napomáhá tomu i rozložení cyklu ženy v průběhu celého roku. 5: Za vhodných podmínek může kopulace spustit neurochemické odpovědi, které posilují vazbu u obou pohlaví. Zdá se tedy, že sexuální motivace je spojena se systémem vazby, která je však dostatečně volná, aby umožňovala i mimopárovou alternativu. 6: Ženské tělo je zvláště dobře vybaveno, aby monitorovalo životní situace v souvislosti s reprodukčními možnostmi a také podle toho regulovalo fertilitu. Protože sexuální motivace je regulována stejnými hormonálními mechanismy, je propojena s ženským sledováním prostředí.",

Resultados : Las adultas mayores definen la sexualidad de forma heterogenea, le confieren gran importancia, a pesar de considerarla propia de edades mas jovenes y priorizando otras actividades mas aceptadas culturalmente. Se perciben en un lugar inferior en relacion a los hombres de esta edad y al resto de la familia. Se identifico el prejuicio que limita su satisfaccion de la esfera sexo-erotica de la sexualidad como una forma de violencia de genero en un grupo importante de ellas. Conclusiones : Las adultas mayores, por las exigencias de la familia, desplazan la dimension de pareja y las relaciones sexo-eroticas de su sexualidad, colocandolas en un escalon social inferior, lo que se traduce en una manifestacion de violencia de genero.",

Several hypotheses about the impact of hemophilia are described. First, the illness identity of the person with chronic disease threatens to supercede the masculine gender identity. Second, an unappreciated high prevalence of orientation and intention problems lurk behind the high frequency of heterosexual “shyness”. Suggestions to maximize the sexual developmental potential of young hemophiliacs are provided based on our current concepts of child development and sexual development in particular.",

The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfillment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfillment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific element, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

      "abstract": "Abstrak Pelecehan seksual atau pun pencabulan pada dasarnya adalah merupakan bagian dari kekerasan gender, artinya kedua bentuk tindak pelanggaran terhadap hak perempuan ini dilakukan bukan semata-mata karena faktor spontanitas atau sekedar penyaluran libido para lelaki yang sudah tak bisa lagi di tunda melainkan peristiwa ini terjadi karena di belakang benak pelaku maupun korban. Dalam berbagai kasus pencabulan atau kekerasan seksual lainya, sering kali yang dipersalahkan adalah pihak korban. Pengertian cabul adalah sesutau yang melanggar kesusilaan yang dilakukan dengan perbuatan-perbuatan. Bagi pelaku pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur ini sering disebut dengan istilah phedofilia yaitu suatu suatu istilah dari ilmu kejiwaan yaitu phedofil yang artinya dapat disimpulkan ialah melampiaskan hasrat seksual kepada anak-anak. Pada faktor kejiwaan yang menyimpang inilah yang merupakan salah satu faktor yang mempengaruhi terjadinya tindak pidana perkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur. Penyebab penyakit Phedofilia ini sangat bervariasi ada yang berupa trauma sewaktu kecil akibat pernah disodomi ataupun ketidaksukaan terhadap orang dewasa akan tetapi lebih menyukai anak-anak di bawah umur dalam hal hubungan seksualnya. Bahwa mengenai pertimbangan hakim dalam memutus tindak pidana pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak dibawah umur dalam putusan Pengadilan Negeri Tangerang No. perkara 1616/PID.SUS/2014/PN.TNG dengan terdakwa Adang Supena bin (alm) Djaidi, hakim telah mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor yang meringankan maupun yang memberatkan yang ada pada diri terdakwa, seperti sifat baik dan jahat dari pelaku, motif dan tujuan dilakukannya tindak pidana, cara melakukan, keadaan sosial ekonomi, dan pengaruh pidana terhadap masa depan pelaku, korban maupun keluarga korban. Faktor-faktor yang dapat meningkatkan dan mempengaruhi terjadinya tindak pidana pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur yaitu factor lingkungan, faktor kebudayaan, faktor ekonomi, faktor media, dan factor psikologi atau kejiwaan pelaku. Dalam kasus ini pertimbangan hakim dalam menjatuhkan pidana adalah pertimbangan dari segi pembuktian perbuatan pidana dan berdasarkan pertimbangan sisi kebenaran formal (kenbenaran menurut hukum) di mana semua unsur dalam dakwaan telah dapat dibuktikan dan pertimbangan dari sisi kebenaran mutlak (kebenaran materil) seperti pengakuan terdakwa, alat bukti, keyakinan dalam diri hakim dan lain-lainnya.

For many, the relationship progressed rapidly; over one half moved in with partners within 6 months of initiating romantic relationships. Primary reasons for cohabiting included finances, convenience, and housing needs; cohabiting as a trial marriage was not mentioned as the principal reason for moving in together.

      "abstract": "This study systematically examines the role of informal social response in the emergence of involuntary childlessness or infertility as a stigmatizing attribute. Seventy‐one involuntarily childless women provide detailed instances of perceived informal social sanctions related to their infertility. Subjects perceive that normals consider infertility to be caused by psychological or sexual malfunctioning, or by the woman in the dyad. Infertility is also seen by some to act as a master status. Subjects categorize other infertile individuals in terms of stigma and consider male infertility to be more stigmatizing than female infertility. Social sanctions and social control are shown to be relevant to an understanding of the experience of involuntary childlessness.",

There is consistent evidence that a history of physical or sexual abuse is a risk factor and some evidence for other risk factors, including poor family or parent-child communication, loss of caregiver to separation or death, and psychopathology in first-degree relatives. However, the researchers of the vast majority of studies did not attend to whether the putative risk factors preceded the development of suicidal symptoms; thus, most of the claims regarding family risk factors are not justified by their research designs and findings.",

      "abstract": "There is one topic that is guaranteed to polarise any group that discusses it, and that is sex. The perception of what is sexually perverted shifts dependent on who is talking about it. A person’s profession, gender, age, race, proclivities, education and even which century they live in, have all effected the viewpoint on sex and sexual perversions. For example, homosexuality has long been stigmatised as sexually perverted, (and remains so among some portions of society), but psychological and medical professionals no longer consider it pathological. Even the term perversion is controversial. Psychologists generally refer to non-traditional sexual behaviour as sexual deviation or, in cases where the specific object of arousal is unusual, as paraphilia. There are a number of clinically recognised disorders of sexual or paraphiliac function, including fetishism (the object of sexual desire is either an inanimate object or a non-genital part of the human anatomy), voyeurism (the covert viewing of other individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaged in sexual activity) and chronophilia (the primary sexual attraction is to a particular age group). Many of these behaviours are punishable by law. Although rape is not classified as a paraphilia, it is a serious sexual deviance, and perhaps the most highly reviled form of sexual gratification. \r\nThis lecture will explore forms of sexual deviance and sexual violence that come to the attention of forensic psychology, and outline the psychological theories that attempt to explain why some people find sexual gratification in unusual and illegal ways. You may be surprised at the ways in which the law impinges upon sex.",

The relational systems of subjugation that maintain such states of terror must, of necessity, destroy any authentic civic space in which individuals can flourish. Similar dynamics characterize child abuse within families. Survival requires the use of varied strategies, the most extreme of which are dissociative in nature, and that result in marked distortions of developmental trajectories across all psychological domains. Such dynamics are mirrored in dissociative systems that, in the absence of intervention, perpetuate the trauma of non-recognition by subjugation and self-objectification, or by omnipotent denial of others' subjectivity. All abusive systems are facilitated by bystanders, whose awareness of what is disavowed is always partial, resulting in a state of knowing and not-knowing. As dynamics shift, bystanders may behave like victims—passive, helpless, frightened and frozen, or like perpetrators—taking vicarious and voyeuristic pleasure in abuse or actively aiding and abetting the abusers.",

Apart from the physical aspects, sexuality involves complex cognitive and social-emotional developmental processes including capacity for intimacy, affiliation, communication, mutual respect and responsibility. A variety of risks may affect sexuality development at any stage and facet of it. To support healthy sexuality functioning in the female adolescent, physicians need to identify early risk markers, some of which are biological and others intrapsychic or sociocultural.

The empirically defined developmental stage of each man at age 47 and many other facets of each man's life course were rated by judges blind to other data. The studies identified a well-defined, career consolidation stage that falls between Erikson's stages of intimacy and generativity. The results support three hypotheses. First, the stages of men's life cycle must be passed through sequentially; failure to master one stage usually precludes mastery of subsequent stages. Second, the age at which a given stage is mastered varies enormously. Third, the stage attained by middle life appears quite independent of childhood social class or education, although adult maturation is correlated with whether childhood was conducive to basic trust, autonomy, and initiative.",

      "abstract": "“When you’re married well people suppose you want to do it and I don’t and I never have really. It must be like shagging a bag of potatoes really and I can’t even see what he gets out of it”. Here Karen, a 53 year old mental health service user, talks about her emotional and bodily indifference to vaginal penetration in terms of sexual relations with her husband. From a prima facie perspective, we are presented with the dominant cultural discourses of heterosexual marital rights and one woman’s lack of sexual desire, or frigidity. Nevertheless, Karen’s narratives are more complex than this and weave between the self-regulation of outward appearance to avoid the familial ‘gaze’ of certain behaviours imbued within her diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and the submissive, ritualised bodily performance of allowing unwanted sexual intercourse to occur. Compliancy within the hegemonic parameters of sexuality and appearance however afford Karen to seek her own ways of achieving sexual satisfaction namely, in her secret acts of self-harming. In this way, her vagina functions as an apparatus to both stabilise her physical and emotional position of well-being as well as mediating her subversive hidden pleasures.",

Gender is a collection of roles recognised as being typical for representatives of a given sex, particular behaviour and personality traits. We describe them respectively as structural, symbolic and emotional dimensions of masculinity and femininity. The aim of the article is to provide an answer to the question of how gender affects the identity of singles – those who are neither parents or partners. Considered are independently: work, family, home and free time on the basis of information obtained from interviews and the European Social Survey. This leads to the conclusion that work and home are areas where sex has less impact on the life of a single than on that of other members of the society. Singles’ femininity and masculinity manifest themselves mainly symbolically during their free time. Typical for people living alone is that they consciously shape their behaviour as feminine, masculine or neutral.&#x0D;",

Although the research seems to have validated sexual narcissism as a characteristic of borderline and histrionic personality disorders, it is yet to be tested with narcissistic personalities. In an effort to further explore this relationship as well as the validity of sexual narcissism, this study systematically compared a sample (ages 24-33 years) of males with narcissistic personality disorder with an adequately matched sample of males without personality disorders. As compared to the control group, narcissistic men were found to have significantly lower self-esteem, more negative attitudes toward sex, greater egocentric patterns of sexual behavior, more conservative or traditional gender-role orientation, and greater sexual preoccupation. Despite these findings, there were no significant differences between the groups on sexual depression and the narcissistic men evidenced significantly higher sexual esteem. Implications for these findings are discussed.",

      "title": "SEQUENCE OF FUNCTIONAL SEXUAL PHASES IN TEREDO",
      "abstract": "Examination of the gonads of 2,987 specimens of Teredo navalis of all ages, at all seasons, and during three successive years supplements the conclusions previously published regarding the sequence of sexual phases in this species. The functional phase, if any, in which any given individual is found will, in general, depend upon: a, age; b, size; c, season; d, season when hatched; e, its particular combination of genetic factors.Each normal individual shows a tendency toward an alternating series of functional sexual phases. There is good evidence that at least four of these phases may sometimes be completed in a lifetime of less than two years, although the average individual experiences hardly more than one or two.Among the variable sequences of phases which different individuals may experience the following may be considered typical:1. Male … female.2. Male … female … male … female.3. Male … female … male.4. Male … female … female.5. Male (\"true male\") … male … female.6. Male (\"true male\") … male.7. Female (exceptional) … male … female.Because the population consists of a vastly greater number of individuals of the younger ages than of the older age groups, it is obvious that death by suffocation, starvation, parasitization or some other cause will usually terminate the individual's existence before the normal cycle is completed.Protandric bisexuality is generally characteristic of the early sexual phases, with a tendency toward alternating unisexuality in later life. Of the latter, the female phase is usually of longer duration than the alternate male phase.The proportion of individuals in each sexual phase in the general population or in selected groups will obviously be correlated with a combination of the conditions mentioned above, but limited by associated environmental influences. The total population of teredos. living in a particular block of wood may thus consist of upwards of 90 per cent of individuals in either functional sexual phase or of about equal percentages of each, according to the age group or groups represented at the time of the examination.Attention has been previously (Coe, 1934a) called to the similarity of the sexual rhythm in Teredo to that of the larviparous oysters, \"although the usually shorter life of the former limits the number of the alternating sexual phases.\" There is some resemblance also to the sexual changes in the oviparous oysters (Coe, 1934b) and in the hard-shell clam Venus (Loosanoff, 1936), which are predominantly, but not exclusively, protandric, with a later change to the seasonally unisexual condition of the older individuals, in which there is an approximate equality in the sex ratio.",

      "title": "Reproductive Health Awareness of Tribal Adolescent Girls",
      "abstract": "Adolescence of age between 10-19 Years is in vital stage of growth and development. It is a period of transi- tion from childhood to adulthood and is marked by rapid physical, physiological and psychological changes. This period results in sexual, psychological and behavioral maturation. Adolescents are a diverse group and are in varying situations of risk, status and environments. For example, they could be married or unmarried, in-school or out-of-school, living in urban or rural areas or have a different sexual orientation. Some young people are especially vulnerable. We con- ducted a study in selected tribal dominated villages of Kurnool Districts. The objective of the study is to assess the knowl- edge, attitude and practices among the tribal adolescent girls towards their reproductive health. The major findings were physical change in early adolescent age and attractions towards enjoyment are the main focal points for adolescent. Due to this change the adolescent face physical attraction towards opposite sex. 1. Definition of reproductive health Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of repro- ductive disease or infirmity. Reproductive health deals with the reproductive processes, factions and system at all stages of life. Reproductive health is a crucial part of general health and a central feature of human development. It is a reflection of health during childhood, and crucial during adolescence and adulthood, sets the stage for health beyond the reproduc- tive years for both women and men, and affects the health of the next generation. The health of the newborn is largely a function of the mother's health and nutrition status and her access to health care. 1.2. Adolescent's girls of reproductive health About one-fifth of India's population is in the adolescent age group of 10-19 years. It is estimated that there are almost 200 million adolescents in India (ages 15-24). It is expected that this age group will continue to grow reaching over 214 million by 2020. Adolescence (10-19 Years) is a vital stage of growth and development. It is a period of transition from childhood to adulthood and is marked by rapid physical, physiological and psychological changes. Misconceptions about issues related to sex and sexuality, especially those related to masturbation, nocturnal emissions and menstruation make them anxious. Their anxiety and confusion is further compounded by adults who expect them to conduct themselves in a more mature manner without preparing them for their new role. Adoles- cents, and more so girls, have extra-nutritional requirements that are often ignored, leading to a number of health haz- ards. This has been a major cause of widely prevalent anae- mia among women. Further, girls are forced into early mar- riage that seriously undermines their health and limits their opportunities for personal development. Unwanted preg- nancies, risky abortions, haemorrhage, obstructed deliveries, low birth weight of the baby, and anaemia are some of the health risks attached to early marriage of girls. Additionally, restricted mobility of girls often limits their access to health services and information on reproductive health. Insensitive attitudes of healthcare providers also prevent them from ac- cessing services. In most cases, they hesitate to seek medical help for treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). 1.3. Unwanted pregnancies and abortions",

Developmentally normal children possess an inherent biological drive for sucking, the explanation for which can be found in both psychoanalytic and learning theory. Psychoanalytic theory contends that non-nutritive sucking represents a biological drive resulting from pleasurable stimulation of the lips and mouth; learning theory proposes that the infant learns to associate sucking with pleasurable feelings such as satiety or being held. Whatever the theoretical basis, thumbsucking generally is viewed as a biological drive that develops into a habit, which in the majority of cases resolves by age 4 years, but can persist much longer.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Being a lesbian, gay or bisexual youth means having the stigma of homosexuality or bisexuality. A stigma is anything that discredits an individual and leads to one being assigned a \"spoiled identity.\" With reference to lesbian, gay and bisexual youth, the stigma is considered a blemish on one's character that often leads to stereotyping and stigmatisation. This homophobia puts many lesbian, gay and bisexual youth at risk for suicide, chemical abuse, dropping out of school, verbal and physical abuse, homelessness, prostitution, HIV infection, and psychosocial developmental delays. Approaches and strategies for working with lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are suggested and trends and issues about homosexuality in the United States, with a potential impact on lesbian, gay and bisexual youth, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson's disease ( PD ) presents as an illness which predominantly affects older men. However older men's lived experiences of PD , including how they are influenced by age and gender relations has seen little empirical study. Drawing on Watson's male body schema, this paper explores how men engage with masculinities and ageing in order to make sense and meaning from PD . Data is presented from 30 narrative and semi structured interviews with 15 men of various ages who were living with PD . Findings suggest that PD threatens a visceral embodiment located in the body's basic movements and intimate functions; a pragmatic embodiment expressed through men's everyday occupations and an experiential embodiment concerned with emotions and sensations felt within and through the body. In addition, each dimension of men's embodiment also intersected with the ageing process, a process also shaped in turn by broader social and cultural concerns regarding the positions and possibilities of men's lives as they move through the life course. This paper concludes by discussing the implications of gender and ageing in understanding men's experiences of PD",

      "abstract": "In Freud's theory of the origins of femininity in females, there is a stage unaccounted for in the chronology of the little girl's development: the first many months of life are not considered. We know by now that castration anxiety, penis envy, and the traumas and frustrations of oedipal conflict are easy to demonstrate; but if the first stage in female development is different from Freud's description-if a fundamental, fixed sense of being rightfully a female is established in earliest childhood-then our psychology of women needs repair. The factors that make up this stage, with examples, are reviewed: (1) a biological \"force\": the effect of circulating fetal sex hormones on the brain of the fetus; (2) sex assignment: the announcement at the time of birth to the parents that they have had a boy or a girl (or a hermaphrodite); (3) parental attitudes: the effects of the sex assignment on parents, then reflected back onto the infant; (4) \"biopsychic\" phenomena: early postnatal effects caused by certain habitual patterns of handling the infant-conditioning, imprinting(?), or other forms of nonconflictual learning; (5) developing body ego: sensations, especially from the genitals, that define the child's dimensions. I suggest that one can divide the development of femininity in females into two phases, both of which lead to adult femininity, but each of which contributes in a different manner. The first, nonconflictual in origin, contributes a sense of femaleness and some of what allows for one's looking feminine; the second, the result of conflict, especially oedipal, produces a richer and more complicated femininity, not merely one of appearances, but one enriched by desires to perform with the substance, rather than just the façade, of femininity.",

      "title": "Sexual dysfunctions induced by stress of timed intercourse and medical treatment",
      "abstract": "Is premature ejaculation (PE) during vaginal intercourse really a male sexual dysfunction? Byun et al. 1 wrote ‘In men PE is more common than delayed ejaculation. Timed intercourse imposes a substantial degree of stress on men’. PE is a male sexual dysfunction characterised by ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within ≈1 min of vaginal penetration, and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and negative personal consequences 2. Sexual medicine experts consider PE only in the case of vaginal intercourse. PE is limited to heterosexual men engaging in vaginal intercourse, as there are few studies available on PE research in homosexual men or during other forms of sexual activity 2. Today PE is considered the cause of the failure to vaginal orgasm in the partner, with negative psychological consequences in males. Byun et al. 1 wrote ‘The impact of impending timed intercourse on sexual dysfunction and the behaviour of male partners has only recently been investigated’. Until a few decades ago during vaginal intercourse PE did not involve discomfort in males because orgasm was not essential for female sexual satisfaction: ‘Until the mid-twentieth century, many people (including some medical authorities) believed that women were not capable of orgasm. This belief undoubtedly reflected a cultural bias: sex was seen as something the man did to the woman for his own gratification. Women were told for centuries to do their wifely duties by making themselves available to their husbands for sex’ 3. As a matter of fact the vaginal orgasm does not have any scientific basis and is a theory that was invented by Freud in 1905. The vagina does not have an anatomical structure that can cause an orgasm; a minority of women says they experience vaginal orgasm because this is the term that is explained to them by sexologists. The ‘vaginal orgasm’ that some women report is caused by the surrounding erectile organs, i.e. clitoris, vestibular bulbs and pars intermedia, labia minora, corpus spongiosum of female urethra. Distinguishing between clitoral and vaginal orgasm is not correct from a physiological view point 3, 4. The vaginal orgasm and G-spot do not exist 3-5, therefore the duration of penile–vaginal intercourse is not important for a woman's orgasm. Even today there exists only one model of physical relations: foreplay, penetration, intercourse, and ejaculation. Many men think long intercourse is the key to having orgasm during intercourse, but long intercourse is not helpful to most women. As male ejaculation does not automatically mean the end of sex for most women, touching and kissing can be continued almost indefinitely. Men think of the preliminaries as an unnecessary delay, and sexologists describe non-coital sexual activity (i.e. partner masturbation and oral sex) by the term ‘foreplay’, which implies that these acts are preliminary to intercourse, making intercourse the main event, but some people prefer other forms of sexual activity instead of coitus. Intercourse must not be the focal point of sex, ‘foreplay’ is misleading term and it must be discarded 3. Physiologically female sexual satisfaction is based on orgasm and resolution. Women with effective sexual stimulation have the physical capability of being orgasmic at all ages: clitoral stimulation is important for achieving the orgasm 3, 4. Byun et al. 1 wrote ‘Physicians and clinicians should acknowledge the potentially harmful effects of timed intercourse on the physical and mental health of men’. Physicians and clinicians must acknowledge that PE is normal and it is common for any healthy adolescent man. It is important for teenagers to understand that PE is absolutely normal at this age. PE is really normal in adolescent males, especially during their first sexual encounters 3. Men with PE have no negative personal consequences during masturbation: as a matter of fact PE does not exist when the orgasm and ejaculation are obtained by masturbation. By masturbation adolescent will understand their responses and men will be able to gain better control also during intercourse. Masturbation provides a safe means of sexual experimentation, improving sexual self-confidence. In the ‘stop-start’ method the male stimulates the penis manually until him feels that he is rapidly approaching ejaculation, at which time he stops all stimulation until the sense of ejaculatory urgency disappears. Stimulation then begins again, and the stop-start cycle is repeated several times before the man is allowed to ejaculate. In the ‘squeeze’ technique the man puts his first and second fingers on the frenulum of the penis and places his thumb just below the coronal ridge on the opposite side of the penis. A firm pressure is applied for about four seconds and then abruptly released. The ‘squeeze’ technique reduces the urgency to ejaculate. It must begin at the early stages of masturbation and continue periodically, every few minutes. In the basilar squeeze the squeezing is at the base of the penis 3. PE has become the centre of a multimillion dollar business: PE during vaginal intercourse is not a male sexual dysfunction. ‘PE does not exist if both partners agree that the quality of their sexual encounters is not influenced by efforts to delay ejaculation’ and ‘Some females may be grateful to get it over with quickly’. 3. Physicians and clinicians must acknowledge two specific methods called the ‘stop-start’ method and the ‘squeeze’ technique that helps recondition the ejaculatory reflex during masturbation. Non-coital sexual acts after male ejaculation can be used to produce orgasm in women. Physicians, clinicians, urologists, gynaecologists, sexologists, and sexual medicine experts should define having sex/making love, as the situation in which orgasm happens in both partners with or without vaginal intercourse: a definition for all human beings 4, 6. Sexual dysfunctions are conditions in which the ordinary physical responses of sexual function are impaired. The study of the functions of the human body must be made in the subject: questionnaires for male ejaculation and female orgasm must too assess masturbation 7.",

      "title": "Contextual Information Shifts Young Children’s Understanding of Gender Constancy",
      "abstract": "Children's understanding of the stability of gender over time has long been recognized as a hallmark of early childhood cognitive development. Prior research has argued that until roughly age 6, children do not understand that a person’s gender identity remains consistent if the person undergoes a change in gendered behavior or appearance. However, this prior work has generally not given children any context as to why the behavior or appearance change is occurring. The present study showed 3-to-5-year-olds a character (e.g., “Johnny”) undergo such a change that occurred because of external factors (e.g., “Johnny is wearing his sister’s dress because all his clothes are dirty”); we asked whether children would indicate that the character’s gender was the same pre- and post-change. Children (N = 124, 52% girls, 66% non-Hispanic White) as young as 3 demonstrated understanding of gender consistency and were significantly more likely to endorse gender consistency when they were, versus were not, given context for the change (p &amp;lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.88). Results suggest that children take context into account when conceptualizing others’ genders and believe that gender is generally consistent across transformations in behavior or appearance by age 3. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of a broader literature about children’s understanding of gender constancy as well as contemporary understandings of gender that sometimes accommodate the idea that a person’s gender can change.",

      "abstract": "1 Sex differentiates under genetic control during successive periods. Classical morphological and experimental data have shown the sexual bipotentiality of the developing structures. But, as a matter of fact, several observations indicate that both sexes are not equal or equipotential as to their developmental trends and mechanisms. 2 The developmental analysis of the body sex characteristics reveals a hormonal control. In animal experiments made by the author and by others it has been observed that many structures or systems develop along the feminine type in the absence of testes during several critical developmental stages. These structures include the genital tract, the hypothalamic centres controlling the pituitary function, the nervous structures mediating sex behaviour and possibly other tissues. The ovary is unnecessary for the feminine differentiation of these structures; in males, femaleness has to be repressed and maleness imposed by the testes. 3 The problem of gonadal sex differentiation is re-evaluated; developmental aspects occurring during normal development or in the gonads of freemartins in cattle are examined. During early sexual differentiation of the gonads, testes rapidly differentiate whereas ovaries are first characterized mainly by the fact that they do not become testes. These observations can be interpreted by assuming that in males a signal imposes masculinity on the gonadal primordia which otherwise would slowly become ovaries. 4 It is hypothesized that throughout sexual differentiation in mammals, maleness has to be actively imposed on a system which will become feminine if it escapes this control.",

The main results, which are cross validated across the two samples, are as follows.Most men score high on all five indicators of social support. Social relationship conflicts are either nonspecific or related to the steady partner. Isolation and lack of positive appraisal are also nonspecific or related to gay friends. Parents still function as important sources of material support. Men without a steady partner and men with low socioeconomic status experience more isolation. Single men also report less positive appraisal, while older men have less material support.",

Although the phrase language deprivation syndrome may be new, the observation, that deficits observed in some deaf people's life skills might be due not to sensory deprivation or to social impoverishment, but specifically to deprivation, is not. Language deprivation is often the unintended outcome of well-intentioned efforts to promote a child's development. The existence of deprivation is a corollary to the existence of a critical period for learning one's first language. The most severe cases of deprivation therefore follow a child's not being exposed to consistent and fully elaborated during the entire critical period, approximately the first five years of life. Language deprivation persists in large part because it crosses the boundaries of multiple professional disciplines, none of which is solely responsible for a child's outcome.",

Additionally, many doctors are uncomfortable with the patient's questions about sexuality and feel uneasy about broaching the subject themselves. In some cases, they feel that such questions are an intrusion on the patient's privacy, even though they realize that bowel and drug habits, cigarette and alcohol use and reproductive status are also private matters. In other cases, they believe that the patient's sexual concerns are not of medical significance or that their own ability to treat such concerns is limited.

In consequence, a drug-like utilization of sexuality becomes necessary to suspend feelings of violence as well as to anaesthetize, if only temporarily, a castrated image of the self, a threatened loss of ego boundaries, or feelings of inner deadness. The primary homosexual wishes of all children, in their dual version—the wish to possess the same-sex parent and the wish to be the opposite-sex parent—also demands solutions in the sexuality of the adult-to-be. The early mother–child relationship may be a decisive factor in laying the foundations for deviant sexual patterns. Neosexualities is not a concept but rather a certain way of listening to the analysands as they describe and explore their sexual lives.",

      "abstract": "Data provided by 24 adult men, 20 heterosexual and four homosexual, concerning parental, religious, geographic and explicit sexual innuendos, comments and childhood experiences are presented and discussed in an attempt to consider some of the multiple factors impacting the development of sexual orientation. All of the study subjects were normally developed males and were presumed to have been exposed to normal male levels of androgens prenatally. Since the experiences and perceptions reported are conditioned by a unique social environment that has been superimposed on a normal male typical prenatal CNS differentiation, the experiences of these men suggest that affirmation of masculinity, and openness in the realm of social and sexual interaction, may enhance the formation of a heterosexual orientation. Conversely, sexually explicit feedback with critical implications occurred commonly among the homosexual men, which they interpreted as implying an insufficient masculinity. Both innate factors and social influences impact sexual orientation; in some instances males appear to have been homosexual from early childhood onward, while in other cases there appears to have been some degree of conditioning and choice in sexual orientation. Regarding the intersexed male, this suggests that social interactions, particularly those provided by parents, have a major influence on the development of sexual orientation in the child, while all persons involved in these children's lives and particularly those who nurture must be prepared for any sexual orientation that develops.",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "This exploration of adolescent pregnancy focuses on adolescents whose pregnancies are undesired. The physical and psychic transformations of puberty and adolescence may be experienced differently in different social contexts. The prolongation of school attendance in Western societies means that most adolescents remain financially dependent on their parents. But greater sexual freedom in the society at large has been reflected in an increase in early sexual activity among adolescents. Wider use of contraception has not completely eliminated prenatal pregnancy among adolescents. Adolescent pregnancies have actually declined in France as a proportion of all pregnancies carried to term, from 4% to 1.5-2% in the past 10 or 15 years. But in 1986, 42.5% of all induced abortions were performed on adolescents. Among causes of unwanted pregnancy in adolescents are their frequent inability to believe that they may be at risk of pregnancy, or that pregnancy can result from the 1st sexual intercourse. The episodic nature of sexual relations, the lack of ready availability of contraception, and specific shortcomings of different methods are factors in the frequent failure of adolescents to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Adolescents may become pregnant out of loneliness or to prove that they are women, or as a result of incest or prostitution. Adolescents who seek abortions are those who have discovered and acknowledged their pregnancies before the 12th week and had the courage to inform their parents and obtain legal permission for the abortion. Pregnancy terminations are more frequent in more advantaged societal sectors with more structured family life. The moral shock and sense of failure associated with abortion are often deeply felt by adolescents. Their experience is greatly influenced by the attitudes of those around them. Adolescents who carry their pregnancies to term are those who have not sought abortion in the 1st 12 weeks. Often they refuse to admit they might be pregnant. But adolescents from disadvantaged environments may wish to continue the pregnancy in order to attain social status. Most parents eventually resign themselves to the pregnancy. Adolescents who are closely monitored usually have normal pregnancies and deliveries. The proportion of adolescent mothers who place their infants for adoption has declined. Most of the infants kept by their mothers are entitled to 2 sets of social prestations, the allowances for the young infant and for single parents. School nurses have an important potential contribution in informing students about sexuality and contraception and in assisting those who become pregnant.",

      "abstract": "Subjective age (how old or young individuals feel relative to their chronological age) is gaining popularity in gerontology and related disciplines because of its relation with biopsychosocial processes of aging. Evidence from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and other cohorts is reviewed on the predictors and outcomes of subjective age. An older subjective age is predicted by age discrimination, negative changes in one’s social and family networks, lower well-being and perceived control, poor physical conditions and more chronic health problems. Subjective age is also predictive of a range of crucial outcomes. Indeed, feeling younger is related to better physical and mental health, cognition, more favorable personality changes, lower risk of incident hospitalization, and longevity. These findings suggest that the subjective experience of age is a biopsychosocial marker of aging with promise as a predictor of crucial age-related outcomes, beyond chronological age.",

      "abstract": "Sexual consent refers to people's internal willingness to engage in sexual activity with another person-as well as their external communication of that willingness. Internal and external sexual consent can vary by type of sexual behavior; however, previous research on sexual consent has primarily only assessed \"typical\" sexual behaviors such as genital touching, oral sex, and vaginal-penile sex without providing further context or acknowledging people's sexual diversity. Therefore, we provided an initial account of people's sexual consent-and lack thereof-for a broader array of sexual behaviors and contexts in which they occur. Using an online cross-sectional survey of participants in the United Kingdom and the United States (N = 658, 50.5% women), we examined event-level internal and external sexual consent for 20 sexual behaviors or contexts. Women reported significantly lower levels of sexual consent feelings than men for 12 of the 20 sexual behaviors and lower levels of active consent communication for 7 of them. Almost a third of participants (31.0%) had experienced at least one of the listed sexual behaviors against their will. Of those, participants on average reported nonconsensual experiences with 3.1 of the 20 types of sexual behavior listed, ranging from 1 to 11. More women reported at least one nonconsensual experience with one of the sexual behaviors assessed compared with men (47.9% versus 22.3%, respectively). We discussed several behavior-specific findings regarding sexual consent and the lack thereof. We also made recommendations for initiatives aimed at promoting healthy sexual consent practices: embrace sexual diversity, emphasize sexual agency, and encourage active consent communication.",

      "abstract": "Life span is a continuum of development and growth at one end and deterioration of functions or senescence or aging at the other end. In between is the reproductive phase or adulthood. Life span can be defined as the duration of life of an individual or organism in a particular environment. The life span of a multicellular organism may be broadly divided into three phases: development (growth), reproductive period (adulthood) and senescence (aging). The time of onset, duration and rate of each phase is dependent on the vigour and vitality of the other, and are therefore interrelated. Development normally involves both quantitative and qualitative changes leading to suitable specialization of various cells, tissues and organs of the body, which is usually referred to as differentiation. The development of many animals is divided into prenatal and postnatal periods. For many years, attention was focused on events taking place before birth, when the most striking advances occur in the animals. Prenatal and postnatal stages are characterized by certain distinguishing features, such as morphologic, physiologic, biochemical and psychological features.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Previous research on semifree‐ranging mandrills has shown that the degree of secondary sexual development differs among adult males. While some males are social, brightly colored, and have large testes and high levels of plasma testosterone, other males are peripheral or solitary, and lack fully developed secondary sexual features. In order to determine how these differences among males arise, and to investigate the influence of social factors, we examined the adolescent development of 13 semifree‐ranging male mandrills of known age. Testicular volume began to increase markedly at 5.5 yr, and males began to develop secondary sexual adornments at the age of 6 yr. Males attained adult size and secondary sexual development at an average age of 9 yr. As males developed, they peripheralized, decreasing from 100% group‐associated at 5 yr to 20% at 8 yr. At 9 yr some males reentered the social group and attained alpha rank, while others remained peripheral or solitary. Within this average development, there was marked variation among males in the timing of development. Adolescent males that were dominant for their age had higher testosterone levels, larger testes, and more advanced secondary sexual development than subordinate males. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of differences that occur among adult males, male–male competition, and the evolution of secondary sexual adornments in this species. Am.

Functional outcomes depend on a complex interplay of physiological, developmental and environmental factors. We start with the premise that hearing loss by itself will often have an impact on cognitive organization but not necessarily or consistently on intellectual, neuropsychological, emotional, social or behavioral functioning. Disruption of these functions depends heavily on other factors that may be associated with etiology of the hearing loss or the interaction between individuals and their environment, including communication, family, educational, emotional and sociolinguistic environments. At the same time, effects related to a hearing loss can have significant negative impact in each of these areas, particularly without comprehensive and appropriate supports.",

In contrast, a “contemporary” form of rapid-onset sexual addiction has emerged with the explosive growth of Internet technology and is distinguished by “3Cs”: chronicity, content, and culture. Of particular concern is early exposure to graphic sexual material that disrupts normal neurochemical, sexual, and social development in youth. Treatment modalities for “classic” and “contemporary” forms are overlapping yet distinct, reflecting their unique etiologies and similar presentations.",

There is robust research and information regarding its biological aspects specially its endocrine base, yet the psychosocial aspect is quite interesting and debatable due to its variability among different cultures and climates. There are certain subthreshold response in form fear and loss of reproductive life to no more ability to reproduce and a feeling of loss of femininity. The period of menstruation simulated to reproductive age or fertility is around half of their lives; therefore, loss of fertility or reproductive life may be a source of stress specially among tribes where long reproductive age period is desired on the cultural belief that this will lead to a large family size that is considered as a symbol of success. Psychological factors such personal or inter-psychic (personality, self-esteem, and coping skills) and intra-psychic (relationship issues and social support) may contribute in the onset, course, and repose to perimenopausal period. There are certain psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome related to premenopausal period that must be screened. Before embarking on pharmacological treatment, psychosocial intervention especially lifestyle modifications must be offered to avoid complications.",

This paper presents two cases, whose heterosexual preference were changed in late adolescent age after a severe psychological event, to draw attention to the study of the possible underlying mechanism. Case 1, one identical male twin, was seriously punished at age 12 years, as he loved a girl in his classroom. Afterwards, he feared to contact with girls, and became attracted to young men at age 17 years, and kept same-sex sexual behaviors since then. However, his twin brother is always heterosexual. Case 2, a girl at age 16 years, was unexpectedly betrayed by her boyfriend, she bore great pain and distress in the beginning. Since then, she had a definite opinion that men were unbelievable, and gradually turned her heterosexual preference and had same-sex sexual behaviors with a girl classmate more than 3 years. Our case presentation indicates that severe frustration of primary heterosexual desires or behaviors and the successive cognitive regulation might lead susceptible adolescents into reorienting their sexual preference. The role of prefrontal cortex and related neuromodulatory pathways were discussed.",

These latter organs of infinitely diversified kinds graduate into, and in some cases can hardly be distinguished from, those which are commonly ranked as primary, such as the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects. Unless indeed we confine the term “primary” to the reproductive glands, it is scarcely possible to decide, as far as the organs of prehension are concerned, which ought to be called primary and which secondary.",

In dit proefschrift worden de effecten onderzocht van blootstelling aan merken die een hoge status of hoge aantrekkelijkheid uitstralen op de zelfperceptie en gedrag. Dit onderzoek is verricht vanuit een evolutionair perspectief. De centrale hypothese is dat mannen worden meer beinvloed worden door merken die een hoge status en een hoge competentie uitstralen. Vrouwen worden verwacht meer beinvloed te worden door merken die een hoge fysieke aantrekkelijkheid en een sterke verfijning uitstralen. De resultaten laten zien dat mannen die status consumptie belangrijk vinden, hun status lager waarderen na blootstelling aan een foto van een hoge status auto. Mannen rapporteren ook een lagere assertieve gedragsintentie, en laten lager status gedrag zien na blootstelling aan een man die een hoge merkcompetentie uitstraalt. Mannen blijven echter in dit geval wel een hogere sociale dominantie te rapporteren, terwijl ze dat niet laten zien. Vrouwen waarderen de eigen aantrekkelijk hoger na blootstelling aan foto´s die een hoge fysieke aantrekkelijkheid uitstralen, zeker wanneer zij het belangrijk vinden hun fysieke uiterlijk te vergelijken. Daarnaast rapporteren vrouwen een hogere assertieve gedragsintentie en laten zij meer hoge status gedrag zien na blootstelling aan een vrouw die hoge merkverfijning uitstraalt. De conclusie van dit proefschrift dan mannen zich in het algemeen meer laten intimideren door merken met een hoge status, terwijl vrouwen merken geassocieerd met een hoge aantrekkelijkheid zien als een bron van inspiratie.",

      "abstract": "Definitions of domestic violence vary according to the frequency, severity and nature of the violence as well as the context in which it occurred and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator. Though there is a lack of uniformity, a generally accepted definition of domestic violence is the physical, sexual or emotional abuse of an adult woman by a man with whom she has or has had an intimate relationship, regardless of whether the couple are living together. Although violence can be carried out by other family members or occur in same-sex relationships, it is argued that men use violence in order to maintain dominance and control over their female partners. Physical violence is just one of the many tactics that an abuser may use to exert control over his partner. Other behaviours include isolation, intimidation, threats of violence, threats to take the children away or hurt them and emotional or economic abuse. Whilst some studies have identified demographic patterns associated with domestic violence, it can affect any woman regardless of age, race, ethnicity, social class, employment status, religion, marital status or disability.",

      "title": "Excerpts from “Doing Gender”",
      "abstract": "This chapter aims to propose an ethnomethodologically informed, and therefore distinctively sociological, understanding of gender as a routine, methodical, and recurring accomplishment. Analyses of sex and gender in the social sciences, though less likely to accept uncritically the naive biological determinism of the view just presented, often retain a conception of sex-linked behaviors and traits as essential properties of individuals. Gender may be routinely fashioned in a variety of situations that seem conventionally expressive to begin with, such as those that present “helpless” women next to heavy objects or flat tires. Many situations are not clearly sex categorized to begin with, nor is what transpires within them obviously gender relevant. Subsequently, little boys appropriate the gender ideal of “efficaciousness,” that is, being able to affect the physical and social environment through the exercise of physical strength or appropriate skills. Thus gender differences, or the sociocultural shaping of “essential female arid male natures,” achieve the status of objective facts.",

Here we use cross-cultural approach to find out whether some traits could be labelled as highly prevalent or nearly universal. We further employed comparative perspective to analyze whether these traits are unique in humans or whether they are shared with our evolutionary relatives. This led us to formulate eight broad spheres which are reported cross-culturally. These include 1) building long-term sexual relationships and expected or enforced sexual exclusivity; 2) sexual activities not restricted to fertile period and 3) prevalent through the year which suggest other than reproductive functions of the sex in humans; 4) in contrast to chimpanzees attractiveness is relatively stable across the cycle; 5) humans appear to be the only species with exclusive male homosexual orientation; 6) similarly, presence of menopause is unique to human females, which was linked to relatively risky delivery and extreme altriciality of human children; and finally, 7) humans do not commonly perform sexual activities in the presence of others. All of the addressed phenomena are interpreted in the evolutionary perspective.",

Problems of sexual arousal in women are now recognized to mirror erectile dysfunction in men in many ways and assessment of cardiovascular disease should form part of the routine assessment of women presenting with sexual problems of lack of vaginal arousal (including lubrication) or clitoral arousal. However, psychosocial issues can predominate and perpetuate sexual problems for women and often require concurrent assessment. The sexual difficulties may be concurrent to erectile dysfunction or another sexual problem in the man. An offer of multiple interventions should be recommended where indicated.",

The most frequent cause of this is premature ejaculation in the male. Only the selfishness of the male, and of physicians who are generally males, has made it possible to overlook the fact that such a state of affairs, if it becomes stabilized, must lead at least to functional disturbances. The female sex, which has subjected itself to the male viewpoint in morals as in other matters, has so completely adopted this ideal of femininity that it holds the opposite attitude to be impossible for itself, even in thought. The female sex provides a great contrast to this. All sexual excitement is methodically kept away from girls but also in fantasy.",

Solitude is not invariably accompanied by loneliness. In the past decade, research on loneliness has expanded rapidly, spurred in part by the development of reliable paper-and-pencil instruments to assess loneliness. Like other forms of psychological distress, loneliness is more common among lower socioeconomic groups. Loneliness is most common among adolescents and young adults, and is less often reported by people in older age groups. The immediate cause of loneliness is typically some event that produces a significant deficit in a person's social relations.",

The references to these cases have appeared over a period of many centuries. A detailed examination of the accounts led me to the conclusion they were of little value for any scientific purpose. Yet these cases are frequently cited to show that children reared by animals adopt animal traits and, more generally, that early childhood influences are relatively permanent in their consequences. In general, it cannot be questioned that the alleged wild children have been unsocialized when captured and few of them have exhibited much improvement even after several years in society. Most of them have many traits in common with imbeciles and idiots as well as traits of infrahuman animals. It was my interpretation that instead of these individuals once having been normal and then having become permanently altered by association with animals, it seems more likely that most of them were originally mentally defective and remained mentally defective whether with animals or with men. Reasons for this interpretation were presented in some detail in my earlier",

      "title": "Foundations of Sex, Love and Relationships: From Conception to Birth*",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The nine-month period from conception to birth, previously hidden and mysterious, is increasingly illuminated by the technology of science. Signs of intelligent behavior early in gestation cast new light on traditional ideas about the brain, learning, memory, self, and the primal origins of relationships. In the womb, relationships are everything; mother and child are progressively linked by physical senses, the aura of emotion, and their mutual perceptions of outside events. Their relationship is carried forward to birth, when babies learn much more about people and life. Machine age birth with its painful routines, intrusive manipulation, chemical agents, and nurseries teaches powerful lessons which can have lasting impact. The faculty of unconscious memory, increasingly breached and probed in psychotherapy, is particularly revealing of the primal foundations of sex, love, and relationships. INTRODUCTION The foundations of sex, love, and relationships are under construction before birth, a period once veiled in darkness but now accessible to science through many windows of observation. Discoveries made in the last twenty years have given us a new encyclopedia of knowledge about the unborn and newborn; most of our previous beliefs about them have been proven false.1-3 Intrauterine photography has taken us down the Fallopian tube to watch with amazement the union of sperm and egg.4 With real time ultrasound we can eavesdrop on the fetus at any time and see what is going on. The science of embryology has charted the development of all parts of the body by the week and the day; you can see it all displayed in a full color atlas.5 Extensive studies of the sense of touch, equilibrium, taste, hearing, smell, and sight tell us when senses are present and working. As neuroscience leaps forward, much of what we thought we knew about the infant brain turns out to be misleading. An array of psychological studies of learning, perception, and memory both before and after birth make it appropriate to use the term cognitive newborn for the first time.6 As a psychologist (and grandparent) I am particularly interested in the foundations of mind and personality and what parents and doctors are doing to help or hinder development. In my book Babies Remember Birth, I focused public attention on the validity of birth memories and the unexpected maturity of thought they contain.7 I do not repeat those arguments here. According modern research, the newborn is a competent learner, engaging personality, and gifted communicator. These surprising abilities do not spring suddenly to life like a Jack-in-the-Box at birth. They begin in the womb. Here we can look for the beginnings of sex, love, and relationships, a prime interest in prenatal and perinatal psychology, as it is in sex therapy, sex education, and marriage counseling. SIGNS OF INTELLIGENCE BEFORE BIRTH My first task is to note briefly some of the evidence for intelligent behavior before birth, intelligence being the kind of mental self-management used in adapting to conditions, selecting among conditions, and purposefully shaping new conditions.8 Being able to benefit from experience is another important feature of intelligence, and implies learning and memory. I begin here because without this it is difficult to appreciate how experiences in the womb can matter. Intelligence before birth was not supposed to be possible. Old views of the brain held that the first parts of the brain to develop were primitive and not capable of complex activity; they were thought to depend on higher structures which would not be developed until after birth. Learning and memory before birth were not anticipated, hence experiences in the womb and at birth could not be educational. Without a properly functioning brain, there could be no real person. If there were no person, there would be no immediate need for parenting, no psyche, no need for a prenatal psychology or even a birth psychology. …",

      "title": "Topical Review: Fetal Testosterone and Sex Differences in Typical Social Development and in Autism",
      "abstract": "Experiments in animals leave no doubt that androgens, including testosterone, produced by the testes in fetal and/or neonatal life act on the brain to induce sex differences in neural structure and function. In human beings, there is evidence supporting a female superiority in the ability to read nonverbal signals, specific language-related skills, and theory of mind. Even more striking than the sex differences seen in the typical population is the elevated occurrence of social and communicative difficulties in human males. One such condition, autism, occurs four times more frequently in boys than in girls. Recently, a novel theory known as the ``extreme male brain'' has been proposed. It suggests that the behaviors seen in autism are an exaggeration of typical sex differences and that exposure to high levels of prenatal testosterone might be a risk factor. In this article, we argue that prenatal and neonatal testosterone exposures are strong candidates for having a causal role in sexual dimorphism in human behavior, including social development, and as risk factors for conditions characterized by social impairments, particularly autism spectrum conditions.

      "title": "Environmental effects on reproductive health: the endocrine disruption hypothesis.",
      "abstract": "R eproductive health is exquisitely sensitive to characteristics of an individual's environment-including physical, biological, behavioral, cultural and socioeconomic factors. The relative effects of these features may vary in different parts of the world or even within a country. For example, in populations with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases or in areas with inadequate health care resources, untreated infections may pose the greatest threats, increasing women's risk of experiencing premature delivery, fetal loss or prenatal mortality. Furthermore, the infants of women with such diseases risk acquiring the infection during delivery and are vulnerable to other complications during the neonatal period.' In societies where cultural norms favor large families, women may suffer health problems resulting from frequent childbearing. Similarly, malnutrition increases a pregnant woman's susceptibility to poor outcomes. In some regions, workplace and industrial pollution, as well as substances that are used commercially or in the home, may pose the greatest threats. Exposure to lead, for instance, is associated with fertility impairments in both women and men, as well as with the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth; exposure to mercury in certain forms may cause birth defects and neurological disorders. A rnumber of solvents contribute to the risk of spontaneous abortion and birth defects, and some of these substances may be a factor in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and male infertility. Epidemiological studies have proven the adverse reproductive health effects of some pesticides, and mounting evidence suggests that other of these products also are harmful to reproductive health.2 Both man-made and naturally occurring materials that appear to interfere with hormone synthesis or action are among substances whose effects on reproductive health are strongly suggested, if not clearly established. Recent research pointing to the possible role of so-called endocrine disrupters in a variety of reproductive health problems in wildlife, laboratory animals and humans has engendered considerable controversy in scientific circles. Some scientists question the valhdity of the findings on a variety of grounds, while others have used them to outline agendas for further research and relevant policymaking. As the endocrine disruption debate continues to occupy researchers, it also is gaining attention among the public. During the past several years, articles and opinion pieces about reproductive health problems and endocrine disruption have appeared in newspapers and in popular science, business, news and general interest magazines.3 Public interest groups have produced monographs reviewing the subject,4 and the trade publications of industries whose products have been labeled endocrine disrupters have carried articles and editorials seeking a balanced reading of the evidence.5 A new round of coverage followed the publication in early 1996 of Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival?-A Scientific Detective Story.6 The book, written for lay readers, chronicles the development of the endocrine disruption hypothesis and considers its implications. Much of the popular coverage of the issue has reflected great attention to presenting both sides of the question in a manner that will inform but not alarm the public. Some of it, however, has been less successful at establishing a context for the findings, clearly distinguishing facts from hypotheses, and communicating a measured view of the implications both of what has been demonstrated and of areas requiring extensive additional research. The public has a right and a need to know about issues with a potential for substantial public health ramifications; sensible voices on both sides of this debate acknowledge the need for additional research and risk assessment, clear priorities for dealing with documented risks and dissemination of verifiable information that can help individuals make informed health decisions. The endocrine disruption hypothesis promises to remain a focus of researchand debate-for some time to come. Therefore, without minimizing the importance of other environmental risk factors for men's and women's reproductive health, this report focuses on what is known about hormone disrupters, areas that are being explored and the potential implications for public health and policy.",

This makes the differential diagnosis of psychopathological conditions and their valid prognostic evaluation very difficult indeed. Diagnoses, and especially valid predictions of possible future pathology, are even more difficult to make in the area of the teenager's sexual development. We have come to consider a wide range of adult sex activity as being within the extent of the normal; for the adolescent we must widen this concept even more because he is still unstable and insecure, and may experiment in order to find out what he really likes and wants.

      "title": "Psychosexual problems.",
      "abstract": "Individual anxieties about sexuality remain surprisingly repetitive despite changing public attitudes toward sexuality. This discussion includes case histories which demonstrate the indirect presentation, using nonverbal and physical cues, adopted by some patients who experience difficulty in verbalizing their sexual problems. When seeking contraceptive consultation, the patient must have no conscious or unconscious anxiety about her desire for sexual pleasure without pregnancy and is entitled to assume, when seeking such advice, that the doctor who offers it has no such prejudices either. When the presenting symptom relates to otherwise illogical contraceptive difficulty, or otherwise invites examination of the genitals, one may suspect that the problem may be sexual and too difficult to express in other than the physical language the patient expects the physician to want. For a couple whose sexual life is comfortably confident and provides pleasure, any contraceptive method will serve its purpose of removing the fear of pregnancy. Such a couple may be advised on logical grounds. For the rest, an open-ended comment such as \"I wonder what the real worry is\" usually leads to the true anxiety. Yet, at this point, the doctor's anxiety often replaces the patient's since the management of psychosomatic disorders is not part of normal medical training. The temptation to send for the partner and advise a program of relearning, or to make referral to a sex therapy clinic which will do likewise, is strong for any busy doctor who has no psychosexual training. Skill in dealing with such common dilemmas in the context of the brief period allotted to each patient cannot be obtained from a short article, but it is worthwhile for a physician, confronted with a patient whose symptoms do not make sense, to ask what the symptom itself may indicate in terms of the unspoken problem at hand. Most family doctors who understand the training of the Institute of Psychosexual Medicine find their brief psychosomatic approach more appropriate to their everyday work than time-consuming behavioral sex therapy and more appropriate to patients who present their problems in the surgery. Such patients usually are troubled with their individual vision of their personal sexuality. Those who have no inclination for such training will make more accurate diagnoses if they are aware that nonverbal clues may say more than words and that referral to a colleague trained in psychosexual medicine may be more fruitful than one which only reinforces the patient's sense of inadequacy and abnormality.",

      "abstract": "Sexual wellness is integral to quality of life across the life span, despite ageist stereotypes suggesting sexual expression ends at midlife. However, conceptualizing sexual wellness in mid- and later life is complicated by a dysfunction-based narrative, lack of a sex-positive aging framework, and existing measures that are age irrelevant and limited in scope. This study aimed to address these limitations by providing a conceptualization of sexual wellness grounded in definitions from midlife and older adults. A sample of 373 midlife and older adults (M = 60, SD = 5.84) in the United States provided a definition of sexual wellness. Using thematic analysis, multiple researchers coded qualitative responses, and results suggested a biopsychosocial-cultural framework. Findings reflect that midlife and older adults provide multifaceted definitions inclusive of various behavioral experiences, including disengaging from sex. They are also keenly aware of physical and psychological limitations and strengths, and emphasize mutual experiences and synchronicity. Midlife and older adults also reflect on age, drawing comparisons to different phases of life and often displaying adaptability in adjusting expectations. When conceptualizing sexual wellness in this population it is imperative to capture this multidimensionality, include those who are not actively engaging in sex, and be aware of the influence of ageist and dys/function narratives.",

Neben biologischen, psychologischen und partnerschaftlichen Ursachen für sexuelle Probleme ist insbesondere die pharmakologische Behandlung affektiver Störungen oft selbst Teil des Problems. Verschiedene medikamentöse und adjuvante Strategien können hier erfolgreich eingesetzt werden. Schlussfolgerung und klinische Relevanz Nicht immer lassen sich sexuelle Nebenwirkungen, sexuelle Störungen oder Partnerschaftskonflikte vollständig verhindern. Dennoch sind ein offener und ehrlicher Kommunikationsstil und eine gründliche Prüfung von möglichen Vorgehensweisen, um dieses zusätzliche Leiden depressiver Patienten zu lindern, möglich.

These changes have direct and indirect, conscious and unconscious effects on the woman's sexuality. The individual response to these effects—the integration and coping with the changes—may lead to a broadening and deepening of the individual's sexual life or it may lead to sexual problems, dysfunction, and difficulties. These sexual problems may then have a mid- and long-term negative impact on a woman's physical and mental health and on her relationships and family development. Empirical research seems to indicate that pregnancy and the time after childbirth are critical for the beginning or the exacerbation of preexisting sexual difficulties. In particular, the differences in sexual desire between the partners are critical. It is therefore important to combine antenatal and postnatal care with sexual health care. This includes screening, detection, and assessment of sexual problems during obstetrical consultations and sexual counseling for women and their partners.",

It creates one of the perennial problems in social welfare. It is at one and the same time demographic and social, biological and ideological. Illegitimacy is baffling, however, as well as intriguing, which may in a certain sense increase its appeal to the researcher.",

      "title": "Hikikomori, un concept pertinent pour penser le retrait des jeunes au domicile ?",
      "abstract": "Le terme japonais hikikomori désigne un adolescent ou un jeune adulte, le plus souvent de sexe masculin, passant la quasi-totalité de son temps à domicile et s’étant retiré de la vie sociale depuis au moins 6 mois. Ce comportement n’est pas expliqué par une incapacité physique ou une pathologie psychiatrique manifeste. Si le phénomène a initialement été décrit au Japon, des articles sur ce sujet paraissent dans la littérature américaine, anglaise et française. En gardant à l’esprit les particularités de la société nipponne, est-il possible de transposer ce concept à nos sociétés occidentales pour mieux comprendre le phénomène de réclusion de certains jeunes adultes au domicile ? Comme le montre Ehrenberg dans ses travaux, dans nos sociétés, la pression à la performance et à l’autonomisation est forte. Il peut devenir difficile de répondre à cette norme, d’autant plus quand l’environnement familial ne favorise pas le travail de séparation. On note également des différences cliniques selon les pays. Par exemple, les facteurs déclenchants, comme des difficultés sentimentales ou scolaires, sont fréquemment retrouvés en France contrairement au Japon. D’abord utilisé en pédopsychiatrie, dans la continuité du refus scolaire anxieux, il semble que le concept d’hikikomori soit également pertinent en psychiatrie adulte. La difficulté réside alors dans la détection de ces situations de souffrance, qui deviennent moins visibles lorsque le sujet sort du parcours scolaire.",

It has a debilitating effect on the development, speech, general health, and self-esteem of infants. Predisposing factors for ECC is considered to be multifactorial and is still unclear. The association between feeding practices and caries remains controversial with some studies finding no correlation, while others showing relation. ECC is a complex entity in which feeding practices alone does not play a prime role but is influenced by a myriad of cultural, behavioral, biological and microbiological factors. So, the area has conflicting reports which needs further research.",

      "abstract": "Introducción. En la actualidad, pese a haber avanzado en los derechos legales de las personas con diversidad afectivo-sexual, siguen habiendo prejuicios sociales al respecto. Este hecho se ve multiplicado en las personas mayores, que han sufrido una educación más homófoba y una mayor invisibilización de su sexualidad, por lo que se hace necesario investigar también en esta población. Método. Participaron 139 personas, de entre 50 y 73 años, con una media de 56,1 años (DT=5,44), siendo el 40,3% mujeres y el 59,7% hombres. El 89,9% se definían como heterosexuales y el 10,1% como no heterosexuales. Todos cumplimentaron un cuestionario sobre la vivencia de su orientación sexual. Resultados. El 50% de personas no heterosexuales, como consecuencia de su orientación sexual, se ha sentido rechazado, el 42,9% ha experimentado malestar, el 28,6% sufrió violencia verbal y el 14,3% violencia física. Así, se observan diferencias significativas entre las personas no heterosexuales y las heterosexuales en diversos aspectos relacionados con su orientación sexual, siendo las no heterosexuales las que muestran mayor malestar emocional (χ²=20,61; p&lt;,000), más dudas con su orientación (²=15,01; p&lt;,000), han sufrido más violencia verbal (χ²=18,03; p&lt;,000) y más violencia física (χ²=18,11; p&lt;,000. Conclusiones. Estos hallazgos confirman que el rechazo social de algunas orientaciones sexuales puede suponer una fuente de malestar emocional, así como un factor de riesgo para ser víctima de la violencia. En general, las personas con una orientación no heterosexual mostrarían mayor afectación emocional y mayor probabilidad de sufrir agresiones. Con el fin de mejorar esta situación, cabría analizar qué variables pueden mediar en estos resultados para establecer estrategias adecuadas de prevención e intervención a lo largo de todo el ciclo vital.",

However, the sexuality of people with disabilities is viewed negatively, and it is marked by numerous prejudices, myths and discrimination, for example, that people with disabilities are asexual, unable to engage in sexual activity or have a lower sexual desire. Due to stigmatization, denial of information and general ignorance, people with disabilities are confused about their sexual identity and reduced self-esteem, and often are victims of sexual violence, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Apart from disability, parents and society have been shown to be a barrier to the development of sexuality, and the key problem is the lack of knowledge of the importance of sexuality. Therefore, I consider it important to consider the development of healthy sexuality in people with disabilities and to work on promoting their sexual rights, with key factors being adequate sexual education and open conversations with parents and professionals.",

Despite the prevalence of sexual dysfunction (SD) among people with multiple sclerosis (MS), it is too frequently underreported and undertreated. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people with MS, in particular, may face stigma, discrimination, and clinician hesitancy that can bar access to necessary sexual health care. Recognizing SGM identity can help clinicians deliver more inclusive general and sexual health care, including but not limited to family planning and gender-affirming care. The 8 Ps model can aid in taking a nonjudgmental sexual history that allows for recognition of sexual dysfunction regardless of identity.",

      "title": "Gender differences in executive functions in students in the third triad of elementary school",
      "abstract": "An individual has a biological sex, which can be female, male, undetermined or unspecified. Through social and sexual conventions in society, an individual can develop his or her (or other) own gender representation which can refer to their biological sex or not and is interpreted by others according to the gender framework of a certain culture. Traditionally, we view gender as cultural or societal qualities that are related to biological sex. Theories of gender differences are based on a bipolar model of masculinity-femininity which is used to attribute certain behavioral and personal traits. Gender theory thus argues that a person is a product of culture, not nature, and it seeks to prove that masculinity and femininity traits are a consequence of a certain social and cultural context of each specific period. Gender differences can thus be viewed from different perspectives – from biological, psychological, biosocial perspective, etc. Understanding the exact nature of executive functions – as capacities of intentional and independent behavior that develop from early childhood together with the prefrontal cortex – in a school environment is limited due to lack of research which would examine these differences between the sexes. Executive functions can affect the formation of certain deficits and can directly or indirectly influence the students’ academic achievement as such. Findings in the research mostly highlight girls’ advantage in the verbal tasks and boys’ advantage in the spatial and working memory task. The main problem of my master’s thesis was the question of gender differences in executive functions. I predicted that there are major differences between the sexes in this area which I tested with measuring the following executive functions such as verbal fluency, working memory, switching ability, and inhibition in students (n = 101) in the third triad of elementary school, aged between 13 and 15 years. I used a test battery for measuring executive functions (Slana, Pecjak, and Repovs, 2017) with four tasks to measure these functions. I confirmed statistically significant differences (p < 0,01) between the sexes. Girls performed better in verbal fluency and working memory tasks, and boys in inhibition and switching tasks. I measured the connection between these four executive functions. Only lexical verbal fluency and working memory were connected statistically significantly (p < 0,01). I also examined the association between average final grades and the results of measured executive functions. The results of the correlational analysis showed the connection (p < 0,01) with all the measures of verbal fluency and working memory. Understanding the gender differences in executive functions has provided an insight into students' strengths on the theoretical level and indicated the potential for training less successful students in these functions for improving their academic performance in the practical level.",

      "title": "On delayed social and physical maturation in mountain sheep",
      "abstract": "American mountain sheep are neotenic or paedogenic, depending on their sex. The rams have a juvenile (neotenic) period lasting 5 to 6 years after sexual maturation, during which they develop physically and mature behaviorally. Rams almost double in body weight after sexual maturation, increase their horn mass, grow darker in color, and lose the white fur on belly and legs, grow less gregarious, become more polished in the social behavior by increasing display patterns and reducing aggressive and sexual patterns, and act more \"brave\" with age. They reach ultimate development and maturation between 7 and 9 years of age. Females are paedogenic since they remain frozen in development at the level of sexually mature yearling rams. Females possess two behavioral states: in estrus they act like young males, but in anestrus they act like sexually immature sheep. Sheep attain strong sexual dimorphism as a consequence of the postpuberal growth of males. The slow behavioral maturation of rams, which is paralleled by physical development, suggests that the quantitative expression of social behavior is a factor of the rams' physical development; the quantitative similarities in behavior between young rams and estrous females suggest that this view is valid.",

Um dos temas que mais se destacam nesse sentido e a sexualidade, que reune desde a descoberta sexual do individuo e suas mudancas corporais ate doencas sexualmente transmissiveis e metodos de prevencao. Dentro desse escopo, uma vertente que tem chamado a atencao e a assexualidade, popularmente entendida como o ato de nao sentir atracao fisica/sexual por outros individuos, sejam estes de sexo oposto ou do mesmo sexo. Partindo da realidade de que pelo menos 10 milhoes de brasileiros se identificam nessa condicao, coube perguntar: como e possivel descrever os denominados adolescentes assexuais? Por mais que muitos trabalhos dissertem sobre a relacao entre adolescencia e sexualidade, percebe-se que poucos sao os que aprofundam o olhar a respeito dos jovens que nao sentem atracao fisica/sexual por outras pessoas. Aprofundar o conhecimento nessa vertente e uma contribuicao valiosa aos estudos na area de Saude do Adolescente. Esta pesquisa, portanto, sustentou como objetivo geral compreender o conceito de assexualidade aplicado a adolescencia. Dentre os objetivos especificos, pode-se mencionar: estudar o que e a saude sexual do adolescente; pesquisar quais sao as definicoes de assexualidade; e revisar como a assexualidade se manifesta na adolescencia. Para que se realizasse esta pesquisa, optou-se pelo metodo qualitativo, de objetivo exploratorio, com levantamento de dados, ancorada na revisao de fontes bibliograficas e documentais. Em outras palavras, fez-se uma revisao bibliografica dividida em tres etapas: (1) saude sexual do adolescente; (2) assexualidade; (3) assexualidade na adolescencia. Com a conclusao deste trabalho, acreditou-se, que, com a insercao de educacao sexual nas escolas e as devidas nocoes sobre o tema aos jovens, muitos adolescentes que nao se sentem representados pela sexonormatividade possam se sentir seguros em outras formas para expressao de seus sentimentos.",

Child sex offenders evoke extraordinarily strong feelings in most individuals and communities, and those who assess and attempt to manage their current and future dangerousness do so in a climate that is unforgiving and hyperbolic. The stakes in respect of sexual offenders seem higher, since a badly constructed or inadequate assessment will fail to identify the sources of the individual's problems and, thereby, deny them the opportunity to address them. The assessor needs to balance optimism about the capacity of even the most reprehensible individuals to change with a scepticism that allows for the possibility that the real and covert goal of the individual may be to avoid changing at all. Actuarial risk assessment for sexual offenders rests upon a number of researched features that are associated with reconviction.",

      "abstract": "In order\n to detect differences between gonadectomized and\n sexually intact pet dogs an online survey for dog owners was created. Health\n issues were analysed from 6854 dogs and behavioural aspects from 1063 adult\n dogs between the ages of four and eight years. The observations made by the\n owners were correlated with sex, age, reproductive status and age at gonadectomy of the dogs. Only a few behavioural\n differences were found between gonadectomized and\n intact dogs. Dogs which were spayed/neutered before\n social maturity were considered to be more anxious than intact conspecifics.\n No association between prepubertal castration and\n aggression towards conspecifics of the same sex was found. Neutered males\n showed polyphagia much more often than intact males.\n For dogs\n being kept without the possibility of uncontrolled reproduction, neutering\n should be considered on a case by case basis. Among others, the behaviour of\n the dog, its “use” and the housing conditions should be taken into account.\n The\n requirement for prepubertal castration should be\n evaluated carefully. Like the socialisation phase, puberty seems to be a\n sensitive period for the brain development. How exactly the gonadal hormones\n act on maturation development and anxiety and if there are inter-individual\n differences in dogs has not yet been explored. The role of extra-gonadal\n produced sex hormones is unclear. Due to a\n highly variable impact of neutering on behaviour of a male dog, a reversible\n downregulation of gonadal function with a GnRH-agonist is recommended.",

El reconocimiento social y profesional de la realidad adolescente en relacion con la salud afectiva- sexual y reproductiva, y de las dificultades de acceso a los servicios normalizados para ser atendidos en sus necesidades, hizo posible la creacion de servicios de atencion especifica a los adolescentes y jovenes, desde una vertiente preventiva y de salud integral.",

      "abstract": "Narcissism has long been associated with diminished sexual and overall relationship satisfaction, but this association has not been investigated in the larger context of sexual function/dysfunction, also known to affect these outcome variables. Using a multivariate approach, this study investigated the relationships among sexual narcissism, sexual function/dysfunction, and sexual and overall relationship satisfaction in 1297 men completing an online survey about sexual history, sexual health, sexual function/dysfunction, and narcissism. Results indicated widespread differences on various sexual parameters between narcissistic and non-narcissistic men, with narcissistic men showing higher sexualization overall as well as higher auto-erotic orientation. Higher sexual narcissism was also significantly associated with various symptoms of sexual impairment, including a propensity toward both premature ejaculatory response and delayed ejaculatory response. Despite this association, both sexual narcissism and sexual function/dysfunction scores also independently predicted sexual and overall relationship satisfaction. Discussion focuses in part on explaining how two diametrically opposed sexual problems—rapid ejaculation and delayed/inhibited ejaculation—might play out sequentially in the sexual relationships of narcissistic men.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the history of mankind, children have only sometimes been spared to indignities, cruelties, and horrors that human beings so often inflict upon each other. At various times, in various places, children have been abandoned, starved, beaten, enslaved, sexually assaulted, and put to death. One such horror- child abuse – have become serious social problems in the united states and in some other industrialized societies, yet it occurs infrequently or not at all in many of the world’s societies. Child abuse seem’ s to increase in situations of rapid socio- cultural change, urban migration, family disorganization, and the like, no clear cut set of prognostic variables has been identified. Indeed, it seems that factors that predict child abuse in one society will not be predictive in another. Only active public and professional concerns led to the emergence of the truer picture of all forms of the child abuse and neglect: physical, sexual, emotional, and failure to thrive owing to maternal deprivation. The present paper is an attempt to make a comprehensive analysis and study of child abuse which is existing in different form and how they have been addressed in different existing legislation and government policies.",

This article presents a discussion of material from in-depth interviews with two men who took part in a larger study of masculinity and health-related behavior. These two young men spontaneously referred to themselves during in-depth interviews as not being a “manly man” or a “man's man.” Consideration of what these men said provides interesting insights into the links between discourses of masculinity and subjective experiences of masculinity—particularly whether masculinity is perceived in binary or pluralistic terms. The experiences of these two young men give hope to young men who reject hegemonic masculinity but still desire to have a clear masculine identity.",

      "title": "The Evolutionary Basis for Human Tolerance – Physiological Responses",
      "abstract": "For most animals, unfamiliar members of other groups present more of a threat than an opportunity, and are best avoided or even attacked. In contrast, our attitudes are markedly different. There is no denying that we are capable of being hostile to people we do not know, particularly if we feel anxious or threatened. However, compared to other animals, we are unusually open to new relationships, and form strong bonds with individuals outside our family group. Although we tend to focus on the ‘thinking’ part of our minds, or our cognitive appraisal of social situations, our physiological responses and emotional reactions play a central role in how we build and maintain relationships. Subtle changes in ‘gut feelings’ can have an important influence on our attitudes to people around us, particularly to unfamiliar outsiders or people we have not seen for some time. An understanding of how different hormones affect social behaviour in other species, as well as in humans, provides insights into the type of changes that led to increasing human ‘friendliness’. Genetic and anatomical evidence documents subtle changes in neuroendocrine function in recent human evolution after 300,000 years ago that appear to have played an important role in increasing tolerance of unfamiliarity, and abilities to forge new external bonds. Being able to make external connections, and form new relationships based on give and take despite lengthy periods apart, seems to have been important to our success as a species. Friends in distant communities may often have been important to survival by providing resources or help that could buffer the effects of crises and resource shortfalls. We find that it is genuine emotional commitments to distant friends, rather than strategic alliances, that allow modern hunter-gatherers to survive in times of crisis. Changes in emotional dispositions towards being less aggressive and more tolerant of unfamiliar individuals might seem to be progress, but we should be cautious in thinking in these terms. Increased ‘friendliness’ is not without its disadvantages. It also brings downsides in terms of social sensitivities and emotional vulnerabilities that influence much of human behaviour.",

      "title": "Menopause and the workplace: consensus recommendations from The Menopause Society",
      "abstract": "Menopause is a natural life transition experienced by half the world's population. Women aged 50 years and older are the fastest growing demographic group in many countries, making essential contributions to the workforce. Although menopause is a universal and natural life transition, the symptom experience is highly variable among women. Some women may experience few or no symptoms, whereas others may be bothered by moderate to severe symptoms for a decade or longer, which can adversely affect quality of life, relationships, job satisfaction, and career advancement. Indeed, menopause symptoms, including vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, as well as sleep and mood disturbances are associated with multiple adverse work outcomes. Studies to date have demonstrated that these adverse work outcomes related to menopause symptoms include a compromised ability to work, reduced work productivity, absenteeism, and even loss of employment or an early exit from the workforce. Further, the relationship between menopause symptoms and work may be bidirectional, with certain aspects of the work environment being linked with a greater menopause symptom burden, such as insufficient restroom facilities, unpredictable or long work hours, the inability to take breaks, and confined or crowded workspaces. Thus, workplace solutions may need to be tailored based on women's individual needs, the work environment, and the type of work.The Menopause Society, in conjunction with an expert panel of medical and legal experts and women's health advocates, has developed a set of consensus recommendations that challenges employers to create a menopause-supportive workplace for their employees. These recommendations include, among other things, suggestions for employers to review policies and healthcare plans and benefits and to consider flexibility and accommodations that may be needed for some women with menopause symptoms. Guidance for women with menopause symptoms that affect them at work in terms of understanding their resources and empowering them to be self-advocates are also provided, as well as recommendations for what occupational health professionals should know and do for women with bothersome menopause symptoms in the workplace.",

Yet, little is known about which behaviors people might experience as compulsive. Using YouGov America, a non-probability sample was collected, matched to U.S. representative norms, stratified, and weighted based on sample characteristics to ensure representativeness (N = 2,806; Mean Age = 48.9, SD = 17.3). Participants reported if they had experienced any concerns about their sexual behaviors being either \"out of control\" or \"an addiction.\" Participants who endorsed such concerns were then asked to indicate which behaviors had led to such concerns, using a checklist of 11 potentially overlapping sexual behaviors (e.g. frequent casual sexual encounters, using apps to find sexual partners). Men—both heterosexual and gay/bi/other–were more likely to report concerns that their sexual behaviors were an addiction, relative to heterosexual women. Relative to heterosexual women, men of any sexual orientation were more likely to report pornography use as a specific behavior of concern, and less likely to report partnered sexual behaviors. More religious participants were more likely to endorse masturbation as a behavior of concern and less likely to endorse frequent casual sexual encounters.",

      "title": "Aggression among Chandigarh High School Students: To Know the Prevalence and Level of Aggression in Terms of Gender",
      "abstract": "IntroductionAdolescence is viewed as a period during which biological, cognitive, emotional and social changes and development takes place. Because of reorganization in all of the developmental areas, young children face various behavioral of adjustment problems (1). It is often assumed that this is a difficult period of life, with the adolescents being at risk of high stress, since they have to cope with enormous changes. Some of these changes are in the physical and sexual behavior following puberty, some of the social and financial area, and some relate to decisions about the future .Thus, this period is certainly a period of change in which the adolescents are burdened by various pressures (2).It is very important that adolescents pass through this stage successful otherwise problems may occur that may further lead to the formation of various kinds of deviant behavior like aggression, drug and alcohol use. Erikson (3) further argues that adolescents typically experience diffusion, a strong sense of uncertainty and need to achieve a sense of identity. But at this phase of life they find it hard to do this and are always perturbed about who they are and what their future will be? Such unanswered questions might lead to frustration and aggressive behavior among the adolescents (4,5).Further, biological or hormonal changes in adolescents (increased level of androgen and testosterone) are also associated with behavioral problems like rebelliousness, talking back to adults, and fighting with classmates (6).Thus, emphasizing upon the critical nature of adolescent stage, it is apparent that adolescence and aggression cannot be separated. Many studies tracing the problems of adolescence over several decades have shown an increase in the rate of aggression among the adolescents (7).Aggression is defined as physical or verbal behavior intended to harm. Aggression can either be directed inward by self-mutilation or directed outwardly at another person. Aggressive behavior is often used to claim status, precedents or access to an object or territory (8). According to Eysenck (2), two kinds of aggression are identified namely, person oriented and instrumental aggression. Person oriented aggression is designed to hurt someone else were causing harm in the main goal. In contrast, instrumental aggression has its main goal in obtaining some desired reward with aggression. Another category of aggression is based on the initiator of the aggression.Proactive aggression is aggressive behavior that is initiated by the individual to achieve some desired outcomes whereas reactive aggression in an individual reaction to someone else aggression.These distinctions clearly revealed that aggression is not simple but a complicated aspect .It is not a single idea but it is of various types such as physical or verbal aggression.Physical aggressionAs the word indicates physical aggression is any response that produces or is intended to produce physical injury or physical pain in the victim or damage to an object. It involves the acts of hitting and kicking (9). The large body mass or higher physical development among the early adolescents is also an important predictor of the growing physical aggression among them. This is particularly supported by Trembley (10) who studied the association among the testosterone, physical development, and social behavior during early adolescence. He suggests that adolescents with larger body masses are more likely to be physically aggressive or socially dominant and tend to have higher testosterone levels, when provoked; adolescents tend to show physical aggressive behavior; like they would hit the person who irritates them.Verbal aggressionBurbank (11) reports that children are involved in violence and physical aggression until they have attained the verbal skills but when these are developed, physical aggression is replaced by verbal aggression up to some extent. …",

      "abstract": "Girls' experiences of object loss, in conjunction with female anatomical structure, may lend themselves to a particular genital anxiety regarding openness and emptiness. The relational void in giving up the mother as love object may lead to an internal self-representation of a \"hole\" to be filled, much as the mouth sucks the pacifier in the absence of the nipple. This image may then be extended to the genital representation. In turning to the father, a girl may find that she lacks a relationship with him in the relational space opened up by the loss of the mother; the penis is symbolically withheld from her in the father's relational distance. This lack of sexual and relational gratification, it is proposed, may be schematized by a female as her body being empty of something. The father's absence--the absence of the paternal penis--may lead to an absence of the mental representation of the vagina and to an inhibition of the role the vagina then plays for a woman in sexual desire. Vaginal repression may serve to disguise object hunger that might otherwise be experienced as vaginal longing. An abbreviated clinical vignette, revolving around a masturbatory fantasy, is offered in partial illustration of the thesis.",

The common denominators underlying these various systems consist of unrealistic beliefs that set off and maintain unrealistic fears that heterosexual functioning and graficiation will be hurtful to self. Distortions of beliefs and convictions about sexuality are established in childhood as a consequence of adverse influences on sexual development. Destructive attitudes are usually exerted by parents but also by other power figures in and outside the family. The most common sexual disorders seen in the general population are dysfunctions such as impotence, premature ejaculation, frigidity, and other operational problems; however, psychological difficulties linked to sexual behavior, though not usually recognized as sexual, are far more common— falling in love, maintaining long-term love relationships, resistance to marriage, and postpartum reactions.",

Theories of sexual addiction suggest that these individuals regulate their emotions poorly, as evidenced by coactivation of positive and negative emotions during sexual stimulation. Men and women who either reported problems down-regulating their use of VSS (VSS-P, N = 71) or no problem regulating use of VSS (VSS-C, N = 49) watched a neutral film and a sexual film. They reported their positive and negative feelings after each film. Unexpectedly, the VSS-P group exhibited significantly less coactivation of positive and negative affect to the sexual film than VSS-C. This is inconsistent with emotion dysregulation, supposedly a key feature of “hypersexual disorder.” Affect regulation could be failing at a different stage of sexual stimulus processing not studied.

      "title": "The paediatrician and the sexually abused child",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Sexual abuse is an aspect of cruelty to children which merits greater scientific attention. It has potential for damaging the mental health of the victim and intergenerational cycles of this behaviour pattern may develop. The paediatrician is in a position to detect children at risk and may be able to intervene. Three types of sexual abuse are described (i) single sexual attacks which may be accompanied by physical violence: (ii) sexual exploitation of children for financial gain, and (iii) longstanding sexual relationships, generally between girls and father figures; these are far the most common. Although it is hard to separate the effects of premature sexual experience from other adverse environmental influences. the child victim of longstanding sexual abuse emerges immature, with considerable confusion as to her role in the family, and with constricted personality development. Her primary motivation is attention seeking, and she adopts sexual activity with an adult as a means of survival in often deplorable conditions. The sensitivity of management following the assault being made public is an important factor in determining eventual adjustment.",

This raises some important considerations for therapy and counseling, and kink-aware therapists might bring a special set of skills and approaches to working with bisexual or pansexual clients. A qualitative analysis of 25 interviews with kink-identified, bisexual/pansexual/queer identified people highlighted the following patterns: the term queer, for some people, includes kink or BDSM sexualities; kink activities can be avenues for exploring gender identity and sexual orientation; and kink activities and community can be important elements in healing from shame, isolation, grief, and loss. Discussions of possible elements of competent care are reviewed in relation to kink sexuality and identity.",

The current increasing tendency is also quite noticeable in our country，which have resulted in a strong growth in the elderly population aged 65 and older. ln the third age，sustaining a happy sexual life would be closely related to the establishment of self respect and self-preservation. so， therefore， in the field of the clinical geropsychotogical counseling， the parts of sexual life that are not brought to light should be regarded as a subject of prime importance. Before everything. in clinical geropsychological counseling，whether or not medical illness which could cause sexual problems exist should be ascertained. If they suffer from such medical illness，it should be properly managed before the counseler could take up the main subject, The elderly who lose one's husband or wife should be encouraged to have good chances to contact，meet. and even marry a new partner. In order to provide sound opportunities to the elderly and creat a elderly-friendly social environment it would be necessary for professionals who have adequate experiences in geropsychotogical sexual counseling and professional institutes which deals with the geropsychology sexual conflict to come forth in large numbers. In case of psychosocial problems，the elderly should be consulted with professional doctors immediately. Professional doctors who have the necessary competence of open-heartedness ， catholicity, and expertise would help Ihe elderly envisage Iheir problems squarely. Pro1essional doctors，other professionals who would be engaged in geropsychological sexual counseling ，and even generat geriatric care givers should hold on to the uncritical attutude toward the personal sexual orientation and individual characteristic of sexual behavior of the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study was designed to explore in depth the relational experiences of five gay men who identified themselves as having difficulty developing intimate relationships with other men. The premise of the study was that these men's early paternal object relations, represented in unconscious phantasy, influence their adult object relations, also represented in unconscious phantasy, as powerfully mediated by the internalization of a heterosexist interpersonal environment during boyhood. The chief hypothesis was that the experience of growing up within a heterosexist environment would have a strong and negative influence on these men's subsequent relationships. I found that, for these five men, the dominant factor in their adult relationships was their internalized childhood relationships with their fathers, as represented in their unique, unconscious phantasies. However, a further, unexpected cross-case finding was that these men's phantasies about the experience of a painful outcome to the Oedipus (the loss of the primary oedipal object), seemed to have been powerfully re-stimulated by later experiences of rejection, or fear of rejection, by adolescent male peers. The consequence of this particular, psychically resonating experience appeared to be that these men re-worked their unconscious phantasies, incorporating their painful adolescent experiences into their negative underlying phantasies about themselves in relation to other males.",

In spite of this it can be said that the biological bases in men and in women are characterized by lower speed and intensity. The old people's attitude towards sexuality in general and their own sexuality is still less liberal than the attitude of younger persons. The frequency of sexual intercourse decreases, mainly because of lack of partners or because of health problems. There are many other forms of sexual behavior; especially, the importance of tenderness is increasing. A theoretical model of factors influencing the sexuality in old age is presented. Practical considerations concerning the prevention in young and in older people, treatment of older people in the physician's practice and their living in institutions conclude the article.",

Often, a bond between animal and human results, which is based on affection and/or respect. In the research environment, it is not uncommon for a bond to develop between the investigator, veterinarian, and/or animal care technicians and the animals with which they work; and such a bond can be just as strong for a mouse as it is for a dog. Circumstances that foster the formation of these bonds include the close and frequent contact between the researchers and their animals during studies or during training of animals to particular tasks, the long periods of time many research animals live in the facilities (often years), the dependency of the animals on the animal care staff for their daily needs, and the veterinarian/patient relationship, which is not unlike that of private practitioners and client-owned animals. In addition, overlaying the fundamental relationship with the research animal are special bonds that can form with certain animals. Among those that engender a special attachment are animals that are particularly friendly, amusing, or intelligent; animals requiring extra supportive care; animals that show courage; animals that represent a milestone in a particular scientific advancement; and animals that reflect humans' own strengths and foibles. The development of these relationships is enriching to both personnel and animals inasmuch as people who care about their animals are committed to promoting and ensuring the well-being of those animals.",

This research tried to target the central cores and peripheral elements of all these social representations, by means of the “free association” and the “emotional cards”, to estimate for all actors, the possible progress regarding acceptance, and consequently, accompaniment of intimacy and sexuality about institutionalized mentally-handicapped adults. Brain-damaged adults (acquired handicap) and people with mental disabilities (congenital handicap) were the main protagonists of this research. The results show that according to the type of handicap (acquired or congenital), the caregivers’ posture is almost the same; that of the resident differ themselves slightly; as for that some caregivers-loving-accompanying and families are radically different: people with congenital disabilities do not create an intimate imagination and/or sexual from them, to their mentallyhandicapped adult.

      "abstract": "Problematic sexual behaviors are frequently encountered in the treatment of patients suffering Dissociative Identity Disorder and related forms of dissociative disorders. These may include unfortunate patterns of ready acquiescence or submission to overtly or potentially aggressive or sexual approaches/encounters, subtle and/or overt seductive signaling and behaviors, and even overt sexually provocative patterns of verbalizations and actions. This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma. Clinical manifestations are described and discussed. An animal model in which sexual behaviors substitute for aggressive behaviors is described. A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to exogenous trauma. Exploration of this model may lead to improved understandings and approaches to trauma victims who manifest such behavior, hopefully destigmatizing them further, facilitating reduction of their shame and guilt, and supporting their recoveries. Clinical interventions are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Prairie voles are a monogamous species and males show paternal behavior. After mating, paternal responsiveness increases gradually during the gestation period, peaking before young are born. We examined the importance of cohabitation with a female and the time course for a gradual intensification of paternal care. Males housed with their brothers since weaning were separated. Each male was housed alone, with a strange female, or with a brother. A male housed with a female remained with her either until mating occurred or throughout gestation. Males in each group were tested for paternal behavior 3 times, in early, mid and late gestation periods. Males that were housed alone attacked the young more than those housed with another vole. A male exposed to a female, whether he had mated or not, engaged in more parenting than a male exposed to a brother. A male that remained with his mate during the gestation period was more parental than an isolated male that was housed alone. Contact with another vole reduces infanticidal tendencies; brief physical contact with a female, with or without mating, intensifies paternal responsiveness; and further cohabitation is not essential.",

      "abstract": "Although thought to be trivial, microaggressions have severe mental and physical impact on the individuals of the targeted groups or populations. The fact that this form of discrimination is mostly hidden, common and hard to identify makes it extremely difficult for the victims to protect themselves or respond appropriately to its occurrences. Microaggressions are covert discriminatory verbal, visual, or societal/individual attitudes embedded in everyday life communications whether intentional or unintentional against a person or a group based on religious, ethnic or gender affiliations. Microaggressions degrade, marginalize, and alienate the target group or person causing significant mental and physical harm to the victim. Microaggressions have three types: micro assault, microinsult, and micro-invalidation. The continuous exposure to these aggressive acts increases the risk for serious mental disorders with increased need for psychiatric care. At many societies, Muslim are a main target for microaggressions that is specifically intensified with the propagation of Islamophobia. Mental health professionals have to ensure culture sensitive care by first and far most face their own biases and the societal influences on their practices, believes and ethics. Literature review of online data and research was conducted. Three books directly related to the subject were reviewed. The main objectives were to understand the forms of racial/religion discrimination impeded in society targeting Muslim, the psychological impact of microaggressions, biases in psychiatric care, and ways to help this particular group. Healthcare systems and mental health providers are not immune from engaging in microaggressions. They are required to understand these patterns of insults as it will cause farther confusion to their patients and increase resentment and mistrust to the care they provide to this group.",

      "abstract": "Children’s behaviour, its definition, assessment and regulation, is rarely out of the news. It remains the focus of both professional and popular discourses, constantly labelled and regularly invoking calls for greater intervention. Within the ensuing debates the ‘mad’, ‘bad’ or ‘sad’ child is publicly defined and rarely consulted. Invariably, the public and professional debates turn on the conflated issues of ‘acceptable’ behaviour and ‘normality’. The process of defining, identifying, explaining and responding to deviant or ‘abnormal’ behaviour becomes the vital reference point against which normality is itself defined. What has emerged is a process, in both professional and popular discourse, based on binary opposition. Yet it is an arbitrary process that sets boundaries around normality without reflecting on historical, cultural, ideological, socioeconomic and political contingencies. What follows is a critique of this process as it relates to children and young people whose behaviour is defined as ‘disturbed’ or ‘disturbing’. While clinical studies have attempted to give scientific rigour to judgements about disturbed or disturbing behaviour in children and young people, they rely heavily on adults – parents and professionals – to make initial judgements that determine particular behaviours as problematic. Thus, “we have to see clinicians in their social role as authoritative interpreters of disturbance, adding a further layer to the commonsense definitions used by parents” (Grimshaw and Berridge, 1994, p 8). As Steinberg states: The process by which adolescents become psychiatric patients has as much to do with the feelings and behaviour of other people, and with social customs and routines, as with anything happening inside their heads.",

      "title": "Men’s Provisioning of Oral Sex",
      "abstract": "Men sometimes engage in noncopulatory sexual behaviors, such as cunnilingus and other kinds of sexual foreplay. Men involved in long-term romantic relationships, in particular, tend to provision their partners with oral sex. Potential adaptive functions of cunnilingus in humans are discussed with a focus on the hypothesis that men use oral sex provisioning as part of a general benefit-provisioning, long-term mating strategy. Other potential adaptive functions are also considered, including the infidelity detection hypothesis and several hypotheses concerning sperm competition adaptations. Some research has proposed the possibility that men may use oral sex as a form of infidelity detection, wherein they might be able to smell or taste the semen of rival males in their partner’s vagina. Other research has posited that men might perform cunnilingus in order to induce orgasm in their partners, thereby increasing the amount of sperm retained in her reproductive tract after ejaculation. Still others have suggested that men might perform cunnilingus to increase their own arousal, thus increasing their subsequent ejaculate volume. These adaptive perspectives are couched within the wider literature on oral sex, which includes data regarding the frequency of oral sex in adolescent, preindustrial and non-Western samples, as well as women’s desire for receiving oral sex. Regarding the relative infrequency of cunnilingus in preindustrial and non-Western samples, in particular, men’s provisioning of oral sex is considered as potentially being a part of an evolved cognition for benefit-provisioning mate retention in general, rather than oral sex itself serving a specific adaptive function. Specifically, oral sex may be one type of sexual favor that men, especially those in Western cultures, sometimes provide to their long-term partners. Additional data regarding the increased sexual and relationship satisfaction in women who engage in a wider variety of sexual practices and who more frequently experience orgasm further supports the mate retention hypothesis of men’s provisioning of oral sex. Nevertheless, the available literature investigating these potential adaptive functions is currently insufficient to draw any decisive conclusions. Finally, gaps in the current literature and suggestions for future research that may help determine the evolved nature of men’s oral sex provisioning are discussed.",

      "abstract": "One hundred and nine men (38 per cent single, 48 per cent married) participated in a survey of the prevalence of erectile and ejaculatory difficulty in a non-clinical sample. Perceived aetiology of erectile difficulty was also investigated. Twenty-three per cent of the sample were currently experiencing sexual problems, with ejaculatory difficulty approximately three times as prevalent as erectile difficulty. Nearly one-quarter had experienced erection difficulties at some time and, of these, 68 per cent had remitted without formal treatment. Most frequently cited 'causes' of erectile difficulty were 'psychological' rather than 'physical', 'practical' or specifically 'sexual,' with relationship factors including communication between partners being perceived as particularly important. The presence of erectile and/or ejaculatory difficulty was related to sexual dissatisfaction but not to ratings of relationship happiness. Men having sexual relationships outside their permanent relationship found their partner less sexually attractive and rated themselves as less happy than those men not having affairs but the two groups did not differ in terms of presence of sexual difficulty or sexual dissatisfaction. The limitations of a sample biased towards younger, more educated men, are discussed.",

However, the issue did not receive widespread attention medically until the publication of Kempe's seminal work, The Battered Child Syndrome in 1962. The term was coined to characterize the clinical manifestations of serious physical abuse in young children. It is now evident that child abuse is a global problem, which occurs in a variety of forms and is deeply rooted in cultural, economic and social practices. Kempe described the sequence of the ways in which societies begin to perceive and socially construct the different forms of abuse. He described the first observation of the severely physically abused child, followed by an awareness of the neglected child, then an awareness that children could be rejected and emotionally abused in their families, and in institutions, or could be induced into illness states by parents who themselves need support through the medical pathway. He also described the process of recognition of the extensive inappropriate sexual activities with children.",

      "title": "Psychosexuality in Schizophrenia—Some Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Numerous features of the schizophrenic psychosis point to an immature level of psychosexual functioning. The question is raised whether this is due to deficiency of sex hormone. It is pointed out that sexual behavior in animals is largely determined by this factor: mating activity can be prevented by castration and precocious sex behavior can be induced by the use of primary sex hormones. The schizophrenic patient, however, usually has normal genitalia and probably excretes sex hormone in an approximately normal amount. Furthermore, castration in human beings seldom if ever gives rise to schizophrenia, nor does that operation have much influence on the psychosis if performed after its development. Although quantitative alterations in the sex hormone titre show little correlation with the psychosis it is theoretically possible that variations in responsivity to the hormones might be a factor. That such responsivity varies widely under different conditions is well known. Dissociation between the somatic and the psychodynamic reactions to the sex hormones is also possible under numerous conditions, e.g., precocious puberty in boys and girls is commonly not accompanied by much eroticism. Dissociation between sex hormone production and mating response can be demonstrated experimentally by the induction of lesions in the hypothalamus. Another theoretical possibility is that schizophrenia might be induced by imbalance in the titres of circulating androgen and estrogen as homosexuality is believed by some to be produced. This possibility is controverted by the infrequency with which administered sex hormone benefits homosexuality and by the fact that acquired sex reversal in man does not lead to schizophrenic symptomatology. Whether or to what extent schizophrenia might be due to qualitative abnormalities of sex hormone production is discussed. Evidence is cited that certain animals are more responsive in terms of sex behavior to stallion-urine extract than to testosterone. Evidence of aberrant sex hormone production in man is, however, lacking. Likewise lacking is evidence that the psychosexual perturbations of schizophrenia might be due to abnormalities in the metabolism of normal sex hormone. It seems probable that the psychosexual disharmony of schizophrenia is not to be ascribed therefore to immediate abnormality in either amount, balance or chemical nature of the sex hormones. The possibility remains that abnormal responsivity to these hormones might account for the psychosis and that successful normalization of the responsivity might be an effective therapeutic procedure.",

      "abstract": "Positive aspects of sexuality remain understudied among adolescents globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, consensus is lacking on how to conceptualize different aspects of sexual wellbeing among young people. We propose a new conceptual framework for adolescent sexual wellbeing that draws on existing theories and definitions, grounded in theories related to positive youth development, empowerment, human rights, gender, social-ecological and life-course perspectives. The framework highlights six interrelated domains of key competencies that are central to healthy adolescent sexuality development, whether or not sexual activities occur: 1) sexual literacy, 2) gender equal attitudes, 3) respect for human rights and understanding consent, 4) critical reflection skills, 5) coping skills and 6) interpersonal skills. These competencies have the potential both to strengthen and impede adolescents’ sexual wellbeing in relation to both themselves and others. Personal sexual wellbeing includes, but is not limited to, having a positive sense of one’s own (sexual) self and body, and recognising and appreciating feelings of pleasure and desire. Relational sexual wellbeing can include developing and maintaining mutually respectful, gender equal relationships with other people that are that are part of young people’s sexual socialisation, such as peers, parents and community members. Over time, relational sexual wellbeing may also include outcomes related to intimate partners, such as equality in relationships, safe and pleasurable sexual interactions, free from violence and coercion. Whether young people are able to translate competencies into desired actions and achieve a sense of sexual wellbeing depends on the personal, social and economic resources available to them, their (sexual) agency, and on the influence of opportunity structures such as policies, laws and norms. We end with discussing the potential implications of the framework for public health programmes and research studies aiming to improve adolescent SRHR and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "According to the latest results of Croatian Institute of Public Health, there are more and more children and young adults who are diagnosed with behavioral or mental disorders. Today, personality disorders in adolescence are in the focus, they are important health problem because those problems reflect on families and society in general. Last decades, some important scientific researches on personality disorders in adolescence are present. Adolescence is the period of maturing where the child prepares himself/herself for adulthood; it is the period of turbulence, emotional ambivalences and intensive changes in physical, psychic, emotional, cognitive and sexual development. Numerous risks, to which young people are exposed to, can interfere with normal transition through that period and stimulate occurrence of certain disorder in the mental health of adolescence. Personality disorder is the condition where behavior and experience stand out from habitually and normal behavior; it is not adapted; it interferes with normal functioning of a young adult and it is not justified with the situation where the young person find himself/herself. The cause of disorder is interpreted as the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risky environmental factors in the childhood take big part in its origin and development of personality disorders. There is a big vigilance in diagnosis of personality disorder in adolescence, because the fact that psychophysical development of a young adult is not finished yet, symptoms of a certain personality disorders must be present for at least one year. We distinguish several types of personality disorders that can be recognized by certain characteristics. Personality disorders are conditions; they are not mental illnesses, but if the symptoms are not recognized on time and the young person does not protect himself/herself from the risky situations and enviornment, peronality disorders can develop in that direction. The key point in the treatment of personality disorders is the early identification of the problem, setting the correct diagnosis and individual approach in choosing of methods of treatment. Psychotherapy is the most common type of treatment, in which cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis and group psychotherapy are most used. Which one will be used, depends on the assessment that best suits the person with personality disorder. In the program of the mental health protection of the youth, that are introduced on the national level, series of measuers and acitivites are pursued and directed towards the promotion and advancement of mental health, early recognition of difficulties and disorders in mental functioning, and work with high-risk children and youth. The approach is interdisciplinary, teachers and professional associates play the key role in those activities in educational institutions. Their education, consultation and permanent specialization are very important.",

      "abstract": "Feeling lonely motivates people to reconnect with others, but it can also trigger a vicious cycle of cognitions and behaviours that reinforces their loneliness. In this study, we examined the behavioural consequences of loneliness in a virtual social environment. A total of 176 participants navigated a character (protagonist) through a two-dimensional browser game and rated the character's loneliness multiple times during the game. In the first part of the game, another character is introduced as the protagonist's spouse. At one point, the spouse leaves for an undetermined period of time but later returns. Immediately before this separation, higher ascribed loneliness of the protagonist was associated with more frequent interactions with the spouse. After the reunion, however, higher ascribed loneliness was associated with less frequent interactions with the spouse. Ascribed loneliness was not significantly related to the frequency of interactions with others nor to the frequency of solitary activities. These patterns held after controlling for ascribed positive affect. Participants' levels of loneliness were related to the level of ascribed loneliness only when the spouse was present but not when the spouse was absent. In sum, these findings suggest that the conditions that trigger the vicious cycle of loneliness are person- and situation-specific.",

This life stage marks the transition from the social and physical characteristics of juveniles to those of an adult. This is an extensive phase in many primates when hormonally induced physiological, morphological, and behavioral maturations occur at different rates. Puberty results in a nonsynchronous pattern of maturity in reproductive, skeletal, and dental anatomy, body mass, and behavior that ultimately results in adulthood. Timing of puberty in primates can be influenced by demographic, ecological, and social factors. Using a life history framework, it is evident that this period of development is critical for the social, physical, sexual, and neurological development of primates.",

Among a sample of 260 self-identified kinky users of a kink-oriented social networking website living in 21 countries, we examined self-reported narratives of the origins of kink desires. An inductive coding process by four independent coders yielded 20 categories of responses, organized into five broad discourses about the origins of kinky desires: identity (e.g., personality, personal taste, and role exploration; 72.7% of responses), nurture (e.g., both traumatic and non-traumatic life experiences; 38.1% of responses), negation (e.g., disavowing or doubting a particular idea about the origins of their kink interests; 24.6% of responses), nature (e.g., biology and genetics; 22.7% of responses), and uncertainty (e.g., not being able to identify an origin of kinky desires; 10.4% of responses). Fewer than 19% of participants mentioned any kind of trauma in their responses. We discuss implications for scientific understandings of kinky sexual desire within the umbrella of sexual diversity.",

      "title": "The Significance of Penis Envy in Women",
      "abstract": "In every woman's analysis, there is inevitably a period in which appears a feeling of envy and covetousness for both the male sex organ and its symbolic equivalents. This penis envy may be simply episodic with some patients, but with others it can be central. Pseudo-desire, promulgated by envy, achieves a semblance of satisfaction, as shown in the phallic attitudes of some women, who are immersed in imitation of the other sex, or at least of the image they have of it. Penis envy will disappear by itself the day the patient no longer has that painful feeling of deficiency which caused it. If one agrees to abandon an object-oriented view of the envied penis— and to defer all questions concerning the sociocultural legitimacy of the envy—then one can undertake a truly psychoanalytical approach. The association of penis envy with conscious or unconscious hatred toward the mother is frequently observed.",

There are abusers are often affected by many cognitive biases related to mistaken beliefs about sex roles and distorted ideas about the legitimization of violence to solve problems. This paper is a literature review on the conceptualization of the term gender violence with an emphasis on multi-causal models and the construction of masculinity as explanatory variables of the origin and maintenance of abuse.Cuando se habla de violencia de género casi siempre se habla de mujeres, pocas veces se lanzan cuestiones sobre los hombres que ejercen esa violencia y sobre las causas y motivaciones que originan y mantienen su comportamiento. Las investigaciones consultadas no determinan un perfil concreto del hombre maltratador. Pueden ser personas machistas, inestables, adictos al alcohol o drogas o tener algún trastorno de personalidad, pero no existen datos concluyentes. En lo que sí hay acuerdo es en que los maltratadores suelen estar afectados por numerosos sesgos cognitivos relacionados con creencias equivocadas sobre los roles sexuales y con ideas distorsionadas sobre la legitimización de la violencia como forma de resolver los problemas. Este trabajo realiza una revisión bibliográfica sobre la conceptualización del término de violencia de género con una especial atención a los modelos multicausales y la construcción de la masculinidad como variables explicativas del origen y mantenimiento del maltrato.",

From associating primarily with same-sex friends during middle childhood, there is typically an increased interest in relationships with the opposite sex from the early to mid-teens onwards. Some experience of same-sex sexual behaviours is also not uncommon, and a minority of adolescents will describe themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Intimate partnerships start to be formed, with sexual and romantic elements. The issues of dating violence, sexting, teenage pregnancies, and early parenthood are considered along with the extended period of development in emerging adulthood.",

Sexual functioning requires an integration of neurological, vascular and endocrine systems and interpretation in the brain. As a complex biopsychosocial process, in addition to the biological factors, including health and psychological status of the person/couple (mood, personality traits), and psychosocial factors like religious beliefs, personal experience, ethnicity and socio-demographic conditions play an important role in sexual functioning and satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that sexual satisfaction does not always correlate with sexual function. Furthermore, partnered sexual activity involves interpersonal relationships and the unique attitudes, needs and responses of each of the partners. A problem in any of these areas may lead to sexual complaints or dysfunctions [1].",

A person is an individual of any age or who manifests characteristics, behaviours or self-expression, which in their own or someone else's perception is typical of or commonly associated with persons of another gender.The medical professionals, criminal justice systems and various other service providers along with family members, friends and society at large should be made aware and sensitized about transgender's and provide a support group.Key Words:Transgender.

At the instant of conception, our physical maleness and femaleness - our body shape and organs - were already determined. is a general term applied to a variety of individuals, behaviours, and groups involving tendencies to vary from the usual roles. A person is an individual of any age or who manifests characteristics, behaviours or self-expression, which in their own or someone else's perception is typical of or commonly associated with persons of another gender.Transgender are stigmatized in many parts of the world but has become more widely known in Western culture in the mid to late 20th century, concurrently with the sexual revolution and the development of sexual reassignment surgeries. Discrimination and negative attitudes towards transgender often accompany certain religious beliefs or cultural values. The issue of transgender is considered as a psycho-social disorder in most of the countries. In India it is seen as unnatural, wilful, vice and perversion. A transgender in India face many problems which even threat their fundamental right to live. This transphobia among the common population has made the existence of a transgender in struggle. As the issue of transgender is gaining wider attention and the attitude of the society towards the transgender remains unchanged, the problems faced by transgenders increases. In such a scenario, the social workers have a major role in improving the social status of transgender through various measures.Transgender is the state of one's gender identity (self-identification as women, man, or neither) not matching ones assigned sex (identification by others as male or female based on physical/genetic sex). Transgender does not imply any specific as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, or asexual.A transgender individual may have characteristics that are normally associated with a particular gender, identify elsewhere on the traditional continuum, or exit outside of it as other, agender, Gender queer , or third . people may also identify as bi-gender, or along several places on either the traditional transgender continuum, or the more encompassing continuums, which have been developed in response to the significantly more detailed studies done in recent years.In Tamil Nadu the equivalent term is Thirunangai (Daughter of god), Aravanni, Aravani, or Aruvani, Kothi and Double-deckers. A male who takes a receptive or feminine role in with a man will often identify as a Kothi (or the local equivalent term). They often dress as women and act in a feminine manner in public spaces, even using feminine languages to refer to themselves and each other. The usual partners of are masculine men, whose identity is as a 'normal' male who penetrates. These male partners are often married, and any relationship or with Kothis are usually kept secret from the community at large. Some Kothis may form relationship with men and even marry, although their marriages are not usually recognised by law or religion. Aravani is an equivalent term for transsexual, which refers the transgender who has undergone reassignment surgery. …",

The term \"sex determination\" refers to the development of gonadal sex—a process that occurs at approximately 6–7 weeks' gestation in the human male fetus, and around 10–11 weeks' gestation in the female fetus. Male sex determination is synonymous with testis determination. This process (alternatively called primary sex differentiation) results from a coordinated series of exquisitely regulated, but as yet incompletely understood, events. As generally used, the term \"sex differentiation,\" refers to the processes downstream of gonadal development—the processes that are regulated by gonadal secretions or lack thereof (also called secondary sex differentiation). In essence, the sex chromosome complement endowed at fertilization determines gonad type and the latter determines the pattern of differentiation seen in the genital ducts and external genitalia.",

      "title": "Bye-bye, sexuality",
      "abstract": "The psychoanalytic concept of sexuality continues to be misunderstood and confused as something else. For Freud, sexuality does not offer any firm ground where the subject can stand up, walk steadily, move forward easily and travel comfortably to a given destination. It does not ever represent some \"thing\" that men and women can conquer and/or possess. As a concept, it cannot be compared to gender, which offers culturally and socially reassuring explanations. In contrast, Freudian sexuality, bisexuality and sexual difference cannot be fitted into any model; they do not constitute a guide or a map full of recognizable signs to follow, like heavenly bodies in the firmament. Just the opposite: they produce confusion, anxieties, uncertainty. Sexuality is problematic and conflicting; unconscious desires will never be fully realized. If anything could be said about sexuality, it would be to characterize it as infantile and polymorphous; perverse and not gender-specific. It is also, in part, an unconsciously remembered event: it belongs to a previous moment in the subject's infantile life, now repeated, never forgotten: … once upon a time. … Suckling at the breast or playing and experimenting with different orifices of the body, for example, reappear in the foreplay of adult sexuality. This link is necessarily unconscious; paradoxically, the knowledge of this connection is not accepted by our consciousness, because it never existed in the first place – except, rather ironically, nachträglich. This irony can also be understood as a tragic joke: sexual pleasure is possible because the connection was, from the beginning, only there in the negative – completely unknown to the subject. 1",

This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm's way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control--the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-specific changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.",

This not uncommon concern is often expressed to pediatric endocrinologists who come into contact with these boys because of concerns with abnormal pubertal development. To explore the character and prevalence of these types of homosexual concerns we assessed the perceptions of a group of healthy adolescent males using a structured questionnaire. The aim of this study was to determine whether males concerned about homosexual tendencies manifest a unique self-perception profile or interact differently with others. A multi-item questionnaire regarding demographic, behavioral, psychological and sexual characteristics was administered to 52 18-24 year-old males. Overall, there were few differences between males admitting to an adolescent homosexual attraction to males and males without this attraction. Differences between these two groups included more exposure to some kinds of pornography (including male to male imagery), noticeable psychosexual responses to male pornography, internal questioning over homosexual tendencies, comparisons of genitalia and perceptions of body build. There were no differences in demographics, family structure, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, knowledge of puberty, inter-personal relationships or sources of information about sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Background Young autistic people often experience social isolation and loneliness. Despite social isolation and loneliness increasing in later life in non-autistic populations, no studies have examined whether middle-aged and older autistic adults are at an increased likelihood of these experiences. Methods 428 adults (autistic n = 265) aged 40–93 years (mean = 60.5 years) completed questionnaires related to social connectedness/isolation, loneliness, and mental health. Group differences and associations were examined. Results The autistic group was less socially connected and lonelier than the non-autistic group. While there were few gender differences in social connectedness, women were lonelier than men in both groups, including when controlling for age and mental health. Social connectedness decreased with age in both groups, loneliness only increased with age in the autistic group. For both social connectedness and loneliness, age associations were significantly stronger in men than women. Conclusions Autistic adults may be particularly susceptible to social isolation and loneliness in midlife and older age. While autistic women were lonelier than autistic men, autistic men may be at greater risk of increasing social isolation and loneliness with older age. This study highlights the need for evidence-based interventions to address social isolation and to reduce loneliness for autistic people as they age.",

      "title": "Suffering among Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract Suffering is a pervasive part of the human condition. From social, cultural, and medical perspectives, human suffering is often hidden under an assortment of other defined experiences, for example, colonization, marginalization, stigmatization, or illness symptomatology such as physical, mental, or chronic pain. As such, a focused examination of the condition of human suffering as a distinct entity has often been lacking. However, work in several disciplines within recent years has brought a specific focus to suffering as an object of study. As part of this effort, research has also centered on the experience of suffering in later life. Suffering can be defined as immersion in a profoundly difficult or troubling event or episode. Of critical significance to an understanding of suffering – and what makes it different from many negative experiences – is that suffering often provides a challenge to personal identity and threatens a stable sense of who one is in the world. Six negative factors relating to suffering may each form the basis of a more profound level of existential suffering. Some research on suffering in later life has focused on the relationship of suffering to both personal meaning and the experience of control.",

      "title": "Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Elder abuse is a global problem with an estimated 10% of older people experiencing some form of abuse although many cases remain unreported and/or not referred to social services. As such, the true extent of elder abuse is relatively unknown, and this poses significant challenges given recent demographic changes with people living longer. Maltreatment of older people, commonly referred to as elder abuse, is multidimensional and includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Elder abuse exists within a socio-ecological context with influences at the level of the individual, families, communities and society. The complex interplay between factors influencing elder abuse is challenging. Elder abuse may involve one or more types of abuse and may occur as a single or repeated act. A confounding problem is that those who carry out the abuse are often someone the older person knows well, such as partners, family members and friends. It may also be carried out by service providers who older people rely on in institutional and health care settings. In institutions or health care settings, elder abuse is most likely if staff lack education and training and/or there are inadequate resources to meet the care and support needs of older people. The outcomes from elder abuse are numerous and may result in poorer health, physical injuries, psychological morbidity and premature death. Due to the significant morbidity and premature mortality which may result from elder abuse, the physical, psychosocial and economic costs of elder abuse are considerable. Primary, secondly and tertiary interventions exist to address elder abuse. However, it is unclear what are the most effective interventions to prevent or reduce elder abuse across the diversity of settings. Given the wide range of possible elder abuse interventions and the lack of population knowledge about these, it is important to assess their possible benefits, effectiveness and any implications. The overall aim was to establish the effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary intervention programmes to prevent and/or reduce the occurrence of elder abuse in any setting (organizational, institutional and/or community settings). A further objective was to identify whether the interventions' effects were modified by types of abuse, types of participants, setting of intervention or cognitive status of older people (Baker, Francis, Hairi, Othman, & Choo, 2016). Participants in randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, and quasi-RCTs, before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series were older people (age over 60) and those who care for them. Studies eligible for inclusion included methods of preventing or reducing re-occurrence of elder abuse and required to have a minimum of 12 weeks of follow up. Elder abuse interventions were classified as any strategies intended to avoid potential abuse or its re-occurrence in home, communities and institutions. Examples of these interventions included those designed to improve the quality of care and living situations of older people and those designed to improve long-term care. Interventions included those which sought to increase detection of abuse, raised awareness of elder abuse amongst the public and professionals, provided victim support and delivered training for care providers. The researchers also sought to determine whether programmes of a greater intensity were more effective. Seven studies, four from the United States, one from Taiwan and two from the United Kingdom (all classed as high income countries) were included. A total of 1942 older participants and 740 other people (e.g., family carers and staff) were involved. Three studies focussed on education and prevention interventions for health care professionals and caregivers. One study aimed to improve the mental health of carers in order to reduce abuse in persons with dementia, and one study focussed on the detection of abuse compared with a control arm focused on preventing elder abuse. One offered a psychosocial group intervention to support victims of abuse and one examined a multi-agency/public health approach. There was some evidence of increased knowledge and improved attitudes to elder abuse; however, results were mixed, whether these strategies were successful in detecting and preventing elder abuse. Overall, there was uncertainty as to the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse due to the heterogeneity in the settings, measures and effects reported in the seven included studies. The teaching of coping skills appeared helpful to reduce anxiety and depression of family member carers, although it was unknown whether this led to less abuse. Interventions targeting re-occurrence may possibly result in a detrimental effect. Of the four interventions deemed as higher intensity, only one low quality study showed some effect. Review authors were unable to draw any firm conclusions as to the effects of elder abuse interventions on any of the main outcomes compared with control/standard care. The seven studies were of low methodological quality with only one study judged to have no domains at low risk of bias. Although raising awareness of elder abuse, it is unclear if educational interventions can aid detection and prevent elder abuse. Blending education and support for victims may improve reporting but the evidence was equivocal. The reviewers identified some potential for service planning interventions to improve awareness of the need for meticulous assessment and documentation of elder abuse. Teaching coping skills to family members of the elderly with dementia is a promising approach. Programmes need to be carefully evaluated, as there is a risk for inadvertent harm. The present evidence does not support the approach of simply doing more of a program, or more in combination. More research is required as the current evidence base offers little guidance for nurses as to the best approaches to prevent and detect elder abuse. The review identified forthcoming research, but even so, given the breadth of the definition of elder-abuse and possible strategies, the evidence remains scarce. Elder abuse is a societal problem which can take various forms, may be carried out by those whom older people are reliant on and can be invisible. The findings of this review suggest that education interventions may improve attitudes to elder abuse but there is little evidence that such interventions have a positive impact on the prevention or reduction of elder abuse. A significant challenge for nurses is that elder abuse may be carried out by people well known to the older person or colleagues. Therefore, nurses need to be alert to the possibilities of elder abuse and have a duty of care to investigate if they have concerns. Nurses in the community or institutional care provide care for older people. They are therefore well placed to be alert to the possibility of elder abuse. Building a relationship with the older person and their family alongside impeccable assessment is important. Given education and training has been shown to change attitudes such training is important and staff need to be aware of policies around elder abuse. From an organizational perspective, the knowledge that the pressures of inadequate resources also positively correlate with an increase in elder abuse should be considered in the management of organizational risk. Given that family members often struggle with caring for elderly people with dementia, teaching coping skills appears a promising approach. Each situation should be evaluated to ensure that the actions are not resulting in detrimental effects. Furthermore, this review highlights the need to consider not only the responsibilities of individuals and organizations but also that of wider society in preventing and tackling the issue of elder abuse. In the absence of robust research evidence, it is recommended that primary, secondary and tertiary interventions continue to be funded, provided and engaged with in order that they may be fully evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

Using a semi-structured questionnaire, seven men were interviewed with the goal of understanding how they have navigated Erikson's life stages. Significant results included: an early sense of being different and a period of time between \"coming out to self\" and \"coming out to another person,\" both complicating Erikson's sense of \"social trust.\" The men also described finding non-biological ways of achieving generativity as well as the development of a strong internal sense of authority or locus of control. Other strengths gained included: achieving a broad base of social support or a \"family of choice,\" and becoming role models themselves in response to a clear absence of positive role models during their own adolescence, which many identified as delaying their coming out. Finally, AIDS was discussed by many as a critical factor affecting how these men navigate each of Erikson's stages. Implications of these tentative findings are suggested for research, teaching, practice, and for psychosocial theory itself.",

      "abstract": "Masculine men are more likely to idealise being tall, muscular, and lean. Feminine men, on the other hand, are more likely to idealise leanness. At the trait level, masculinity and femininity have been linked with an unhealthy striving for these idealised traits and body dissatisfaction. However, it is unclear how feeling masculine or feminine in the moment might be associated with body satisfaction. Is feeling masculine and/or feminine associated with a boost in body satisfaction? In the first large-scale experience sampling study of masculinity and femininity (nobservations=25,133; Nparticipants=530), we find that state masculinity and femininity, but not trait, are associated with increased body satisfaction among sexual minority men. We also find a gender congruence effect whereby the positive associations between state masculinity/femininity on body satisfaction are more pronounced when these feelings align with trait levels of masculinity/femininity. Exploratory analyses revealed a moderating effect of eating disorder history. The associations between masculinity and femininity on body satisfaction were amplified for people who had been diagnosed with an eating disorder. This study presents the first evidence that the links between masculinity and femininity and body satisfaction can be delineated based on whether they are measured as traits or states.",

      "abstract": "Our society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal to perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do so. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people from practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have satisfied certain licensing requirements.\nThese general criteria for regulatory licensing can certainly be applied to parents. First, parenting is an activity potentially very harmful to children. The potential for harm is apparent: each year more than half a million children are physically abused or neglected by their parents. Many millions more are psychologically abused or neglected not given love, respect, or a sense of self-worth. The results of this maltreatment are obvious. Abused children bear the physical and psychological scars of maltreatment throughout their lives. Far too often they turn to crime. They are far more likely than others to abuse their own children. Even if these maltreated children never harm anyone, they will probably never be well-adjusted, happy adults. Therefore, parenting clearly satisfies the first criterion of activities subject to regulation.\nThis discussion is abhorrent and needs to be supplanted with a more child-centered view. Parents who hold this view may well maltreat their children. If these parents happen to treat their children well, it is only because they want to, not because they think their children deserve or have a right to good treatment. Moreover, this belief is manifestly at odds with the conviction that parents should prepare children for life as adults. Children subject to parents who perceive children in this way are likely to be adequately prepared for adulthood. Hence, to prepare children for life as adults and to protect them from maltreatment, this attitude toward children must be dislodged. As I have argued, licensing is a viable way to protect children. Furthermore, it would increase the likelihood that more children will be adequately prepared for life as adults than is now true.",

      "abstract": "FigureWelcome to The Sex Issue: A Guide to Patient Sexual Health Topics. The World Health Organization defines sexual health as “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality...not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity.” Many factors can influence patients' positive feelings about their sexuality, including age, culture, and relationships. Explore more about cultural impact by reading “The Influence of Mother-Daughter Connectedness on Sexual Activity” (page 36). For many of us, it can be uncomfortable to broach the subject of a patient's sexual history. However, assessing our patients' sexual health is vital to maintaining and optimizing their physiologic and psychosocial health. In “How to Take a Sexual Health History,” we discuss key points you need to know (page 6). Opening the dialogue about a patient's sexual health requires a confidential, respectful, accepting, and positive approach to sexuality and sexual relationships. Sexuality is diverse and unique to each individual patient. It's a way to convey love, affection, and intimacy that can positively impact the patient's physical, emotional, and social well-being. Learn about best practices for our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients and families in “A Center of Excellence Model for LGBT Patient Care” (page 15). A sexual health history includes the patient's past and current sexual practices, identifying at-risk behaviors, exposure to sexually transmitted infections, and any sexual dysfunction. Get the facts about a common vaginal infection in “Danger! Bacterial Vaginosis During Pregnancy” (page 28) and how hormonal imbalance can be a common cause of sexual dysfunction for men in “Get to Know ‘Low T’” (page 30). When taking a sexual health history, we provide a safe space for patients and their partners to ask questions about their sexual health. Our post-op patients may require sexual activity recommendations at discharge to reduce the risk of complications. We can offer proactive evidence-based practice recommendations to support the patient's sexual health. Read more about this in “Talking with Your Post-op Patients about Sex” (page 12). The sexual health history also allows us to identify patients who may be victims of sexual assault. We must be prepared to meet the physiologic and psychological needs of these patients as discussed in “Understanding Sexual Assault” (page 42). Our patients can experience varying degrees of sexual harassment in their school, work, and home environments. See how to respond in this issue's Ask an Expert: “Sexual Harassment in the Workplace” (page 55). Sexuality can be expressed throughout a patient's lifespan. “Sex and the Older Adult” (page 20) provides tips for helping older patients achieve optimal sexual health and intimacy. As patients age, they may experience dementia, which can cause them to exhibit sexual disinhibition. In “Sexually Inappropriate Behavior in Patients with Dementia” (page 51), you'll find intervention strategies. Providing our patients with an open forum to convey an accurate sexual health history throughout their lifespan helps us encourage physiologic, psychosocial, and sexual wellness. And that's what this special issue is all about!",

      "title": "MEN’S GENDER CAPITAL EXPERIENCES IN LATER LIFE",
      "abstract": "Over the last decade there have been substantial advances in understanding the gendered dimensions of ageing. Prior studies have mostly dealt with understanding the lives of older women while largely neglecting or omitting older men. The focus on women facing disadvantages in socio-economic and marital status has shifted to men’s post-work and health issues in the last few decades, and only recently to masculinities and gender capital in later life. Contemporary discussions on cultural and gender capital bring relevant recognition and somehow unintentionally reveal that gender can matter to the same extent or even more in old age than in childhood or adulthood. This article analyses the results of semi-structured in-depth interviews with 98 men aged 60 or more and other data collected in Slovenia as part of the Old Guys Erasmus+ project. The project results are in line with recent studies on gender capital and masculinities, and justify why older men should be seen, discussed and examined as individual agents who practice, perform and produce gender in later life too. They also explain why hegemonic masculinity is only one aspect of gendered life experiences and that different masculine realities stand alongside each other and are as necessary for men in later life as femininities are for women, particularly in contemporary societies where both aged men and women are seen and represented as de-gendered, un-gendered or even genderless.",

No contrary findings (indicating stronger sexual motivation among women) were found. Hence we conclude that the male sex drive is stronger than the female sex drive.

No differences were found with respect to depression, somatization, diet, or activity level. There was a significant interaction effect between race and living arrangement with respect to anxiety, with blacks being less anxious than whites when living with others, and more anxious when living alone or with only a spouse.",

Derogatory attitude in an individual may exist in a setting devoid of politically based racism and may have nothing to do with race. The more widespread issue of prejudice is an individual attitude which may invoke race, but is as likely to be related to some other 'stigma'-generating marker. In normal practice it is unusual to find evidence of discrimination consequent on prejudice in open every-day therapeutic contact between workers/therapists and patients. Attempts were made to interview patients through relatives, neighbours and hospital personnel involved in their management, and to this end a semi-structured interview form was used which included data on mental, social, psychological and material factors.",

At every phase of psychosexual development the repressing and inhibitory social forces, both parental and extrafamilial (such as church, school, legal, and local standards), tend to increase the pressures that compel conformance to frustrating and emotionally disturbing standards of sexual behavior. Frustration and inhibition is part and parcel of the socialization process, and restriction of the sexual urges of the child is therefore essential. It is generally recognized that a well-adjusted sex life is important for mental health; therefore, the physician who is interested in both the physical and the emotional well-being of his patients will direct their attention to this essential area of human life.

La informacion recolecto a traves de una serie de entrevistas gravadas a los sujetos en estudio (hombres entre 50 y 60 anos). Las categorias que surgieron de las primeras entrevistas, generaron nuevos interrogantes y nuevas aproximaciones que permitieron esclarecer dudas, determinar otras categorias, refinar las existentes o establecer otras para luego tomar las relevantes. Los entrevistados manifestaron conocer genesis de los cambios que producen durante andropausia y asi lo expresan: de ciertas hormonas, declinacion biologica. El conocer los cambios les permite percibirlos cuando presentan; se pierde urgencia para eyacular, demora en ereccion, el rendimiento sexual y potencialidad son menores, sentimos o queremos sentir menos que mujer en menopausia, pero hay una disminucion en interes Se conserva la capacidad el entusiasmo. Se gana mesura, espiritualidad, conocimiento mutuo, afectividad, tranquilidad. Por todo lo anterior puede afirmar que los cambios surgidos contraindican las expectativas del papel sexual asignado culturalmente al hombre y en oportunidades no esta preparado para afrontar situacion que generan los cambios biologicos. Este proceso permitio replantear a los hombres lo que hasta momento era su vida sexual, llevandolos a una plenitud sexual. Se establece ayer (la juventud) y hoy (la senectud). El ayer en donde solo pensaban en su disfrute, en poder tener mayor numero de eyaculaciones, en donde presentaba ansiedad por quedarle bien a pareja, urgencia por eyacular y hoy cuando hombre siente en declinar biologico y sexual, busca sacarle partido a otros aspectos de sexualidad, a los que durante juventud les resto importancia, como ternura, comunicacion, preocuparse ahora por disfrute y satisfaccion sexual de pareja.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is not a highly institutionalized position in American society.1 It is a transitional status between childhood and adulthood, but it is less institutionalized than either of the two age-based status positions that it borders and connects. The adolescent is a marginal person who is no longer accorded the privileged status of the child, nor as yet many of the rights and responsibilities of the adult. The relatively low degree of institutionalization of adolescence as a status position and the marginal position of the adolescent in terms of role expectations in American society are reflected in the fact that most of the norms governing adolescent behavior do not have adolescent behavior patterns as their reference point. Rather, the norms and expectations governing adolescent behavior have either child or adult behavior patterns as their reference point. The exhortations of parents and other adults admonish the adolescent either to like a grown-up or to quit behaving like a child.. They rarely encourage him to like an adolescent. There are, then, no highly institutionalized expectations of how one is to behave like an adolescent, in the sense that achievement of these status expectations is a positive transitional link with the adult status.",

      "abstract": "From a dynamic perspective, it is essential to search for links that may exist between the two disorders that affect this child. The attachment theory allows us to develop a hypothesis, based on the history of this boy and the clinical observations of the authors.\r\n\r\nThe affective deprivation of the first 16 months of life is indicated by the great difficulty with which the boy entered into a relationship with his adoptive parents. He obviously took a long time to accept his highly attentive adopted mother. This included an oppositional phase (so often observed in deprived children).that seemed to be intended to provoke maternal rejection. But why, during this slow relationship-forming process, did he flee from the male figure? Had he been abused by one or more males in his early childhood? If so, this could be the primary reason why he is inclined to adopt a female identity.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that the observed behaviour of the adoptive mother is influencing him to assume a female identity. One notes that his mother—in keeping with a process often observed in children thought to be traumatised and profoundly deprived—shows a tendency to put his needs before her own. She gave him an affectionate nickname that is typically given to females, and he demonstrates—even at the age of 6–7—a constant search for the approval of his adopted mother.\r\n\r\nIf the child has suffered trauma at the hands of a male figure, this overprotective behaviour by the adoptive mother might encourage the boy to imagine that, if he were a girl, he would receive all the affection he desired and missed during his first 16 months—a crucial period in self-development.",

      "title": "Courtship Display Persists Despite Early Social Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Early experience is known to be important in the development of mating behaviour. The behavioural and chemical stimuli obtained by observing adults interacting are thought to operate as template by which young acquire the ability to sexually display when appropriate. But, while the importance of early social interactions for the development of mating behaviour is well accepted, how social deprivation at different onto‐genetic phases contributes for this effect is poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by asking how social deprivation at different ontogenetic phases (before or after 6 wk) mediates male mating behaviour in the Trinidadian guppy. We show that in the absence of early social interaction, the latency of mating behaviour is briefly delayed, but that all individuals were able to sexually display in &lt;30 min. Interestingly, regardless of the timing of social deprivation, mating behaviour starts sooner under female‐biased sex ratios environments that than under a male‐biased sex ratio, suggesting that male sexual behaviour is driven by female cues. The short‐lived effects of social deprivation on mating behaviour reflect the extraordinary innate plasticity of guppies, which is likely to contribute to their success as invasive species.",

El envejecimiento es un proceso continuo, multidimensional y varía entre individuos debido a factores internos y externos, no solo se define por la edad cronológica, biológica o social, sino también por la experiencia subjetiva de cada persona. Los estereotipos sobre la vejez, que pueden ser positivos o negativos, en donde influyen en la percepción y experiencia del envejecimiento. Los estereotipos negativos, como la percepción de que las personas mayores son dependientes o inútiles, pueden reducir la satisfacción y la calidad de vida. La discriminación por edad (ageísmo) y las representaciones sociales negativas afectan la funcionalidad y participación social de las personas mayores. La investigación realizada en Matehuala, México, con una muestra intencionada de 30 personas de diferentes edades reveló que las percepciones sobre el envejecimiento varían con la edad. Los adultos mayores tienden a tener una visión más negativa sobre la vejez en comparación con los más jóvenes, quienes a menudo tienen expectativas irrealistas o no consideran la vejez en profundidad. Los resultados sugieren que una actitud positiva hacia el envejecimiento y el mantenimiento de hábitos saludables pueden mejorar la calidad de vida en la vejez. Mientras que el 70% de los encuestados considera que llevar un estilo de vida saludable es clave para un buen envejecimiento, el 30% también destaca la importancia de una mentalidad positiva y relaciones saludables. En conclusión, abordar el envejecimiento desde una perspectiva positiva, centrarse en la gratitud y mantener una actitud activa puede mejorar la salud y el bienestar en la vejez, y contrarrestar los efectos negativos de los estereotipos y la discriminación.",

      "abstract": "In the past 20 years a large number of studies have been made in order to investigate what is associated with the severity ofperimenopausal symptoms and large interindividual differences in their manifestation. Apart from studies of the biological determinants of perimenopausal symptoms, they have also examined the contribution of various psychosocial factors in their occurrence and severity. Although menopausal symptoms are primarily considered to be a result of the sometimes intense hormonal fluctuations that are experienced during perimenopause, this does not necessarily exclude the role of psychosocial factors such as demographic characteristics, cultural or ethnic background, attitudes toward menopause, specific lifestyles and habits, specific previous life experiences and personality traits. A review of recent research findings and contributions of these psychosocial factors in the development of perimenopausal symptoms engaged will be presented in this work. Studies have clearly shown that certain psychosocial factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of symptoms or increased risk for perimenopausal symptoms, including the risk for major disturbances, such as clinical depression.",

      "title": "Three-Year-Old Children Detect Social Exclusion in Third-Party Interactions",
      "abstract": "Humans are motivated to connect with others and are sensitive to social exclusion—intentionally leaving out others. This ability to detect social exclusion is suggested to be evolutionarily adaptive, biologically hardwired, and an important feature of social-cognitive development. Yet it is unclear when children start to independently detect social exclusion. Previous developmental research on social exclusion has focused on children older than 4 years of age, but recent infancy research has suggested younger children may be able to process complex social interactions such as social exclusion. The present study is the first to examine whether 2- to 3-year-old children detect social exclusion and if they prefer to affiliate with individuals who have been excluded over individuals who exclude others. Across 2 experiments, 2- and 3-year-old children (N = 140) viewed exclusive group interactions, in which 2 agents unjustly excluded 1 agent, and children were asked to choose whether they preferred to play with an excluded agent or an exclusive agent. Three-year-old children consistently preferred to play with the excluded agent, whereas 2-year-old children showed no preference. Three-year-old children did not show a preference among agents engaged in inclusive interactions and did not prefer an agent who refused to engage with a group, showing that 3-year-old children distinguish unjust exclusion from other types of interactions. Together, these findings suggest 3-year-old children detect social exclusion and are motivated to affiliate with unjustly excluded agents over those who exclude others, whereas these capacities are still developing in 2-year-old children.",

      "abstract": "La menstruación es un proceso biológico e involuntario vivenciado por mujeres cis, varones trans, personas no binarias y algunas personas de determinados espectros de la intersexualidad por aproximadamente cuarenta años. Se constituye también como un fenómeno histórico-social susceptible a elementos culturales que influyen en la forma en que se construyen las representaciones sociales que se elaboran sobre ella. Dichas representaciones no son ajenas al impacto de las marcas androcéntricas y el orden cisheteropatriarcal que ha permeado desde la cotidianidad hasta la producción de conocimiento científico. Lo anterior conlleva a que hayan prevalecido representaciones negativas de la sangre menstrual vinculadas a crisis de higiene, efectos negativos, cambios emocionales, estigmatización, ocultamiento, tabú, entre otros. No obstante, en las últimas décadas, epistemologías otras han permitido el surgimiento y la visibilización de narrativas y lenguajes que han facilitado no solo la elaboración de representaciones más positivas y críticas, sino también la comprensión de la menstruación como un fenómeno que no solo es vivido por las mujeres. Por tal motivo, en el presente artículo se pretende realizar una breve revisión de las marcas androcéntricas encontradas en algunas disciplinas científicas y en la sociedad en sí misma. Asimismo, busca resaltar las nuevas perspectivas como formas de resistencia epistémica y las herramientas, como las epistemologías feministas, que pueden marcar un camino en la re-apropiación de la menstruación por parte de quienes la viven.",

We also revisited the importance of various positive traits in a potential partner. The participants (N = 1,017) played a date-simulation game. They chose which one of five positive characteristics, and which one of three disgust norm transgressions they want to manifest. We analysed the influence of one's biological sex, sexual orientation, and culture on self-presentation during a date. Women more often manifested morally disgusting behaviours and artistic abilities than men, while men more often manifested pathogenically disgusting behaviours and kindness. Homosexual orientation predicted lower frequency of admitting to moral disgust transgressions, and higher frequency of exhibiting artistic abilities.",

      "title": "Tall Stature",
      "abstract": "Tall stature is rarely pathologic, but the pediatric health care clinician must be able to distinguish familial causes from those due to endocrine or genetic reasons. Defined as a height 2 SDs above the mean for age and sex or greater than the 95th percentile, tall stature is usually familial or secondary to obesity. Although there is known psychological stigma associated with short stature, the paucity of evidence that tall stature in females or males is psychologically detrimental makes the previous practice of sex hormone administration to decrease ultimate adult height no longer acceptable.When evaluating tall stature, it is first necessary to plot serial height measurements during multiple visits. If these measurements confirm the criteria for tall stature, the clinician should calculate the child’s projected adult height by calculating the midparental height as follows:Parental heights should be measured directly because self-reported heights are often overestimated, especially in men. If a child has at least one tall parent and plots within 5 cm of the target adult height range, he/she is considered to have familial, or constitutional, tall stature. In this circumstance, no further investigation is warranted as long as the child is developing normally and has normal physical examination findings. Measurement of body proportions is also important, including upper body to lower body ratios and arm span, because these measures can help differentiate between pathologic and familial tall stature. At birth, the upper extremity to lower extremity ratio should be 1.7. By early childhood, this proportion should be 0.89 to 0.95. In addition, a child’s arm span is generally 1 cm shorter than his height, whereas an adolescent’s arm span is generally equal to his height. Klinefelter syndrome should be considered in a patient with tall stature, increased arm span, sparse hair, small testes, and a high-pitched voice, predicating the need for karyotype testing. A tall patient with decreased upper to lower body segment ratio, hyperextensible joints, and scoliosis may have Marfan syndrome.If pathologic tall stature is suspected, a bone age radiograph of left hand, fingers, and wrist should be ordered. A normal bone age is consistent with familial tall stature, whereas accelerated bone age in a nonobese child must lead the pediatrician to consider precocious puberty or growth hormone excess. Obesity leads to tall stature in childhood with a normal final adult height and is associated with accelerated skeletal maturation. Although the exact mechanism for obesity’s role in tall stature is not understood, the hormone ghrelin, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, insulin-like growth factors, and insulin all have the potential to mediate linear growth.In conjunction with bone age, precocious puberty can be diagnosed with Tanner staging and assessing testicular volume in males, with a postpubertal testicular volume being greater than 4 mL. Patients with late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia present with precocious puberty, tall stature, and an increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone level in the blood. Growth hormone excess is rare in children, yet when present is usually due to pituitary adenomas. Growth hormone excess before epiphyseal fusion results in tall stature and markedly increased height velocity. If it occurs after epiphyseal fusion, adolescents may also have signs of acromegaly, such as coarsening of facial features, enlarged jaw, and distal body overgrowth, including large hands and feet.There are other rare genetic syndromes associated with tall stature, all of which have significant clinical stigmata that should be apparent on physical examination. Sotos syndrome should be considered if the bone age is accelerated and the child has accompanying symptoms of facial flushing, frontal bossing, and a narrow face and head. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is considered if hypoglycemia is present at birth, along with anterior abdominal wall defects and macroglossia. Marshall-Smith syndrome is associated with unusually rapid physical growth, abnormal facies, and respiratory issues.A pediatric health care professional can diagnose most causes of tall stature with a careful history and physical examination. If suspicion is high for disease or the cause is unclear, the clinician should consider radiographic bone age and focused laboratory testing. Although the social stigma behind tall stature has decreased, clinicians must still be aware of potential pathologic causes of tall stature that would warrant intervention.Comments: This In Brief emphasizes the importance of accurate height measurements. My experience is that height measurement can often be inaccurate, especially in supine measurements in young children or very active children who have difficulty standing still. When transitioning from supine measurements to standing measurements in toddlers, there may appear to be a false perception of a decrease in height because standing height is often shorter than supine length. Accurate measurement of upper to lower body segment ratios is important in identifying several syndromes and can be performed in the following way. To measure lower body segment, measure from the symphysis pubis of the patient to the floor. The upper segment can be calculated by subtracting the lower segment from the total height. Measurement of arm span is best accomplished by measuring from the tip of the middle finger of one hand, with arms outstretched at a 90° angle to the tip of the middle finger of the other hand.A recent study of self-reported adult height measurements in parents found that men have a tendency to overestimate their heights but women’s self-report is more accurate. When looking at estimating the other parent’s height, women were more likely to overestimate the men’s height, whereas men were more accurate in estimating women’s height. Their conclusions were that attempts should be made to use measured heights of parents when the results would have an effect on diagnostic workup or treatment of patients with tall stature.",

      "title": "Sexuality and contraception.",
      "abstract": "Peoples sexuality and contraceptive needs are examined at 2 important periods of life -- adolescence and middle age. Human sexuality as much psychological as it is physical involves the mind and the body. Contraceptive and sexuality must be linked. When choosing methods of contraception couples must consider the facts and select what appeals to them in view of their needs fertility moral or religious habits and their cultural and individual attitudes towards sexual relationships and male and female roles. Another important principle is that the contraceptive needs of a person will vary throughout his/her life. With physical and psychological maturity occurring progressively earlier and the age of marriage becoming later it is inevitable that an increasing number of adolescents experiment with sex or have sexual relations outside marriage. The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) implies a premeditated intention to be sexually involved which many young women do not have as well as the ability and motivation to take pills regularly. The insertion of an IUD reduces the problem of poor motivation but the complication rates tend to be increased in young nulliparae which requires followup visits. 1 problem with the diaphragm is that nulliparous teenagers frequently find the procedure of fitting a diaphragm rather offputting. It also requires preparation for each act of intercourse. Condoms appear particularly suitable for unmarried teenagers because their use does not require any preparation or long-term planning and they are available from many retail outlets. Postcoital contraception is of use after a single episode of unprotected midcycle intercourse. The sexual potential of the human female is at its greatest between the ages of 35-45. By the time women reach the 40-45 year age group the fertility rate drops by more than 1/2. Barrier methods which are related specifically to each act of intercourse are particularly suitable for the older couple. The IUD requires no daily motivation and gives an overall failure rate of 3-5 pregnancies/100 women years. This is lower among older women. Many older women who have completed their families and want to stop taking the OC seek sterilization as the best method of fertility control.",

      "title": "S10: Ageism in intersection: Ensuring the human rights of older persons in the face of oppressions",
      "abstract": "Summary: Ageism is defined as prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes towards people because of their age. Ageism can be directed towards individuals of all ages and be either positive or negative. Ageism can operate at the institutional level directed via legal and social policies, at the meso level as evident in interpersonal relations and at the micro level directed by people towards their own age and aging. Ageism can be experienced either consciously with full awareness or unconsciously, without the agent of ageism and/or the target of ageism being fully aware of it. The following presentations will address ageism in relation to older persons because of its well- known detrimental effects. An important aspect of ageism concerns the fact that it does not occur in silo. Instead, it is often age in intersection with other forms of discrimination, which results in the marginalization of older persons. Perel-Levin will analyse how ageism and age-based discrimination intersect with other forms of biases, discrimination, and inequalities based, such as disability, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The presentation by Daichman will focus on age in intersection with gender by stressing the vulnerable place of older women and relate this to elder abuse. Ayalon will highlight self- directed ageism and intergenerational conflict as they manifest in older persons’ political activism. Finally, Rabheru will discuss findings concerning ageism in Canada based on data obtained from a diverse array of stakeholders, including researchers, healthcare professionals, social service providers, older persons, and advocates. Kalache will moderate the session and conclude with applied tools to ensure the human rights of older persons in the face of institutional, interactional, and intrapersonalageism.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for management of sexual disorders in elderly",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sexuality is an important component of emotional and physical intimacy that most men and women desire to experience throughout their lives. Although it is a fundamental driving force, human sexuality is frequently misunderstood. Even among clinicians who acknowledge the relevance of addressing sexual issues in their patients, there is a general lack of understanding of the optimal approach for sexual problem identification and evaluation. In line with the worldwide trend the number of older adults is notable and is growing in India. The latest data by the Ministry of Statistics and programme implementation in 2016 shows that India has a total of 103.6 million elderly and their population has risen from 5.6% to 8.6% in the last 5 decades, thus this topic which is frequently neglected in the elderly takes on particular importance. Sexual life continues to be important in later life and the elder often view sexuality as an expression of passion, affection, admiration and loyalty. Sexual activity is a means for elder to affirm physical functioning, to maintain a strong sense of identity and establish self-confidence. Studies show that sexual desire does not change with older age and it is important for both men and women. Even in elderly women after menopause, the sexual ability does not completely disappear but it is affected by sexual dysfunction, either in oneself or in the partner. Sexual functioning is a complex combination of bio-psycho-social process which is coordinated by neurological, vascular and endocrine systems and any approach to the study of human sexuality that stresses only in one dimension is counter-productive. Recent studies suggest sexual functioning are influenced by factors representing three domains: biologic (the drive), psychological (the will), social context (the wish), and interactions between them. Sexual function and activity are closely linked with physical health, hence understanding sexual function in the later life course is important from a medical standpoint. Poor sexual function can be due to an underlying serious health condition. For example, it has been found that erectile dysfunction in men may be a marker for asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Diabetes mellitus, which has vascular effects on blood vessels, is one of the most frequent systemic disorders associated with low sexual desire and other sexual problems in aging men whereas diabetic neuropathy can cause impaired sexual desire in women. Understanding the sexual behaviour may uncover protective health effects. Laumann and colleagues discovered an association between sexual well-being and happiness. Numerous prescription drugs have adverse effects on sexual functioning including antidepressants especially SSRI's (causing anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido) and antihypertensives (Diuretics, calcium channel blockers). Moreover adverse drug effects are reported much more frequently in the aging population than in the general population. The use of prescribed medications and the rate of adverse effects of drug therapy are consistently higher in female than male elderly populations and they influence sexual responses including desire by non-specific effects on general well-being, energy levels and mood. Psychological factors (the will) are major determinants of intensity of sexual desire. Psychological factors are independently related to sexual functioning. In addition emotional and interpersonal motivation mediates the effect of sexual drive which is characterized by willingness of person to behave sexually with a given partner and can compensate for diminished physiologic desire of sexual activity (eg as result of declining testosterone levels). Psychological condition such as depression is a risk factor for sexual dysfunction along with the medications associated with treating it. Social context (the wish) also plays a crucial role in sexual function- a role that has been neglected in medical literature. For e.g availability of a partner, intimate communication, relationship duration, characteristics of an individual's sexual partner and cultural experiences. Furthermore, Laumann et al. discovered in their analyses of the Global Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviours that association among subjective sexual wellbeing and physical health, mental health, sexual practices, and relationship context were consistent in a broad variety of countries from each major world region. In addition, the authors found that men reported higher levels of subjective sexual well-being regardless of sociocultural context. They also established an overall correlation between subjective sexual well-being and happiness in men and women. Despite the importance of sexual function sexual problems are highly prevalent yet frequently under-recognized and under diagnosed in clinical practice. Adequate attention to these aspects during the history taking will educate the patients regarding the complex nature of sexuality, and prepare them in understanding treatment and outcome realities. The rational selection of therapy by patients is only possible following appropriate education, including information about sexuality and all treatment options for sexual dysfunction. Although not always possible on the first visit, every effort should be made to involve the patient's sexual partner early in the therapeutic process. There are many myths (Table 1) prevailing in the society and the treating physician and collaborating specialist should possess broad knowledge about human sexuality.Table 1: Myths associated with Elderly Sexuality11Psychosocial factors affecting sexuality in Elderly Marriage; For woman availability of a sexually willing, capable and socially sanctioned sexual partner appears to be the most important factor, but problems arise as women usually outlive men. Marital status appears to be less important in men regarding sexual activity. As society is moving from double standards for men and woman these differences are narrowing. More and more older people cohabit to avoid social insecurity; therefore one should not assume older unmarried people are sexually inactive. Extramarital issues should also be kept in mind. Families; Many traditional and joint families, particularly in rural areas fail to provide privacy to the elderly, young newly married occupying the private space. Families who do not accept the sexual needs of divorced or widowed elderly contribute to the negative feelings of the elderly about themselves. Medical and nursing staffs tendency to be judgmental about sexual needs of the elderly patients, gives the impression that this is abnormal. Total care of elderly should encompass addressing sexual feeling and the need for privacy. Remarriage; Remarriage in late life may be even more satisfying than first marriage. Remarriage is often threatening for grown up children who throw storm of protest. Remarriage should be encouraged as loneliness may lead to despair. Sexuality, Education & Awareness; Education usually removes sexual inhibition and unnecessary anxiety, and enhances communication. Only education can give the right attitude regarding sexuality in elderly who are widowed, divorced or cohabiting. Disparity in desire Disparity in desire among couples may increase over years; difficulties arise when one is content with holding hands and the other partner has strong sexual urges. Sexual interest Individuals who enjoyed sex in younger years continue sexual interest when they grow older and remain sexually active in later years. Couples tend to become less inhibited and feel free to explore varying type of sexual stimulation as age advances. Regular sexual expression Regular sexual expression is important, especially for women. Lack of regular sexual expression and privacy correlates with a decrease interest in coitus. Family climacteric; Faulty attitude to \"change in life\" may affect the couples response if they consider that it implies a change of status and the level of attractiveness, and the sexual activity is inappropriate. Women may suffer from empty nest syndrome or boredom, and have little status of their own. They may have difficulty in re-entering the profession of their own, or picking up the threads of their own lives once their children have left home. Women may link sexual capacity to maternal capacity, and loss of reproductive capacity may be difficult for some to accept, depending on what fertility has meant, and whether they have had as many, too many or too few children compared to what they wanted. Problems faced during pregnancy, infertility and contraception also have an impact. A small number of men over 60 years also experience a syndrome called male climacteric. This is characterized by four or more of the following symptoms; listlessness, weight loss, poor appetite, depressed libido, loss of erectile potency, impaired ability to concentrate, weakness, easy fatigability and irritability. The differentiating and deciding factor is level of testosterone. HORMONES Decrease in testosterone concentrations (normal 270-1100 ng/dl) are noted from the age of 50 years, at the rate of 100 ng/dl per decade and the sensitivity of androgen receptors decreases in men with age; however healthy aging men never become hypogonadal. Testosterone levels in saliva of heterosexual adolescent men correlate positively with the number of times they initiated sexual contact (although whether sexual contact led to the increase in androgens needs to be confirmed). In both men and women, orgasm (induced by masturbation) increases sympathetic activation leading to an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline levels (transiently) an increase in plasma prolactin level for 30 min in men and 60 min in women. In women, sexual arousal increases plasma luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels. The neurohormone oxytocin is also released during orgasm and reinforces pleasure.ILL HEALTHEFFECTS OF AGEING ON SEXUAL RESPONSE CYCLE The capacity to respond to sexual stimulation is effectively retained, although the intensity of physical reaction is slowly reduced in all phases of sexual response cycle. Table 2 mentions the changes in sexual response seen with aging.Table 2: Changes in sexual response with agingSexual Problems: Classification and Epidemiology The 'Sexual Response Cycle' was described first by Masters and Johnson in 1966 as the EPOR Model (Excitement, Plateau, Orgasmic and Resolution phases) and later modified by Kaplan in 1974 into the DEOR model (Desire, Excitement, Orgasmic and Resolution phases), which became the accepted model universally. Classically, sexual inadequacy refers to some specific disruption of the 'Sexual Response Cycle' (as described by Masters and Johnson in 1970). The clinicians initially faced the difficulty of ascertaining the threshold for sexual disorders. This difficulty was overcome by adopting a patient centered approach. Accordingly, a sexual problem is said to be present when an individual comes with difficulty in particular area of sexual functioning which may or may not be associated with behavioral, mood or cognitive symptoms. As per the DEOR model \"Sexual dysfunction is referred to aproblem during any phase of the sexual response cycle that prevents the individual or couple from experiencing satisfaction from the sexual activity\". Gender identity disorders and paraphilias should be differentiated from sexual inadequacies. 'Sex' is most commonly referred to as what an individual is biologically, whereas 'gender' is what one becomes in the social context. DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition) released in May 2013 defines Sexual Dysfunctions as \"a heterogeneous group of disorders that are typically characterized by a clinically significant 'disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually or to sexual pleasure\" Subtypes can be classified as Lifelong vs acquired and generalized vs situational. Other factors which may influence the symptom presentation include i) Partner's and individual vulnerability factors ii) Relationship issues iii) Psychiatric comorbidity iv) Cultural and v) General medical factors. Common Sexual Problems and Dysfunctions Classification in psychiatry has been a topic of debate and complex area of research. Some are of the opinion that classificatory system creates artificial boundaries between different category of problems; one the best examples for the same is merging of female sexual desire disorders and arousal disorders in DSM-5. Due to its eclectic approach the International classification of mental disorders (ICD-10) has been clinically acceptable in India. The DSM classificatory system by the American Psychiatric Society has been acceptable in academic institutions due to its pointwise approach. DSM 5 highlights the fact that clinical judgement needs to be applied to ascertain whether the sexual dysfunction is due to inadequate stimulation. DSM-5 subtypes include, lifelong which denotes that the problem has been present from the very beginning; acquired denotes that the problem started after a period of normal sexual functioning. Generalized (vs Situational) denotes that the sexual problem is present with all types of stimulation, all situations and partners. Other factors which need to be considered include: 1)Partner factors (sexual problems in the partner),2) Relationship factors, 3) Individual vulnerability factors (poor body image), 4) Cultural or religious factors, 5) Medical factors. As per DSM 5, if the sexual problem is due to a non -sexual mental disorder (anxiety, depression), substance use, other medical condition or severe relationship distress then a sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made.Table 3 gives a comparison of sexual dysfunctions mentioned in DSM 5 and ICD 10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders (International Classification of diseases10th Revision) Table 4 gives a brief description of sexual dysfunctions mentioned in DSM 5.Table 3: Comparison of diagnostic categories of ICD.10 & DSM-5 of sexual disorders9Table 4: Brief description of sexual dysfunctions mentioned in DSM 5Sexual Dysfunctions: Epidemiology The frequency of reporting and seeking help for sexual problems varies due to a number of factors like availability of sexual health care facility, awareness about the problem and the social and cultural factors. Geriatric sexuality literature constitutes only 0.5 % of the total publications, and still very few from the developing world. Logistical issues, sexuality specific venues competing for publication and geriatric journals avoiding sexuality related topics in elderly, contributes to low research volume on geriatric sexuality. Studies involving both the genders in the age group more than 50 years, reports prevalence of sexual dysfunction to be around 50-80%. Studies involving females in the age group of 50-70 years, reports prevelance of sexual dysfunction to be around 50-75%. Sexual Dysfunctions: Etiology Human sexual response is a complex biological phenomenon and is strongly influenced by interpersonal and socio-cultural factors. Generally speaking, sexual dysfunctions are multi-factorial in etiology. As mentioned, DSM-5 highlights the point that a sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made if the problem is better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, stressor, substance use or a general medical condition. Table 5 highlights the etiology of sexual disorders, whereas Table 6 and 7 mention the drugs most commonly associated with sexual dysfunction in the elderly male and female.Table 5: Etiology of sexual disordersTable 6: Common Drugs associated with male sexual dysfunction and alternative safer drugs availableMANAGEMENT OF SEXUAL INADEQUACIES Diagnostic workup As in all psychiatric interviews one needs to develop rapport in an accepting atmosphere with a non-judgmental attitude. Sexual history needs to be more structured, though areas of concern for the patient should be explored positively. Both recent and early sexual histories need to be noted. The current sexual complaints, life stresses, sexual practices, contraceptive use, partners, relationship problems, sexual fantasies, masturbatory history, extramarital affairs and commitment to partner should be enquired into. If married courtship period, honeymoon and reproductive history should be looked into. Mutual physical attraction, temporary separation and the effect of children on couple's sexual life should be noted. Changes in sexual functioning and frequency and quality of sexual interactions with age should be detailed. The partner's contribution to the present distress, life style factors, psychiatric history including history of substance abuse should be ascertained. The patient's self-image as a sexual being through childhood and adolescence and people who contributed to patient's sexual education and identity needs to be detailed. Any history of group sex, homosexual encounters and abortions should be considered and enquired. Sexual orientation of the patient, any high risk sexual behaviour and sexual abuse history should be kept in mind. Regardless of sexual orientation, each phase of the sexual response cycle applies equally to both heterosexual and homosexual partners and methods and principles of treatment are similar.Table 8 highlights the points to be considered for taking a sexual history; whereas table 9 describes the assessment of current sexual functioning in males and females.Table 8: Taking a Sexual History53Table 9: Assessment of current sexual functioning in males and femalesCareful history taking should be followed by a physical examination in all the cases after obtaining consent and maintaining privacy. Rule out organic disease and make a note of any contributing general medical illness. Laboratory studies include urine analysis, complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, ECG, thyroid function. Other endocrinal tests and Lab tests related to general medical illness if any or only when needed. Nocturnal penile tumescence, Intracavernosalinjection using avasodilating agent like papaverine, duplex color ultrasonography, dynamic infusioncavernosometry and cavernosography, pelvic penile angiography are the other tests in some selected cases and depends on what procedure is being planned. It is necessary to understand relationship difficulties among the couple, whether partner is sympathetic or not sympathetic towards the problem, their expectation and motivation for treatment. Differentiating features between organic and psychogenic sexual dysfunction need to be established well before the active management as mentioned in table 10.Table 10: Differentiating features between organic and psychogenic sexual dysfunction9PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION Sex therapy as it is referred to today is essentially a modified form of the original therapy (as founded by Masters and Johnson in 1970) and follows a brief, problem focused, and behavioral approach. Based on classic psychodynamic theories, resolution of early developmental conflicts, acceptance of sexual impulses to the ego and resolution of the problem was the main focus. The 'new' sex therapy focuses on relief of immediate symptoms and acts as a bridge between the psychoanalytic and behavioral approaches. Psychodynamic approaches are only used if the initial behavioral techniques do not produce symptom relief. As elaborated by Masters and Johnson in 1970, sex therapy (dual sex therapy) ideally includes involvement of both the partners. Anatomy and physiology of sexual function are explained in brief and doubts are cleared. Therapy emphasizes that there is no use blaming one's partner or oneself, and sex is a mutual act between two individuals. Interpersonal communication at a highly intimate level and enhanced social communication benefits the relationship. Education, heightening sensory awareness and sensate focus exercises are taught to the couple. Behavioral exercises include sensate focus (non-demand pleasuring), to allow the individual to re-experience pleasure without any pressure of performance or self-monitoring. The assessment and treatment need to be tailored depending upon one's setting, profession, specialty and most important of all, the type of the problem encountered in the client, wherein different approaches may be helpful.FigurePHARMACOTHERAPY FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION Nitric oxide enhancers: These drugs improve inflow of blood into the penis and improve erection. First drug developed in this class was sildenafil citrate. It acts on the nitric oxide mechanism by blocking PDE - 5 (Phosphodiesterase-5) enzyme. It is the first approved non-surgical treatment for erectile dysfunction and was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) in 1998 for prescription sale. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and has to be taken one hour before sexual activity which is the time required for peak plasma concentrations to be reached and the effect may last for upto 4 hours. The starting dose should be used on atleast four occasions to precisely access the efficacy and tolerability. If a satisfactory sexual performance is not achieved, the dose should be increased to the next higher level. Studies have clearly demonstrated that there is a dose-response curve with sildenafil and the best results are obtained upto a maximum dose of 100mg. However sildenafil has been used as a salvage therapy for severe erectile dysfunction at a maximum dose of 200 mg, but the incidence of side effects and discontinuation rates increase considerably. Very recent studies have reported that sildenafil does not worsen the cardiac profile of patients with Ischaemic heart disease, undergoing stress exercises. Sildenafil increases the time to developing symptoms of angina in symptomatic patients with Ischaemic heart diseaseundergoing a treadmill test. Sildenafil does not cause coronary steal or reflex tachycardia. For patients who experience an acute myocardial ischemia and who have taken sildenafil in the last 24 hours, administration of nitrates should be avoided. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have published recommendations for the use of sildenafil in patients with cardiac risk. Sildenafil should be used with caution in individuals maintained on multiple antihypertensive drugs. Adverse effects with sildenafil are dose dependent. Common adverse effects are headache (most common), flushing, rhinitis and visual disturbance changes in the perception of colour, hue or brightness. The adverse effects are usually mild and transient, lasting a few minutes to a few hours after drug administration. It is contraindicated in patients on concurrent organic nitrates. This is because it potentiates the hypotensive action of such drugs through its effects on nitric oxide/c-GMP mechanisms. It should be used with caution in persons with anatomical deformities of the penis (e.g. Angulation, Cavernosal fibrosis, Peyronie's disease), and in patients at risk for Priapism (e.gpatients with Sickle Cell anemia, Multiple Myeloma, Leukemia, Bleeding Disorders, Retinitis Pigmentosa). Rare side effect reported is Nonarteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Recent studies have reported that metformin and pioglitazone used in diabetes enhance the effect of Sildenafil in treating ED. Various PDE-5 inhibitors have been compared in table 11. A long acting PDE5 inhibitor should be considered for elderly men who frequently have sexual intercourse in the morning after waking up and patients who anticipate frequent sexual intercourse. Udenafil has clinical properties of both relatively rapid onset and long duration of action though it is not available in India.Table 11: COMPARISON OF PDE-5 INHIBITORS9PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION KEY POINTSOral Phentolamine and Apomorphine are helpful as potency enhancers in minimal erectile dysfunction. Apomorphine effects are mediated through the autonomic nervous system causing arterial vasodilation and has dopamine receptor stimulating effect. Phentolamine decreases sympathetic stimulation and relaxes corporeal smooth muscle. Smooth Muscle relaxants like Papaverine, Phentolamine, Phenoxybenzamine are used in ICIVAD (Intracavernosal injection of vasoactive drugs) techniques for ED; Prostaglandin E (Alprostadil) through injection or through intraurethral insertion is an effective agent for ED; to improve erectile function in animal studies and is likely to be studied on humans 52 in near future. A topical cream containing 3 vasoactive agents: Aminophylline, Isosorbidedinitrate and Co-dergocrinemesylate with or without Alprostadil is helpful in ED. An Alprostadil cream and vaginally applied Phentolamine are helpful for female sexual arousal disorder. Yohimbine is a central Alpha 2 adrenoreceptor blocker and increases sympathetic drive. Its effectiveness is doubtful in ED. Horny Goat weed (Epimedium) has been used as a traditional remedy for ED in China. Trazodone, an antidepressant acts by inhibiting serotonin uptake and also by influencing alpha adrenergic and dopaminergic function. Results are inconsistent in erectile disorders. Pharmacotherapy of premature ejaculation includes judicious use of tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs and certain topical therapies. Hormonal therapies: Testosterone is definitively effective only in case of hypogonadism. It can increase the desire but has no effect on erectile functioning. Female low sex drive and anorgasmia can be tried under careful monitoring. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) with estrogen in case of menopausal women as vaginal function, particularly lubrication is determined by them. Hyperprolactinaemia is treated by administration of dopaminergic drugs like bromocriptine. Other drugs: Naltrexone, an opiate antagonist, can antagonize the inhibition of sexual functions. Aswagandha, Shathavari, Korean red ginseng are helpful in enhancing sexual functioning in both males and females. Aswagandha (Indian ginseng) enhances sexual desire in men. Shathavari(Asparagus racemosus), a creeper which grows in low jungle areas throughout India is considered to be the women's equivalent to Ashwagandha and enhances female sexual functioning. Some of the traditional herbal medicines used in medieval Persia, have been shown to be helpful in ED by relatively recent research. These include ginger (Zingiberofficinale), almond (Amygdaluscommunis), spice commonly known as 'grains of paradise; Melegueta pepper' (Aframomummelegueta), and certain brassica species and seed of garden cress (Lepidium sp). Saffron (30 mg/day) has been shown to improve sexual function (arousal, lubrication and pain domain) in females with SSRI induced sexual dysfunction. Snacking on pistachio nuts, 100 gm/day for 3 weeks, has been shown to improve erectile dysfunction. Flibanserin (Trade name-Addyi; now available in India by the name Fliban by Hindustan Unilever) is a medication approved by US-FDA for the treatment of pre-menopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). In some selected cases when psychotherapy, behaviour techniques and drugs fail or seen to be not very effective, vacuum devises, injections and implants, vibrators are found to be relatively effective. Ultimately, the success of sex therapy depends on a host of factors. Therapy duration ranges from 6 weeks to more than a year in occasional cases. Sexual dysfunctions respond to treatment better compared to gender identify disorders and paraphilias, which are very resistant to therapy. More than half of the cases of erectile dysfunction and almost all the cases of premature ejaculation respond to combination of therapies. Gender Identity disorder / Gender Dysphoria Although much has been written on diagnosis of gender dysphoria, emphasis has always been on younger individuals. While several researchers have alluded to the problems of the aging gender dysphoric patient the relationship between diagnosis and treatment has been neglected. As more older gender dysphoric patients request sex-reassignment surgery, there will be increasing demands for differential diagnoses and treatment strategies. Correct diagnosis is especially crucial since life stresses may lead some transvestites to clinically present as transsexuals desiring sex-reassignment surgery. Sexual Variations, Paraphilia and Paraphilic Disorders Sexual variations are very common in almost all age groups and elderly are no exception. The term 'deviation' refers to the existence of a norm and the deviation takes place. In sexuality no such norm exists, as standard varies from time to time, place to place and epoch to epoch and culture to culture. Homosexuality has gradually come to be considered as a variation of sexual activity rather than deviation. However, one may encounter issues related to them in the Indian context in the elderly and there is need to attend to them with utmost sensitivity. The term paraphilia denotes a persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation with phenotypically normal, mature and consenting human partners. These may include the person's erotic activities or targets. Previously considered perversions implying sexually arousing fantasies, activities and gratification other than by willing genital intercourse between partners and a departure from the cultural norm. Normal sexual relationship implies activities which are acceptable and pleasurable to both the partners without the degradation, exploitation or distress to either of them. Contrary to the long held belief many paraphilic behaviours are predominantly male, does not involve offences and practices remain intensely private. DSM 5 recognizes and differentiates innocuous paraphilic behaviours from paraphilic disorders. A paraphilic disorder is a paraphilia causing distress to the individual with or without risk of harm to self or others. Example persistent interest in whipping or strangulating another person. A paraphilia is a necessary but not the only condition for diagnosing a paraphilic disorder. Among elderly they may represent some other primary cause and ruling out dementia, mood disorders and personality disorders is a must. Sexually inappropriate conduct often accompanies the disinhibition associated with dementia and neuropsychologic deficits. A detailed evaluation is mandatory. The treatment involves medications, behaviour modification therapies, family and psychotherapy and where necessary sex therapy like reinforcement of socially acceptable sexual function and management of erectile and ejaculatory impairment. CONCLUSION Conclusions: A. Quality of Life Aging typically entails some degree of change in men's and women's capacities for sexual performance from strictly physiological standpoint, yet research data suggests that an equalnumber of people in late life find sex satisfying, if not more so, than in their youth. It is important to recognize that older people are at risk of severalhealth-related, psychosocial, environmental circumstances that can hinder sexual expression and functioning. Although some of these barriers cannot be prevented entirely, education, advocacy andeffective coping strategies can soften their impact considerably. An understanding of the sexual changes that accompany normalaging may help physicians give patients realistic and encouragingadvice on sexuality. It is important that older men and women do not fall into the psychosocial trap of expecting (or worse, trying to force) the kind and degree of sexual response characteristic of their youth, it is equally as important that they not fall prey to the negative folklore according to which decreased physical intimacy is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time. Early adoption of healthy lifestyles may be the best approach to reducing the burden of erectile and other sexual dysfunctions on the health and well being of elderly. B. Sexual Rights Sexual rights embrace human rights that are already recognized in international human rights documents and other consensus statements and they include the rights of all persons, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, to the highest attainable standard of sexual health, including access to sexual and reproductive health care services. C. Guiding Principles for Affirmative Action propounded by WHO implies Affirmative approach to sexuality, Autonomy and self-determination and responsiveness to changing needs, Comprehensive understanding of sexuality, Confidentiality and privacy, Advocacy and Equity, Non-judgementaland Accessible services and programmes to the elderly. The following flowchart gives the treatment of sexual disorders in elderly.Figure",

      "abstract": "In the daily life there is evidence of nonconformity or discomfort of a select group of people inside their workplace; this particularity may, perhaps, be derived from multiple variables. As an example, are highlighted as the most common, family problems, some kind of financial crisis, problems with their health or a problem for which happiness does not achieve in their daily tasks, among others.\r\n     Others, despite having excellent compensation for the tasks entrusted, fail to develop full satisfaction in the execution of them, regardless of whether this situation generates a hypothetical personal and family fulfillment. This refers to the fact that sometimes an integral part of the person is sacrificed, up to his or her own dignity, in order to sustain a subjective ideal of emotional stability.\r\n     It could also be concluded that the lack of taste for their work, is due to the organizational culture in the company, the functions performed, the boss or directives, the work environment is not the best, growth policies or benefit systems are not ambitious enough to satisfy its employees.\r\n     However, it is evident in most cases, some factors that affect the performance of the companies and organizations themselves. Of the most relevant or common, stand out, the loss of days of work, this situation, which translates into significant economic costs for entities, since absenteeism is often associated with the reduction in performance and productivity, increase in unsafe work practices, greater number of complaints and claims from customers, and increased costs.\r\n     Both public and private entities present this problem on a different scale. Some with a higher rate of absenteeism, and others with a somewhat lower figure; the development of this work is in order to reduce the percentages of absenteeism on the part of public EPS officials; and also aims to consolidate a Plan for Improvement of such shortcomings, which include strategies for verification, identification, prevention and possible solution, which may, at the discretion of the entity, become effective.\r\n     The public EPS that was the object of study and the primary basis for the development of this investigative essay, is located in the city of Bogota, Colombia.

Many human X‐linked genes outside the X–Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X‐inactivation.

      "abstract": "Transsexualism describes the condition when a person's psychological gender differs from his or her biological sex. People with gender identity disorder suffer persistently from this incongruence and they search hormonal and surgical sex reassignment to the desired anatomical sex. This review, from an ethical perspective, intends to give an overview of structural and functional neurobiological correlations of transsexualism and their course under cross-sex hormonal administration. Several studies demonstrate an increased functional connectivity between cortex regions reaffirming psychosocial distress of psychologicalbiological sex incongruity. Such distress can be ascribed to a disharmonic body image due to changes in the functional connectivity of the key components of body representation network. These brain alterations seem to imply a strategic mechanism dissociating bodily emotions from bodily images. For a number of sexually dimorphic brain structures or processes, signs of feminization or masculinization are observable in transsexual individuals, who during hormonal administration seem to partly further adjust to characteristics of the desired sex. These changes allow a reduction of psychosocial distress. However, a model leading to a ″gender affirmation″ does not solve the problem, since brain disorders causing it are not corrected. This is a serious medical ethics issue. Prejudices should be left aside. To know what happens in the brain of transsexuals is a medical need, both to define what is and what is not, and so to choose an adequate treatment, and to decide and guide legal actions.",

It can be said that without sexual desire there would be no love, no sexual passion, and no sexual excitement. Humans therefore would be unable to propagate. Lu Xun once sagaciously pointed out that \"sexual desire is a matter of maintaining prosperity and perpetuating life.\" Once young people enter puberty, they have natural sexual desires and impulses. Often they try to relieve their sexual tensions and satisfy their sexual desires by masturbation or other self-comforting means. If young people do not control themselves, masturbation will become a bad habit that damages their physical and mental well-being. Some young people who cannot control their sexual impulses engage in premarital sex and even commit sexual crimes. Sexual debauchery after marriage may even lead to extramarital affairs and result in marital tragedy. Whether one is married or not, every person should keep a tight reign on his or her sexual desires and avoid licentiousness through self-control.",

In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. However, since sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place in the first two months of pregnancy and sexual differentiation of the brain starts in the second half of pregnancy, these two processes can be influenced independently, which may result in extreme cases in trans-sexuality. This also means that in the event of ambiguous sex at birth, the degree of masculinization of the genitals may not reflect the degree of masculinization of the brain. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who are socially connected are happier and healthier than their more isolated counterparts. Over the past few decades, researchers have established that both the quantity and quality of our social relationships are unequivocally important when it comes to our physical and mental health, and our risk of mortality. Although the link between social relationships and mental health is well established in a couple, we have only just begun to identify explanations for this link. Recently, social scientists have discovered that the link between social relationships and health is explained by our behaviours (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet), various psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, mental health, cultural norms), and physiological processes. Aggression in marital relationship is defined as a manipulative, physical or non-physical form of aggression meant to negatively impact the development of relationship by social exclusion or harming the social status of a victim by spreading or behaving negatively. Research findings suggest that even infrequent experiences with relational aggression victimization are associated with lower subjective well-being such as depression, loneliness, and positive affect. This case study investigates the existence of relational aggression in a couple and the relationship between relational aggression and own subjective well-being. The participant in the study is married and from nuclear family. The study tries to investigate aggression level through the case study method and relaxation, yoga, meditation techniques used which was used to resolve the aggression and helps to achieve well being.",

      "title": "Menstrual problems in adolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract During adolescence, girls become preoccupied with the physical and emotional changes which occur over a number of years, and which translate the girl into a fully sexually and reproductively competent adult female. These changes are also associated with changes in emotional and intellectual status, which identify the adult female as different from the adult male. The outward changes of breast growth, pubic hair and axillary hair growth, and the attainment of full adult height usually precede the outward manifestation of maturity, i.e. the menarche. For many girls their first menstrual period is truly the sign of adulthood and psychologically extremely important to achieve. However, it is also associated with times of stress and the absolute wish to be normal. Thus, changes that occur which are abnormal may have a very serious impact on psychological well-being. Being normal as an adolescent and accepted as a normal member of that peer group is extremely important. In differentiating the range of normality from true abnormality, an understanding of the onset and control of puberty is essential, as in many cases, misinformation leads these adolescent teenagers to states of anxiety which can be well avoided, and a deep knowledge and understanding of the adolescent will make management effective and help her to achieve normal adulthood. In fact, in some cases, poor management of menstrual problems at the time of adolescence may leave her with a life-long menstrual phobia which may be used in later life as a prop against adversity.",

Sex hormones are also responsible for the determination of those neutral centres controlling male or female sex behavior later in life in most species. Based on animal datas and on retrospective inquiries of homosexuals or mothers of homosexuals, a hypothesis for the etiology of homo-, bi- and hyposexuality has been developed by Dorner. Absence or deficiency of androgens in the critical phase of \"brain differentiation\" leads to male homo-, bi- or hyposexuality, respectively. If androgens become active in the critical phase of female differentiation, then the result will be female homo-, bi- or hyposexuality, respectively. This hypothesis will be critical evaluated.",

      "title": "Psychological development",
      "abstract": "Psychological development refers to growth and progress on the full gamut of human dimensions across the lifespan. The study of psychological development has been concerned with questions such as: What develops?; In what sequence?; Are there identifiable stages and phases of development?; What processes underlie developmental change?; Are there general principles of development and change that apply across all ages?; What factors enhance or retard development?; What explains inter-individual differences?; and To what extent is development socially and culturally determined? An engagement with the literature reveals a range of very different theoretical and empirical approaches to the above questions. Furthermore, the questions that are posed are typically framed within a particular theoretical position and/or contain basic theoretical assumptions about development. In the developmental literature there are two broad fields of enquiry: one concerned with the devel-opment of cognitive and intellectual capabilities across the lifespan; the other concerned with social and emotional development or one's sense of self or identity. The early research in both these fields of enquiry focused on child development – arguably because of the need to understand children's learning given the growth of education in the latter part of the nineteenth century and also because of a commonly held belief that adult maturity was the end-point of development. Nowadays a great deal of research has been undertaken on adult development. Once again this may beconnected with the need for adults to engage in lifelong learning in the context of continuing technological, social and organisational change and the subsequent increasing educational provision for adults in formal and informal settings throughout life. A common thread in the developmental literature, then, has been the application of developmental theories across the entire lifespan. In many ways the application of developmental theories to adults has raised new questions and issues that have helped shape thinking in relation to the development of children. For example, in adult developmental research there has been a general move away from identifying common sequences of predictable stages and phases, which characterised earlier attempts to document development. Instead the emphasis is now placed on the impact of social and historical factors in accounting for multidirectional change and variability in life trajectories (see for example, Smith and Baltes, 1999; Elder, 1998). Research into child development has followed suit, paying greater attention to the social and historical factors that influence the direction and timing of development. Of course this trend is also a response to the increasing need to recognise cultural diversity among those attending educational institutions. I am not suggesting that the pragmatic needs of educators alone drive the theory construction of developmental psychologists in a direct and explicit way, however,it is clear that broad social concerns, including those of educators, provide a context in which it is possible for developmental theorists to raise new questions and issues in their research. It is also worth noting that the education sector is a major user of the research on developmental psychology and this is understandable given that both education and developmental psychology have a common focus on learning.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Although the phenomenon of asexuality is not new – it was first mentioned in the 1950s, in the works of Kinsey et al. – it remained ignored and unstudied by the scientific community until Bogaert ignited new interest in this topic. In 2004, the author published his findings regarding the prevalence of asexuality and reported that 1.05% of the British population was asexual. Human asexuality is defined as a lack of sexual attraction to anyone or anything, either hetero or homosexual, although this definition is not consensual. Objectives/aims This work aims to review the conceptualization of asexuality, and the social, biologic and psychologic factors associated. Methods A review of relevant literature was conducted alongside online database research (PubMed and Medscape), using the keywords human and asexuality. Results Despite the fact that many approaches have been proposed to define asexuality (lack of sexual behavior, lack of sexual attraction, self-identification as asexual or a combination of the previous) there is growing evidence supporting the conceptualization of asexuality as a unique sexual orientation, thus representing a fourth category. It appears to be more frequent in women and associated to religiosity, lower education level, lower socioeconomic status, and poor health. Conclusions Despite the increased interest of the scientific community in the study of asexuality, many questions remain unanswered. Additional studies are crucial in order to provide a clear understanding and acceptance of asexuality in this highly sexualized and voyeuristic society we live in, and also to allow for a better understanding of the complexity of sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Gender identity is each person’s internal and individual experience of gender. Gender expression is how a person publicly expresses their gender. Gender incongruence (GI) is defined as a condition in which a person has a marked incongruence between the expressed or experienced gender and the biological sex at birth. Adolescence is a crucial period for the persistence or development of GI, due hormonal changes, peer relations and first romantic experiences. Objectives To make a revision of the literature about GI along childhood throughout adolescence. Methods Research in the literature with the words “gender identity”, “gender incongruence”, “gender dysphoria”, “childhood” and “adolescence” in scientific databases. Results GI is present in a small percentage of children, often provoking psychopathological distress. There is a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in these children, compared with the general population. In most cases the dysphoria does not persist until adolescence. There has been an increasing number of adolescents seeking for treatment at gender identity services. The studies show that after the onset of puberty, the probability of persistent GI is high and that adolescents submitted to hormonal suppression tend to continue the medical treatment. Conclusions Epidemiological formal studies about gender incongruence in children and adolescents are very few. Studies of prevalence in these populations are community studies and don’t reflect the true prevalence of GI, so it would be necessary to investigate its prevalence and persistence in different world populations. It’s also necessary to make more prospective studies about the long-term effects of the medical treatment of GI. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

The delinquencies under consideration are those arising in apparently \"normal\" families of good reputation and are not those largely determined socio-logically in slum areas or juvenile gangs of any economic level.

Some of the material has been published previously by us.<sup>1</sup>By means of study and concomitant treatment of the parents as well as of the child involved in the antisocial behavior, it becomes unmistakably evident that one or occasionally both parents derive unconscious, and less frequently conscious, vicarious gratification of their own poorly integrated",

Results showed that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past often had less active, less supportive and more strained sibling ties.

As a story about sex it is (possibly) salacious and will reveal things about me that some may regard as private, better left unsaid and unsuitable in an academic essay. Except that I am not an academic and this is not an academic essay but a story of someone usually identified as a (transsexual) woman. Except I don’t identify myself as a binary transsexual woman but as a non-binary assigned male at birth (AMAB) person. In writing about my sex life I want to ask a few questions about (my) gender, sexuality, identity and deception. \r\nSex, at least for me, can be risky in more ways than one. I’m anally receptive but sexual risk for me is not all about possible exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), it is also whether a sexual encounter might leave me as a victim of “trans panic”: will the next person who fucks me perhaps beat me senseless before claiming I deceived them and they didn’t know I was AMAB until it was too late? Am I at more risk, and also more deceptive, if a partner thinks I’m a cis-gender woman or a binary transsexual woman? Just where does the line between being “out and proud”, passing and deception lie for me as a non-binary AMAB surviving in a largely binary world? \r\nIn this essay, I thus wish to explore how issues of sex and deception might interact and raise questions for me as a non-binary, AMAB person. In doing so I will attempt to interweave a critical analysis of some media stories of sexual deception with an autoethnographic account of sex. I am not wise enough to have answers to my questions, however, but instead hope that others may do so.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although sexuality is valued throughout the lifespan, older women's sexual expression can be influenced by physical, mental and social factors, including attitudes and stereotypes held by younger generations. By gaining an understanding of what influences negative attitudes toward sexuality and beliefs about sexual consent capacity, the stigma associated with sexuality in late life may be reduced. Method: Using vignette methodology in an online survey, we examined older women's health and young adults' (N = 606; mean age = 18.86, SD = 1.42, range 17–36) general knowledge and attitudes toward aging and sexuality, personal sexual behavior, religious beliefs and perceived closeness with an older adult on attitudes towards sexual behavior and perceptions of consent capacity among older women. Results: The health status of older women proved important in determining young adults' acceptance and perception of sexual consent capacity regarding late-life heterosexual/autoerotic and homosexual behaviors. Specifically, young adults expressed lower acceptance and more doubt regarding capacity to consent to sexual expression when the older woman was described as cognitively impaired. Additionally, young adults' personal attitudes toward late-life sexuality, but not knowledge, predicted acceptance toward sexual expression and belief in sexual consent capacity. Conclusion: Attention toward the influence of older women's cognitive health and young adults' attitudes toward late-life sexuality may prove beneficial in designing interventions to decrease the stigma associated with sexual activity in later life.",

      "abstract": "Manipulation of the anus can produce sensations that are perceived to be pleasurable by certain individuals and may be interpreted as sexual sensations. Anal erotic activities have been noted in the professional literature and in popularised sex manuals, but a detailed accounting of these activities and statistics on their prevalence have not been well quantified. Much of the literature tends to generalise anal sexuality into anal intercourse, resulting in few publications on other anal activities. Because of the perceived cultural unpleasantness of the subject, researchers and subjects are reluctant to discuss more than cursory references to any such activity; however, recent social surveys have indicated that there may a higher level of interest in these activities than might be suspected. Anal manipulation, also known as anal masturbation, may be performed either as a prelude to other sexual activities or may be enjoyed as an activity in itself. It may be performed with a sex partner or as a form of autoeroticism, either independently or in conjunction with genital masturbation. This paper reviews anatomical, physiological and psychological aspects of anal masturbation. Methods include manipulation by the fingers, dildos and vibrators, and the insertion of small objects into the anus and rectum. Some of these activities are potentially hazardous, producing either internal physical damage or the introduction of pathogenic organisms. An extensive list of references on all these topics is included for readers to explore further aspects of the subject. (author abstract)",

Several reported having sexual kinks for penises but not sexual attractions to men. About three quarters reported unintentional changes to their sexual attractions or desires as they grew older. Additionally, over a third reported that their wives lost interest in sex, sometimes because it became painful or uncomfortable. Most preferred women for romantic partnerships, but were wary of casual hookups with women. The trait they felt made women better romantic partners—emotional compatibility—also made many uncomfortable with women as hookup partners, as they felt that women would become too attached. This was especially true for married men, most of whom did not want to threaten their marriage by having sex with another woman. Others had sex with men specifically to form nonromantic connections with men, such as to relieve loneliness or satisfy a need for touch. Several had sex with men to relieve the pressures of masculinity. Having another man penetrate them allowed some men to experience pleasure without having to be in control.",

      "title": "Eugene O'Neill's Concern with Sexuality and the Behavioral Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sex as a biological activity contains multiple aspects from pleasure to pain, and from ravishment to conjugal bliss; thus having the normal and abnormal elements. It is a primary source of reproduction carrying pleasure/orgasm or pain element in the process. Healthy sexual activities engender orgasmic responses (pleasure) and nurture human growth along healthy lines. Its derangement, however, may cause numerous psycho-biological and behavioural regressions Eugene O’Neill is primarily a dramatist of human emotions and is deeply concerned with dramatizing extremes of human behavioural tendencies with marked regressivity. His treatment of human sexuality is an illustration of his dramatizing extremes of emotive and psychological states with predominant regressive pattern in human conduct and attitude towards sexuality. Here he owes a lot to Freud’s psychoanalytic exploration of human consciousness and his theoretical stance on infantile psycho-sexual development in familial context. Therefore one comes across a persistent mode of incest in familial relation in his plays of different periods. The study, however, highlights here such other areas of human sexuality as marital sexuality, male sexual abstinence/wastefulness, female heterosexuality, prostitution, and neurasthenia with reference to selected plays of different dramatic career to emphasize that there is predominant pattern of regressivity in all these areas of human sexuality that has its negative bearing on human behavioural pattern and conduct.Key words:  Modern American drama; sexuality; behavioural disorders; neurasthenia",

      "abstract": "Abstract The sexual behaviour of sexually experienced Culicoides melleus males has been investigated. Immediately after completing a prior copulation, the male almost invariably makes only brief temporary union of the genitalia with a previously mated female before releasing his hold. Release is equally frequent whether the female be the male's original mate or the original mate of another male. In contrast, recently mated males frequently complete copulation at the first attempt with young virgin females, and virgin males almost invariably complete with recently mated females. The behaviour of sexually experienced individuals was found to depend on male sensitivity (acquired during copulation) to female defensive grooming before and after establishment of genital union. Defensive grooming provides the stimulus to which the sensitive male responds by releasing the female. Male sensitivity to the stimulus declines with passage of time since his last copulation.",

This will determine the extent to which experience can continue to be engaged with creatively and intimacy, including sexual intimacy, can be sustained. The importance of the capacity to adapt and adjust to the changes and losses of old age and to sustain intimacy is highlighted in research that shows that marital closeness moderates the negative psychological impact of functional disability in later life in terms of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. The couple were just entering later life, and facing depression as lifelong defences were wearing thin, he having had affairs throughout the marriage and confronted by impotence as a consequence of treatment for prostate cancer.",

I felt desexualised in my body, unaware of my autism but deeply aware of my alienation and social position. Unable to find a sexual reflection in popular culture and bombarded with tropes of toxic masculinity I turned my sexual desires inwards. Only with my closest confidant, my partner, did any semblance of sexuality emerge, mediated by images and symbols imbibed as a teenager. My deep desire for connection that extended into sexuality felt ossified and unaired—kept in an air-sealed wrapper, like a vintage toy to be sold in the future or admired on a shelf. The sexuality that emerges from within me doesn't feel constrained and defined by borders or the models used by the dominant culture. It is lush, verdant, warm, damp. It is not a shape defined by others. It is not attached to gender. It is not a taxonomical category to which I ascribe. My sexuality extends from the love that I easily feel towards other bodyminds like mine and the intimacy with which I seek to imbue relations. It need not be segregated and distinct.",

The data indicate that negative reactions to unfamiliar persons become common during the second half of the first year. Positive reactions also occur, and there is evidence that certain infant attributes, stranger characteristics, and contextual features affect whether or not the infant becomes distressed. This complex phenomenon can be best understood as a developmental organizer. The negative reactions noted in the literature have most often been construed as expressions of interpersonal wariness reflecting recognition of the stranger's unfamiliarity or novelty. The possibilities that such responses also mirror the infant's emerging sensitivity to atypical social behavior and intrapsychic anxiety about his developing sense of separateness are discussed. Examination of research methodology points to several common shortcomings in the studies.",

They also lose power over their lives more informally through everyday paternalism and the structural violence, constraints, institutionalisation, and abuse they experience at hugely disproportionate rates. The assumption that because of their disability some people simply do not have the cognitive abilities to exercise choice and control over their lives, and as a result must be restricted in the name of protection, is at the root of the ableism that pervasively shapes their lives. People with disabilities have been subject to, violated, and harmed by these ableist assumptions for centuries, and they underlie the legal and social justification for restricting or obstructing their right to legal capacity and liberty.",

      "abstract": "There have been several myths and misconceptions about the dichotomous understanding of sex and gender. While sex is biologically determined, gender and gender identity depend on childhood experiences, upbringing, social expectations, beliefs, family environment, and peer interactions and is socially constructed. Gender dysphoria (GD) is the extreme distress experienced by an individual because of a mismatch between their gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. GD has been an ambiguous category in psychiatry, initially termed as “gender identity disorder” till Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5) considered removal of the term “disorder” to reduce the stigma associated. The critical element in GD is “clinically significant distress” that differentiates it from gender nonconformity. Individuals with GD identify themselves as transgender and frequently are victims of coercive social norms, discrimination, and stigma. This leads to delay in expression of distress, psychiatric mismanagement, and high comorbidity of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, self-harm, and suicidality. Though management involves a holistic multidisciplinary approach including psychotherapy, social support, and gender-reassignment treatments (medical/surgical), there has been considerable debate and ambiguity related to the same. With this background, the article critics the understanding of GD, focuses on the WPATH SOC-7 treatment guidelines, and highlights the role of mental health professionals for better care.",

Similarly in the field of medical sociology when control is mentioned in relation to health and illness it is often presented in a unidimensional manner. This article analyses the relationship between control and responsibility for health in the lay accounts of male Glaswegians. Activist and fatalist dimensions were found in their thinking. However, activist thinking was seen to have three strands: personal activism, social activism, and religious activism. Further, fatalistic thinking was not about passive submission but rather the belief that control lay outwith the person in the realm of the social, natural or supernatural worlds. These findings demonstrate the subtle ways in which people relate to issues of control and responsibility in the health realm – a subtlety which is not fully brought out either in the theoretical or empirical work of social scientists researching in the health field.",

Neuere Erfahrungen haben gelehrt, daß echte Generationspsychosen, Psychosen von spezifischem Gepräge, die für bestimmte Generationsvorgänge charakteristisch wären, nicht existieren, daß vielmehr im Zusammenhange mit diesen Generationsvorgängen nur Krankheitsbilder vorkommen, die sich auch in anderen Lebensperioden finden.

      "abstract": "The initiation frequency and termination of breast-feeding are determined by cultural tradition. One of the most fundamental underlying differences among cultures affecting breast-feeding is the degree of mother-infant body contact. The physical distance may be seen as a reflection of the social distance sanctioned by their culture. A study of 60 societies found that in high body contact cultures the infant is almost continuously carried out by the mother in the early months; little or no clothing separates the mother and infant; and infants sleep with their mothers at night. Low body contact cultures are characterized by separation of the infant from the mother at birth; swaddling or elaborate clothing; sleeping in a cradle or crib not with mother. Warmer climates are conducive to higher body contact. The means of food-getting will affect the infants diet and time of weaning. cultures with domesticated animals may wean a child to cow or goat milk sooner than cultures where hunting of nuts and berries provides hard to digest food. In close body-contact societies breast-feeding is frequent on demand unsupplemented for the first 6-12 months and lasts from 2-6 years. Nursing frequency is twice an hour or more. Modern societies require strict clothing on the women and swaddling on the child. Nursing frequency is less. Those societies with the highest degree of body contact also show the longest mean duration of lactational amenorrhea.",

Based on physiological, metabolic and psychological measurements, it has been found that sexual intercourse does not affect positive or negatively physical performance in males.

These reasons are five in number: homosexuality is held to be unnatural, abnormal, a perversion, morally wrong or sinful and aesthetically repellent or disgusting. The first three of these unfavourable characterisations of homosexuality apply to it primarily as an orientation, a disposition to engage in homosexual activity, whether the disposition is manifested or not. The other two, the moral and aesthetic ones, so far as most of their proponents are concerned, apply only to homosexuality, as manifested in actual conduct. The desire to sin, after all, is a necessary condition of virtue. There is no merit in not doing things one has no desire to do. Similarly the desire to do something disgusting is hardly, in itself, disgusting.",

Clinically, practitioners are concerned with whether the difficulty lies in conception or carrying a pregnancy to term; however, in social science research the underlying focus is on the parents' inability to have a child more broadly. Age is a predominant factor in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, such that individuals who are aged 35 years or older are often labeled and treated as infertile within six months, rather than one year, of unprotected intercourse resulting in no pregnancy. Individuals can be characterized as having primary infertility, which is when they have no prior children, or secondary infertility, suggesting they have successfully birthed a child prior to their current attempt to become pregnant. Approximately 15 percent of couples, or 4.3 of the 28 million married couples in the United States, encounter difficulty conceiving at some point in their relational life span.",

When such obsession occurs, the person tends to get engrossed and lost either in the joy or the sorrow of the relationship. It mostly occurs among people in relevant or irrelevant relationships, who tend to live or not live together, who may have in-secured thoughts about the partner, and for several reasons not restricted to the mentioned. Finally, the conceptual understanding, empirical analysis and interpretation are facilitated through the done research in the current cultural context of Asia in a south Indian perspective.",

      "abstract": "Early dating is dating arranged by a couple of opposite sex, both or one of whom is a teenager under 14 years old. A couple of early dating mostly consists of an adult man and a girl of minor age. Audio-visual mass media, like television and wide-screen movie in a cinema, influence and provoke the teenagers to begin early dating. Early dating causes a high risk since the persons involved do not possess adequate mental stability and psychological maturity to make a good and right decision. In early dating the teenagers easily get bored with their couple because they do not know their purpose to do a dating. Those who begin dating at very early age more frequently catch headache, abdominal trouble and waist pains. They risk to be a fragile person of poor health, unsecured feeling and depression.",

      "title": "A growing awareness of harassment",
      "abstract": "In the past several years, professional societies have become acutely aware of the prevalence of sexual, racial, and other types of harassment, and the impact that such behavior has on their members and on their profession. Examples of egregious actions by prominent scientists have made headlines (http://wapo.st/2dx6rqk; http://wapo.st/1KcksIo; http://bit.ly/1TfkDGM) and have awakened all of us to a problem that went largely unreported in the past. The repercussions of these actions, frequently perpetrated on young women and on individuals from ethnic minorities entering the sciences, create a situation that directly counters the need to expand the number of women and underrepresented groups in science. Anecdotal evidence suggests that rather than risk skepticism, additional or intensified harassment, public shaming, or negative impacts on their careers, these young and talented people may simply leave academia or abandon science entirely. The consequences of these decisions directly affect the integrity and advancement of science. Ecologists, who typically work in small laboratories or in remote locations for long periods, have a special need to recognize the hazards that these situations can present and to implement responsible measures to educate and protect their colleagues and students at all stages of their careers. “What happens in the field stays in the field” is neither funny nor acceptable. What are required are standards for expected behavior, clear reporting processes, and penalties for those whose behavior violates ethical standards. ESA has an important role to play. In 2015, the Society developed a Meetings Code of Conduct (see http://bit.ly/2dUtOh6) that for the first time defined both expected and unacceptable behaviors, and outlined a reporting process and actions that ESA may take to address unethical conduct at its meetings. The recognition that even more needs to be done was spurred by a workshop, titled “Making Ecology Safer for Everyone”, that was held during the Centennial Meeting in Baltimore, also in 2015. The outcome of this workshop was a series of recommendations that were presented to the ESA Governing Board and that stimulated the Board to take action. A review of ESA's long-standing Code of Ethics (http://bit.ly/2dmV06b) was initiated to ensure that the topic of harassment was sufficiently covered and enforceable, and recommendations were sought for additional ways that ESA could respond to complaints. The review – undertaken by the ESA Professional Ethics and Appeals Committee, led by Patricia Flebbe – came to several conclusions. These included the following: (1) the ESA Code of Ethics is strong and complete with regard to harassment and does not require any changes; (2) the ESA Meetings Code of Conduct should be more visible at ESA meetings and on the ESA website, and should be highlighted in other ways; and (3) an ad hoc group should be named to develop a set of best practices and policies for preventing harassment, which outlines ways to improve the safety and security of ESA members regardless of their gender, age, ethnic background, geographic location, or professional status. The Governing Board authorized ESA President David Lodge to charge and establish this ad hoc committee, whose output will include a document that is tailored to ecologists but will also draw on examples already available from other sources, including various professional societies. While not neglecting laboratory and office environments, this document should emphasize the particular conditions characteristic of ecological field work. The committee, which will begin work early in 2017, will also recommend ways in which ESA can engage with and communicate these best practices and policies to its membership, and how to further highlight its Meetings Code of Conduct during annual meetings. While there have been very few reports of harassment at ESA annual meetings to date, the experience of other scientific societies suggests that once a code of conduct is published, more reporting of incidents can be expected. In anticipation of the need to deal fairly and responsibly with all parties concerned, ESA front-line staff will receive training in how to recognize harassment, how to communicate with everyone involved in the incident, and how and when to take further action. These efforts are a first step toward addressing a long-standing and rarely acknowledged issue. Continued discussion and awareness of harassment is critically important and will likely highlight other actions that scientific societies should take. Additional research, training, and enforcement will be necessary. Our goal must be to ensure that all ecologists can work, learn, teach, and do their research in a safe and welcoming environment.

      "title": "Loneliness and abuse as risk factors for suicide in older adults: new developments and the contribution of the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Old Age Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Suicide is a major public health problem, with 817,000 cases worldwide in 2016. The incidence is highest in those aged 70 years or older, among both men and women, in almost all regions of the world1. Effective interventions that mitigate iden­tified risk factors and sustain protective fac­tors are relevant across all age groups, but re­search specifically focused on suicide pre­vention in older adults is still in its early stag­es. The evidence on the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions for older adults remains limited. The International Association for Suicide Prevention Interest Group on Suicide in Old Age2 recommended multi-component approaches, based on the available scientific evidence, with an organized system of distribution of resources and the monitoring of the effectiveness of each intervention. Loneliness occurs when a person feels disconnected from his/her closest social circle: partners, family members, peers, friends and significant others. It often affects older adults, particularly men when single, widowed or divorced3. It may result from the loss of an important intimate relationship or a social role that previously used to give a person his/her sense of self-esteem and dignity. In case of negative life events or other psychological stressful situations, when the person has nobody to share his/her feelings with, loneliness can have particularly negative consequenc­es. This, in combination with other risk factors, can lead to an increase of the risk for suicidal behaviour. A particular expression of loneliness among older adults is the fact that suicides more often occur when the person is alone at home4. The consequences of the COVID-19 pan­demic have resulted in new challenges for older adults, and we are just beginning to see the effects on morbidity, mortality and suicide rates worldwide5. Many government policies to tackle the pandemic that include social isolation, lockdown and social distancing have resulted in increased distress in older adults. We therefore need to develop strong primary care and commu­nity assets to support older adults. A rise in suicide deaths in older adults as a result of the pandemic is not inevitable6. The traditional approaches to suicide prevention need to be re-considered7, so that we can develop innovative ways to address this issue in older adults in the new context. The voices of people with lived experience should be heard to inform developments in strategies. Previous traumatic experiences (e.g., history of abuse during childhood, loss of a parent) can have consequences in later life and be associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behaviour. But present traumatic experiences may also increase the risk for suicide. According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 6 older people experienced some form of abuse in the past year8. However, the prevalence rates reported in existing population-based elder abuse studies likely underestimate the true population prevalence. Not only this field of research suffers from methodological and comparability challenges, but elder abuse prevalence surveys also carry substantial participation bias, in that they exclude individuals with cognitive impairment, who could potentially be most vulnerable to abuse, especially in institutions. Older adults with mental health problems are at high risk for abuse. There are many forms of elder abuse, including psychological, physical, sexual, financial and social abuse, as well as neglect and abandonment. Abuse should never be condoned, whatever the mitigating circumstances. What may not be considered abusive towards a healthy, competent person may be so in a vulnerable older adult. This is mainly explained by the high risk of older adults to be dependent (financially, emotionally, physically) from the persons who perpetrate acts of violence, abuse or neglect against them. Each form of elder abuse represents a risk factor for suicide. Several psychosocial risk factors found in severely abused older adults are also frequently present in older adults who attempted or completed suicide. Abused older adults have been paid inadequate attention in suicide prevention efforts. This omission must be remedied, as the aged global population will dramatically increase in coming decades, which, in the absence of meaningful preventive efforts, may drive a sharp rise in the incidence of older adults' abuse and suicide9. Help to establish strong social relationships and an effective legal frame to protect the individual against any form of violence are common protective factors against suicide. However, in the case of older adults, we should recognize that efforts to sustain these protective factors have been weaker than for the younger population. Considering the high potential of loneliness as a risk factor for suicide, the WPA Section on Old Age Psychiatry has supported the establishment of an End Loneliness Day. The Section is also going to become partner of the Campaign to End Loneliness. Having the friendship and support we need is a fundamental part of our well-being. When loneliness becomes entrenched in later life, it can be hardest to overcome. The campaign aims to involve academics, front-line practitioners, decision-makers and businesses (see https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org). Considering that all forms of elder a­buse are a violation of basic human rights, the WPA Section on Old Age Psychiatry is contributing to the effort to develop a new United Nations Convention on the Rights of Older Persons. A first action was a webinar organized in collaboration with the International Psychogeriatric Association on December 10, 2020, on the occasion of the Human Rights Day. The Section also organized an intersectional symposium on Threats to the Dignity of Older Adults with Mental Disorders during COVID-19 Pandemic within the 2020 WPA Thematic Meeting on Intersectional Collaboration. A Position Statement on Human Rights and Mental Health of Older Adults is now in preparation.",

      "title": "ABORDAGEM DA SEXUALIDADE NA TERCEIRA IDADE COM MULHERES DE UM CENTRO DE CONVIVÊNCIA DO IDOSO NO MUNICIPIO DE SANTARÉM-PA",
      "abstract": "APRESENTACAO: A sexualidade e descrita como um processo inerente e indissociavel a essencia humana, que comeca ao nascimento e so termina com a morte do individuo, desta forma e evidente que nao se restringe apenas a pratica do ato sexual como e, geralmente, idealizado pelo senso comum, mas a um amplo espectro emocional que envolve afeto, caricias e principalmente o sentimento mutuo, entre outros fatores que se modificam, em consonância com o desenvolvimento do ser humano. Assim nao e a idade que determinara a presenca ou ausencia da sexualidade, mas a vontade do individuo de instiga-la.  E inevitavel que o envelhecimento acarrete uma diversidade de modificacoes anatomicas, fisiologicas e psicossociais que, por sua vez, nao inibem o processo sexual, porem excita nas pessoas a criacao de mitos e tabus preconceituosos relacionados a “velhice assexuada”, ou seja, ocorre a desvalorizacao da sexualidade no tocante a terceira idade, entao os senis se desestimulam e ate proclamam-se incapazes de prosseguir sua vida sexual mesmo que o exercicio desta maximize o bem-estar, influencie na manutencao da saude e corrobore para o reconhecimento do anciao enquanto ser ativo e funcional na sociedade.  Desta forma o objetivo da pesquisa foi conhecer e analisar a vivencia da sexualidade na terceira idade, a partir de idosas vinculadas ao centro de Convivencia de Idosos (CCI) no municipio de Santarem-PA. METODOLOGIA: Trata-se de um estudo de campo com embasamento bibliografico, de cunho quantitativo executado em um centro de convivencia de idosos no municipio de Santarem, no Estado do Para, Brasil. O universo amostral foi composto por 25 mulheres compreendendo a faixa etaria de 60 a 80 anos, que frequentassem assiduamente a referida instituicao, estivessem lucidas, sem nenhum tipo de alteracao psicologica que pudesse comprometer o andamento da pesquisa e todas as participantes deveriam residir em Santarem. Mediante a regularizacao etica foi aplicado um questionario fechado a fim de obter as informacoes referentes ao estudo para posterior analise. RESULTADOS: De acordo com a analise dos dados constatou-se que 44% das mulheres encontravam-se na faixa etaria entre 66 a 70 anos de idade, 24% entre 60 a 65 anos, 20% dentre 76 a 80 anos e 12% entre 71 a 75 anos, destas 36% permaneciam casadas, 32% viuvas, 18% solteiras e 14% divorciadas, sendo que 81% apresentava renda media de um salario minimo, 14% dois salarios minimos e 5% outros valores, e valido ressalta que grande parte delas era catolica (96%), enquanto que 4% eram evangelicas, no quesito raca, 65% autodenominavam-se pardas, 23% se classificava branca, 8% da raca negra e 4 % de etnia indigena. 88% afirmaram que tinham filhos, enquanto que 12% nao tiveram filhos, 35% afirmaram morar com o companheiro, 30% com os filhos, 26% residiam sozinhas e 9% alegaram moram com os netos, quanto ao tempo de cadastro na instituicao ja referida 9% estava ha dois anos, 8% frequentavam a tres, 8% ha quatro anos e 75% eram institucionalizados a outro intervalo de tempo.   Ao que concerne a sexualidade propriamente dita 33% consideravam como obtencao de prazer, 28% compreendiam como o ato sexual/coito, 17% como ato exclusivo para funcao reprodutiva, 17% caracterizaram como desejo e 5% referiram como orgasmo. Das 25 mulheres 79% responderam nao apresentar nenhuma dificuldade ou constrangimento em discutir ou dialogar sobre sexualidade, entao, foram questionadas se consideravam sexualmente ativas, onde 70% replicaram sim e 30% classificaram-se como inativas. Quanto aos obstaculos vivenciados durante o ato sexual 69% delas arguiram nao ter nenhum, 8% asseguraram sentir desconforto, 4% relataram dispaurenia, 4% vergonha e 15% afirmaram ter outras sensacoes. CONSIDERACOES FINAIS: A expressao da sexualidade na terceira idade, assim como no adulto jovem e considerado necessidade fisiologica e reflete na qualidade de vida, no entanto este processo pode estar prejudicado de acordo com significacoes culturais norteados por mitos e arguicoes preconceituosas, destarte a sexualidade na terceira idade pode e deve ocorrer de maneira satisfatoria caso busquem redescobrir e acarretar um novo significado a este processo que, sem duvida sera diferente daquele vivenciado na juventude, porem ainda tera carater prazeroso e benefico. Constatou-se que a maioria das pesquisadas compactuavam com uma vida sexual ainda ativa e positiva, porem uma parcela menor ainda tratava a sexualidade como alheio a seu cotidiano ou apresentavam problemas no ato sexual, este feitio pode estar relacionado, possivelmente, a forma como a pessoa vivenciou a sua sexualidade, como adquiriu conhecimentos a respeito ou como foi construida sua identidade sexual, cultural e social.  Neste contexto, ressalta-se a premissa do aconselhamento a estas mulheres com a finalidade de melhorar a qualidade de vida e, consequentemente, a saude e ate mesmo daquelas que ja desempenham os atos sexuais de forma oportuna, a fim de minimizar as doencas de modo transmissivel. Outra estrategia de suporte, com suma importância seria a insercao continuada da educacao e incentivo a sexualidade, realizado pelos proprios funcionarios do centro de convivencia do idoso, pois de acordo como os dados da presente pesquisa, grande percentagem participa frequentemente do CCI a tempo significativo, viabilizando as acoes em longo prazo, ratificando que e objetivo destas instituicoes promoverem a insercao e a valorizacao do idoso na sociedade, bem como auxilia-lo a gozar de seus direitos, dentre eles a saude biopsicossocial. No âmbito da sexualidade surge entao a percepcao e atitudes dos cuidadores face as mais complexas situacoes encontradas quando do apoio prestado, que nem sempre sao as mais positivas para a qualidade de vida dos idosos, e que, carecem ser compreendidas e analisadas. Fazendo-se necessario que a equipe multidisciplinar que presta cuidados aos idosos atenda-os de forma mais ampla atentando-se para as necessidades, sejam elas fisicas, psicologicas, emocionais ou sociais e assim desenvolver uma assistencia com olhar holistico e sem preconceito. Portanto, a enfermagem deve desempenhar de forma parcial este encargo atraves de palestras, rodas de conversas, discussoes em grupo, entre outras metodologias ativas, uma vez que esta diametralmente ligada a cliente seja na atencao basica ou hospitalar e esta apto a orienta-la, assim como promover pesquisas em relacao ao tema supracitado em acao conjunta as demais areas de conhecimento, considerando a relevância e importância no contexto social.",

Information about sexual problems should be started, so that teens do not seek information from another person or from sources that are not clear or even wrong at all. Giving information about sexual problems become s even more important in view of teenagers who are sexually active in potency, because it is associated with hormone-influenced sexual drive and often do not have enough information about their own sexual activity. Of course it w ill be very harmful to the mental development of a teenager when he does not have the right knowledge and information.

      "title": "Adolescent females with 46, XY Disorders of Sexual Differentiation",
      "abstract": "Disorders of sex development are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal and anatomical sex of an individual is atypical. The sex of an individual is governed by chromosomal complement, which in turn decides the development of bi-pontential gonad and differentiation of external as well as internal genitalia into a definitive human sex either male or female. Though this is the general plan of sex development, most of the times in spite of being normal chromosomal complement, the gonadal and/ or genital sex is discordant leading to conditions known as disorders of sex development. Depending upon the chromosomal complement, these conditions are classified as (a) sex chromosome DSD (b) 46, XY DSD and (c) 46, XX DSD. Though most of the DSDs present at infancy with genital ambiguity and other clinical features, some of these conditions may not present or get recognized until adolescence and presenting as lack of pubertal development or primary amenorrhea. This leads to a social stigma to the patient as well as the family members and proper counselling and management of these cases can be improved by understanding the molecular pathology of these conditions. This review helps to understand the molecular genetics of 46, XY DSD in adolescent females who present as lack of puberty and primary amenorrhea.",

      "abstract": "Visitor effects are the behavioral and/or physiological changes that occur in animals when they are in proximity to unfamiliar people. These changes, if they occur at all, may be considered negative if they appear to challenge the animals' ability to cope and could thus compromise welfare, or positive if they appear to enhance the animals' welfare state. Visitor effects may be influenced by housing and husbandry, the behavior of people, individual characteristics of the animals, and their species. Negative visitor effects can often be reduced by providing animals with more opportunities to avoid public view. Previous research suggests that visitor effects are negative for many captive primates, indicating that human proximity is stressful, but in most cases the effect does not seriously compromise animal welfare.",

      "abstract": "While it is generally accepted that the ground-plan of adult personality is laid down in infancy and childhood, it is not sufficiently recognized that its final shape will depend on the experiences of adolescence. The challenge of physical development, especially the demands of mature sexuality and the push to become free of dependence on parents during adolescence, places the individual in a critical situation, when he can either move forward or cling to infantile modes of functioning. We do not fully understand the smooth transition from adolescence to adulthood, but our work with disturbed individuals helps us to recognize some of the factors that interfere with this process. Before giving examples of disturbed individuals, I would like to spell out some of the special features of adolescent development.",

It refers to individuals in whom abnormalities of sexual development have led to a confusion of the exact sex; to those with some of the reproductive organs of both sexes; and to patients whose anatomic appearance is one sex, but whose somatic chromatin is opposite. Intersexual should not be used when referring to those showing the endocrine phenomena of postnatal virilization or feminization; the person with an abnormal psychosexual drive; or the individual with just any form of bisexual manifestation. The correct diagnosis of intersexual problems may be difficult, but with the routine careful inspection of the genitals of all infants at birth, disastrous errors may be prevented. Where there is doubt, an oral or vaginal cytological smear is probably the simplest method for determining the chromosomal sex.",

It points out major areas of concern to interested professionals and highlights certain points of overlap between medicine and the behavioral sciences. The chapter begins with a discussion of some of the assumptions and definitions that underlie the material on sexual dysfunctions. The dichotomy, organic versus psychogenic, is often proposed to separate sexual disorders into distinct categories. Dysfunction in its most general sense refers to interference with the typical, desired, or biological role of some phenomena. The definition of sexual dysfunction must include a recognition than problems can exist in one or more aspects of sexual behavior. An interactional model insists that influences upon sexuality cannot be compartmentalized into independent factors.",

The range of issues is enormous, and the \"presenting patient\" may be either the adolescent or concerned parents who may look to the physician for counsel, evaluation, and solutions related to sexual behavior of the youth in the family. Our culture has notoriously distorted the role of sexuality in human relationships, often making effective interventions and education difficult. As a result of this distortion, many youth have come to believe that one rite of passage into adulthood is sexual intercourse. They mimic sexual behavior as portrayed by the media—sexual behavior that is often without communication, consequence, or commitment.",

We also know that SGM individuals are at higher risk of abuse, family alienation, trafficking, mood disorders, drug and alcohol dependence, home insecurity, suicide, and school dropouts. All these risks can be attributed, or are exacerbated by minority stress, derived from systemic and pervasive bias and oppression. Anti-SGM prejudice at all levels creates obstacles to high-quality and affirming medical and mental health care, despite the increased needs. These risks are informed and affected by many factors, including developmental stage, temperament, attachment quality, trauma history, culture, religion, laws, and health/ability status. Despite or perhaps because of the many challenges, SGM individuals also demonstrate stress-related growth, resulting in gains in several socio-emotional and psychological arenas. This chapter will grapple with the risks, and explore affirming, trauma-informed, and resilience-building approaches to care at all levels.",

It might result in the explanation of many characteristics of the neuroses. Homosexuality is a wholesale inversion. Recognition of the sexual lie in themselves and in adults cannot be repressed by children without a substitute formation, and a number choose for the representation of their feelings the formula which children use otherwise also for the representation of an untruth: inversion. But the inversion of the libido generally takes place only in puberty, when sexual desires arc biologically strengthened and are therefore inhibited and transposed to the infantile level.",

A further aim of this research was the inspection of the Parsons and Bales proposition of complementarity of expressive and instrumental specialization. The results indicated that while women were strongly committed to expressive activities during the infancy of their children, the intensity of this commitment decreased substantially in early childhood. Males, while relatively less involved in expressive activities, still assumed a substantial portion of the expressive functions of the family, and maintained the level of this commitment throughout the infancy and early childhood of their offspring. A moderate level of male-female expressive complementarity was found in the infant caregiving activities; beyond infancy, however, the complementary relationship disappeared completely. Finally, no evidence was found to support a principle of complementary expressive-instrumental specialization in the family.",

      "title": "Beyond the birds and the bees and was it good for you?: Thirty years of research on sexual communication.",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual experience and expression is of fundamental importance to most people. However, most people do not communicate effectively about sexuality even when it is important to do so. For example, many parents see it as their responsibility to talk to their children about sexuality and yet do not engage in in-depth discussions with their children about sexual topics. Most romantic partners have difficulty telling each other what pleases and displeases them sexually. Many health care professionals do not meet their patients' needs for information about the sexual changes they experience as a result of their disease or treatment. Many psychologists also are not doing a good job of addressing sexuality in the classroom, in practicum and internship settings, and/or with clients. These instances of poor sexual communication are unfortunate as effective sexual communication can have a range of positive outcomes such as more satisfying relationships and positive sexual health and well-being over the life span. This paper reviews sexual communication in all of these contexts, focusing on findings from my program of research spanning more than 30 years. Keywords: sexual communication, sexual education, couples, adolescents It is a truism to state that sexual experience and expression is of fundamental importance to most people; indeed, this statement is not controversial and needs no citations. There is no place in which this is more evident than in the media. Certainly, sexual images and tips about enhancing our sexual relationships, sexual experiences, and ability to please our partner are ubiquitous in the media. There is a great deal that has been and could be said about the content and impact of these media messages, particularly about their negative effects, but that is a topic for another time and place and is not the focus of the present paper. Rather, this paper focuses on interpersonal sexual communication - between parents and their children, between partners, between health care professionals and their patients, between professors and psychology graduate students, and between psychologists and their clients. I have drawn on select data (i.e., data from larger studies) from several strands of my research program spanning more than 30 years to support my contention that there is a great deal of room for improvement in how we communicate about sexuality in every one these contexts. Because each section of this paper could be a review paper in its own right, I have not, for the most part, reviewed the results of studies by other researchers on these topics. There are two major limitations to my research that are important to identify from the outset. One is that most, if not all, of the research I cite is with heterosexual individuals. This is because, typically, there have not been enough sexual minority participants for me to be able to analyse their data. The other limitation is that, in keeping with the population of New Brunswick where I conduct my research, the participants in my studies are primarily white and of European descent. Still, sexual communication among most ethnocultural minority groups living in Canada is even more limited than among the majority culture (Cappon et al., 1996; Manson Singer et al., 1996) suggesting that, if anything, the results would be stronger among these groups. Parent-Child Sexual Communication or the Birds and the Bees Most parents believe that they have a role to play in their children's sexual health education as a way to communicate family values, prevent negative sexual health outcomes, and prepare their children for adulthood (Croft & Asmussen, 1992; McKay, Pietrusiak, & Holowaty, 1998; Weaver, Byers, Sears, Cohen, & Randall, 2002). Although parents may not readily identify this as a goal of their sexual communication with their children, I believe that communicating positive attitudes toward both sexuality and talking about sexual topics is another important outcome of parent- child sexual communication. …",

      "abstract": "The history of abortion is a very long one. Every people and nation used different and widely varied methods during the centuries to get rid of unwanted pregnancies. Unfortunately, in most instances, the great majority of these methods was equivalent to zero effectiveness, or, too often, to suicide. Legal aspects of induced abortion have changed considerably with the passing of time and according to countries; these days 36% of the world countries admit abortion on request, 24% for specific reasons only, 16% for medical reasons only, and 8% still consider it an illegal practice. In Mexico abortion is legal only when pregnancy would imply death of the mother, when it is the result of rape of minors, or when it is done on women with very serious mental pathology. Obviously abortion is not the solution to unwanted pregnancies; an improvement in the socioeconomic condition and in the quality of life of many people would be a much better, and more difficult, approach to the solution. Psychosocial factors of abortion involve concepts which are difficult to define, such as those of the wanted or of the unwanted child, and can cause problems which are very difficult to handle. Health education, and sex education in particular, should not only teach the fundamentals of reproduction, but respect and consideration for the phenomenon of procreation, and a strong sense of personal and social responsibility toward family planning.",

When populations with specific perinatal complications have been studied longitudinally abnormalities have been found, but these tended to disappear with age. When infants born prematurely were followed through school age, the deficits in their intelligence at earlier ages were greatly reduced in later years. The major impact of biological defects associated with reproductive casualty appears to occur in the first weeks of pregnancy when spontaneous abortions produce many fetal losses.

      "title": "Preservation of Function in Genitourinary Cancers: Psychosexual and Psychosocial Issues",
      "abstract": "GU cancers are commonly associated with treatment-related sexual dysfunction, varying from mild to severe. For the clinical oncologist, it is important to be aware that sexual problems or sexual dysfunction may occur as a result of any aspect of cancer and cancer treatment. Sexual function is sensitive to the effects of trauma, both physical and emotional. This is particularly the case for patients whose cancer affects their genitals. Despite some commonalities of psychosocial and psychosexual issues in GU patients across diagnostic categories, GU patients do not present as one distinct, homogeneous group. GU neoplasms, with the exception of bladder cancer, affect mostly men. Men and women tend to differ in their ways of dealing with emotional distress and physical illness. While the man may typically do well using denial as a defense and may not want to discuss his feelings about his diagnosis and treatment, his partner may suffer if her way of coping is oriented toward communicating thoughts and feelings about the situation. Another important difference in this population is related to age and developmental differences. Testicular cancer typically is diagnosed in young men between the ages of 15 and 34 (46). The patients often still live with their parents or have just formed families of their own. In contrast, prostate cancer is diagnosed in older men, who are at a completely different stage in their lives when they have to deal with this challenge. Developmental stage at the time of diagnosis and treatment is an important variable in adaptation to cancer (47). Since GU malignancies and their treatments directly or indirectly affect sexual organs and sexual functioning, issues of sexual body image and identity as men or women are frequent concerns for GU patients. This is most obviously the case for men facing penectomy or orchiectomy. Similarly, women undergoing cystectomy with its simultaneous removal of uterus, ovaries, and parts of the vaginal wall face issues regarding their femininity as well as doubts about future sexual functioning. However, body image concerns are not limited to these two groups but may affect any cancer patient. The experience of having lost all hair due to chemotherapy, bearing of surgical scars, lost or altered functioning, and just the realization of having had cancer may change the way a patient feels about his/her body permanently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Many men who have sex with men (MSM) in midlife (40-64 years) and older adulthood (65+ years) have survived a lifetime fighting and advocating for equality given exposures to social discrimination attributed to stigmatized social identities (e.g., sexual orientation, racial/ethnic minority, and HIV-positive status). Few public health research efforts have given attention to how MSM’s exposure and salience of social discrimination across the life course have shaped social well-being in midlife and older age. Three studies were conducted using a cross-sectional healthy aging sub-study of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Study 1 explored whether older adulthood, racial/ethnic minorities, and HIV+ serostatus were associated with higher prevalence of any lifetime, any sexuality-related, and multifactorial (number of discrimination types) discrimination. Non-Hispanic Blacks were associated with greater any lifetime discrimination (aOR=1.42, p<0.001) and associated with less sexuality-related discrimination (aOR=0.56, p=0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was a statistically significant interaction associated to multifactorial discrimination between Non-Hispanic Black identity and HIV serostatus (aOR=0.46, p=0.019). Interestingly, no statistically significant differences in discrimination were observed by age cohort. Study 2 examined current internalized homophobia by discrimination exposure and salience. We observed no statistically significant differences in internalized homophobia by any discrimination or salience variables. Study 3 assessed differences in six indicators of social well-being (attachment, social integration, guidance, reassurance of worth, reliable alliance, and opportunity for nurturance) by discrimination exposure and salience. Though the mean scores for social well-being indicators were high overall, both any lifetime discrimination and multifactorial discrimination were negatively associated with indicator scores except opportunity for nurturance. Sexuality-related discrimination was negatively associated with social integration only. Across all discrimination salience variables, participants who reported discrimination and no/low salience exhibited lower scores on social well-being indicators than participants who reported no discrimination. Study 3 extended the public health literature on aging MSM, elucidating the role of salience on discrimination’s relationship to social well-being and that despite social adversity, these men have been able to maintain or achieve high social well-being. Future research should continue exploring midlife and older adult MSM’s resiliencies to identify factors that interrupt the deleterious impact of discrimination on health.",

      "abstract": "The proposed inclusion of a hebephilic sexual orientation (early pubescent males and/or females) in DSM-5 compromises the scientific credibility of psychiatry. Moralism about the age of an acceptable sexual partner drives this proposal. It ignores common patterns of sexual arousal, cultural variability, and historic precedents. It blurs the domains of psychiatry and law. The age of sexual consent is 14 in much of Europe. An example of the new mentally disordered would be a 19 year old with a consenting 14 year old. Where sexual interaction is legally accepted, but pathologized as mental disorder, psychiatry attempts to act as an agent of social control.",

Even long-standing enthusiasm for a concept or subject matter can fade unexpectedly in the face of empirical inconsistencies, theoretical cul-desacs, or methodological difficulties, to say nothing of the vagaries of research funding. Yet, we have little hesitation in describing the two main topics of this volume—(1) self and social identity and (2) social and behavioral aspects of physical health and illness-as research areas whose current high levels of activity and productivity are likely to remain constant, if not intensify, in the foreseeable future. Over the past few decades, each of these topics has become a firmly established focus of investigation.",

      "abstract": "Public knowledge and beliefs about urinary incontinence in adulthood are potentially significant contributors to the success or lack of success of intervention strategies. This is especially true given the repeated finding that significant proportions of incontinent people (at least half) do not report their incontinence to a physician. Although there is little literature on this topic, at least three salient features need to be recognized. First, there is an indication that laypeople have vague understandings of the causes and parameters of incontinence. The functioning of the human body is a mystery to many adult Americans. This lack of information is fostered by cultural beliefs that the body is something off-limits, that its functions are the appropriate domain of specialists. Of course, educational factors and possibly ethnic affiliations modify this lack of information. Lack of information is compounded by lack of an appropriate vocabulary. Clinicians must be aware that a patient's understanding of the body or terminology for bodily functions may not fit their own framework. Second, there is consistent evidence that elderly people often consider urinary incontinence to be an inevitable and irremediable part of the normal aging process. This linkage of incontinence and normal aging is probably protective of self-esteem but does little to foster amelioration of incontinence. The belief that incontinence signals oncoming incompetence is a cultural construction that is apparent in popular culture, such as literature and movies and reflected in the secrecy attendant on much incontinence in later life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Abstract The role of personality in marital sexual satisfaction was investigated in 102 married couples, studying three major measurable personality dimensions–extraversion-introversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. The results indicated that for females greatest sexual satisfaction in marriage occurred when the male's personality was essentially identical to the female's for extraversion-introversion and neuroticism; for these same couples, however, the males sexual satisfaction was not related to such personality similarity or dissimilarity. Interestingly, for males, greatest sexual satisfaction in marriage was found when spouses were essentially identical in the personality dimension of psychoticism. Thus, all three personality dimensions were shown to be related to sexual satisfaction in marriage. Personality \"fit\" between marital partners would appear to be important for sexual satisfaction, with females perhaps being more sensitive to personality than males. If the three personality dimensions are ranked in terms of their psychiatric illness implications, from extraversion-introversion (least) to neuroticism to psychoticism (most), one might speculate that females resonate to the more normal aspects of personality, relative to males who may resonate to less healthy aspects of personality. These results have not before been reported in marital analyses. They open up a fascinating range of new approaches to understanding the sources of male and female marital sexual satisfaction.",

Their responses to questions about the causes, characteristics, and psychosocial functioning of obesity suggest an innate desire and possible need for a more robust stature, a bigger presence, and a feeling of weight which appeared to supercede any acquired negative attitudes to fatness.",

Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to most sociosexual behaviors and attitudes. In men, Machiavellianism was linked to various sociosexual outcomes, in women those outcomes were associated with psychopathy instead. Agreeableness was hardly correlated with sociosexual outcomes. The Dark Triad traits were more strongly correlated with the studied outcomes even after controlling for agreeableness or for the dark core. Unexpectedly, men who were Machiavellian and agreeable reported the most sex partners in different contexts, but not psychopaths. In contrast, women who were psychopathic not only had more sex partners in general, but they also engaged in more unprotected sex, and one-night stands than men did. These findings build on prior research on the Dark Triad traits and their associations with sociosexuality and help to draw a more nuanced and modern picture of those relationships.",

      "abstract": "A theory of pseudomaturity or precocious development has been suggested to explain how mis-timing of adult transition events (occurring too early) can generate difficulties later in life. In a community sample, the age at which 30 adult activities (including various types of drug involvement) were begun were examined for an underlying factor structure, sex differences, and general and specific correlates with various aspects of adult functioning. Five factors were identified, confirmed, and moderately correlated including age of; drug initiation, financial autonomy, independent living, intimacy involvement, and deviant activities. Age at puberty did not load on any factor and was only significantly related to age of intimacy Involvement. Men were involved in drug use, financial autonomy, and deviant activities earlier than women, whereas women began puberty and intimacy at younger ages than the men. Pseudomaturity as reflected in a general construct and specific scales was significantly associated with numerous aspects of later adult role functioning, including drug abuse, socioeconomic status, intimacy involvement, emotional distress, divorces, criminal activities, and job instability. Although certain pseudomature behaviors consistently had adverse later consequences (early drug initiation to later drug abuse), others had differential impact on adult role functioning based on whether the transition event occurred in isolation (financial autonomy alone had beneficial long-term effects) or whether it was associated with a general lifestyle of pseudomaturity (with overall negative consequences).",

While there are no general indicators of ill health associated with masturbation, it can be powerfully negative or positive for many individuals. As an example, it is widely used in sex therapy as a means of improving the sexual health of the individual and/or relationship. Promoting masturbation as a means of a public health strategy for sexual health is highly controversial; however, there are arguments and evidence that suggest that this may be an important part of any public health approach to improving sexual health. There is a need for more research on the impact of masturbation on self-esteem, body image, sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction and methods for using masturbation to promote sexual health. There is also a need for more of a theoretical approach to the formation of hypotheses to be tested.",

      "abstract": "In this research work, the situation experienced by married men with children who begin their bisexuality is analyzed through a case study, through a semi-structured interview with a 36-year-old man, in order to determine the factors that guide people to have sexual relations with other men, in secret, and the role that sexual education plays. Based on the information collected in the interview, it can be analyzed that even though we live in the 21st century, there are still many myths and paradigms about homosexual and bisexual people, due to the form of education, customs, religion and traditions that are transmitted from parents to children. On the other hand, talking about sexuality is a topic full of taboos, which prevents people from openly expressing their sexual desires and experiences, due to fear of being rejected and judged, due to the moral norms established in a society. For this reason, some married men maintain a secret erotic relationship with other men. In our case study, the subject's first experience was under the influence of alcohol consumption, later manifesting the guilt syndrome. Religion is also a key piece in our study, because they live as heterosexual people, because custom and what dictates that a man must be with his woman, however, sexually they do not feel satisfied or have other fantasies that they cannot fulfill your partner, seeking that satisfaction in men with particular characteristics, such as: age, physical build, behavior, appearance, among other aspects. Eradicating discrimination and rejection towards bisexual people is not only a social problem but also a health problem. It is important to correctly educate the population regarding sexuality, seeing it not only from the reproductive side but also from all its other characteristics.",

The emerging gender difference (more girls depressed than boys) in depressed mood and depressive disorders appears after the age of 13 years or midpuberty. Currently, little evidence supports that biological factors are an explanation. Genetic factors are associated more strongly with depression among pubertal girls than boys. Regarding cognitive factors, ruminative response style, but not dysfunctional attitudes or attributional style, has been supported to be a possible explanation. Studies on childhood adversities and gender role have provided evidence explaining why more girls are depressed than boys. Girls are more likely to experience negative events in the family than boys, and these adversities are in turn associated with elevated depression. Girls identify more strongly with a feminine stereotype of needing to appear thin and consequently become more dissatisfied with their body shape and physical appearance, which in turn is associated with increased depression.",

Even without other incentives to be creative, romantic motives enhanced creativity on subjective and objective measures. For men, any cue designed to activate a short-term or a long-term mating goal increased creative displays; however, women displayed more creativity only when primed to attract a high-quality long-term mate. These creative boosts were unrelated to increased effort on creative tasks or to changes in mood or arousal. Furthermore, results were unaffected by the application of monetary incentives for creativity. These findings align with the view that creative displays in both sexes may be linked to sexual selection, qualified by unique exigencies of human parental investment.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing concern on early initiation of sexual activity among adolescents, increasing sexually transmitted infections, and teenage pregnancy in Uganda. Adolescents perceptions of these sexual behaviors might be the result of discussing sexual and reproductive health issues with key influencing audiences. This study qualitatively explored the effect of sexuality discussions with key influencing audiences by means of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with adolescents (N=83). Findings indicate that adolescence stage comes with changes of intense sexual desires, often presumed difficult to control thus leading adolescents to engage in sexual activities. Adolescents indicated that they were aware of the sexual behaviors such as condom use, contraception use, and multiple concurrent partnerships, but intertwined with persistent myths and misconceptions. Although discussing sexuality issues with someone was found to be instrumental, adolescent highlighted challenges that hinder discussion with key influencers. Challenges include, parents lack of time to talk to their children; some religious affiliations perceived to discourage use of contraception; limited skills of community health workers to address adolescent information needs; meetings held in groups not followed up with age-focused or one-on-one discussions; negative health workers’ attitudes and use of technical language; and peer pressure. These findings suggest the need to provide adequate and updated information to clear any misconceptions and strengthening of key influencers’ communication skills to gain confidence in addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs.",

Although direct and brief behavioral approaches to psychogenic sexual dysfunction began to appear in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Masters and Johnson's work influenced psychotherapeutic approaches to this problem in a manner unprecedented for other psychological disorders. Anxiety is considered to play a role in the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunctions for both men and women by writers of virtually every theoretical persuasion. Unlike sexually functional subjects and organogenically impotent men, psychogenically sexually dysfunctional men consistently underreport sexual arousal. There is a wide agreement among clinicians that several types of cognitive activities have a marked effect on sexual arousal and therefore may play an important role in the genesis and/or maintenance of sexual dysfunction. It is possible that these cognitive activities operate through the mechanism of cognitive interference, or distraction.",

      "abstract": "To verify how conduct disorder and conduct problems are associated with gender, age at onset of drug use and categories of drugs used.A test of association was conducted between the presence of comorbidity and gender. Mean age of first use of each drug was compared to mean age of first arrest, of first robbery/theft, and of first drug dealing.In this sample, approximately 59% of adolescents had already robbed and/or stolen, 38.6% had already been arrested, 32.3% had prior history of drug dealing, 24.1% had depression, and 9.6% had conduct disorder. Prevalence of conduct problems was 65.2%. Tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine were used before the first robbery and/or theft, first drug dealing, and first arrest.The fact that drug use onset preceded illegal acts suggests that the latter are the consequence of the consumption of the former, or perhaps, the consequence of \"social invisibility\" (feeling of not belonging to anything or to anybody) by which these youths undergo.Labeling these youths as conduct-disordered adolescents may cloud a rather different reality, and it may submit them to more social isolation and stigmatization as well.",

El objetivo de esta revision fue sintetizar y analizar los estudios que indagaran sobre dichas percepciones en personas mayores institucionalizadas y residentes en la comunidad. Metodologia: Se elaboro una revision sistematica de estudios cualitativos publicados hasta abril de 2018 en The Cochrane Library, Medline (Pubmed), PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cuiden y CINHAL, tanto en ingles como en castellano. Resultados: Encontramos 1.122 articulos, de los cuales 11 cumplieron los criterios de inclusion. En base a estos articulos, las personas mayores quieren mantener una sexualidad activa. Se consideran barreras para la expresion sexual los estereotipos sociales, la asociacion entre sexualidad y fecundidad/obligacion marital, la falta de intimidad, y los prejuicios de familiares y profesionales. Los hombres mayores gais y bisexuales o las personas con el VIH reflejan como barrera el miedo a revelar su orientacion sexual o alguna enfermedad, respectivamente. Conclusiones: Las personas mayores consideran la sexualidad como algo positivo y como un deseo que siguen queriendo expresar. Los estereotipos sociales, los prejuicios de las personas con las que conviven, la falta de intimidad y la asociacion de la sexualidad con la procreacion o bien con la obligacion marital son consideradas barreras para la expresion de su deseo sexual. Las politicas sociosanitarias deberian tener en cuenta estas consideraciones.",

      "title": "Boys and Girls on the Playground: Sex Differences in Social Development Are Not Stable across Early Childhood",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in human social behaviors and abilities have long been a question of public and scientific interest. Females are usually assumed to be more socially oriented and skilful than males. However, despite an extensive literature, the very existence of sex differences remains a matter of discussion while some studies found no sex differences whereas others reported differences that were either congruent or not with gender stereotypes. Moreover, the magnitude, consistency and stability across time of the differences remain an open question, especially during childhood. As play provides an excellent window into children's social development, we investigated whether and how sex differences change in social play across early childhood. Following a cross-sectional design, 164 children aged from 2 to 6 years old, divided into four age groups, were observed during outdoor free play at nursery school. We showed that sex differences are not stable over time evidencing a developmental gap between girls and boys. Social and structured forms of play emerge systematically earlier in girls than in boys leading to subsequent sex differences in favor of girls at some ages, successively in associative play at 3–4 years, cooperative play at 4–5 years, and social interactions with peers at 5–6 years. Preschool boys also display more solitary play than preschool girls, especially when young. Nevertheless, while boys catch up and girls move on towards more complex play, sex differences in social play patterns are reversed in favor of boys at the following ages, such as in associative play at 4–5 years and cooperative play at 5–6 years. This developmental perspective contributes to resolve apparent discrepancies between single-snapshot studies. A better understanding of the dynamics of sex differences in typical social development should also provide insights into atypical social developments which exhibit sex differences in prevalence, such as autism.",

      "abstract": "Parents describe a want for better sex education for their young children compared to their own myth and silence-led experiences while growing up. However, introducing the vagina has proved a challenging step too far for many parents. This study arose from a secondary qualitative data analysis of 20 focus groups with parents in Ireland about how they engaged in body and sexuality communication and socialisation practices with young children, aged 4 to 9 years old. Though parents often utilised euphemisms, the language applied to male bodies tended to be generic, while euphemisms for female bodies tended to be family-specific. The language used in talking about the female body evaded reference to the vagina and talking about its functions. Protecting the child from knowledge about the sexual body was aligned with maintaining innocence and delaying the child's transition to adulthood. Parents demonstrated a commitment to stop using myths but still placed boundaries around their young children's sex education, albeit boundaries that were being redefined. Perpetuating intergenerational taboos, placing boundaries on knowledge of the sexual body, impacts a child's ability to fully integrate their body into their sense of self.",

What about this woman who is equally attracted to women and men? These are all questions that call for greater insight. The issue of homosexuality is more complicated than it seems.

      "abstract": "\"Little boys play with dump trucks and little girls play with dolls.\" A stereotype for sure, but persistent because children do seem to display sex-based toy preferences, though, of course, some girls prefer dump trucks and some boys prefer dolls. At an early age, these role reversals are often discouraged—girls and boys may be verbally or physically bullied when they don't conform to what other children (and adults) think they should play with. Parental permission must be secured, and in some instances, a parent or guardian may be required to be with the child during the experiment. Another consideration is realizing the natural limitations of children (in terms of boredom, fatigue, energy level, etc.). Hormones may affect toy choices indirectly, perhaps through an influence on activity level, motor skills, abilities, or temperament. Further, natural variations in levels or availability of testosterone among normal males and females might contribute to individual differences in sex-typed behavior.",

Sexual activity is a means for the elderly to affirm physical functioning, to maintain a strong sense of identity and to establish self-confidence. However, not all elderly persons have positive attitudes towards sexuality. Even healthy elderly persons may internalize the stereotypes towards aging. The elderly will be viewed as: • Asexual invalids; • Dirty old men; • Lecherous old women. Negative attitude about masturbation and homosexuality can interfere with sexual expression. Many elderly homosexual persons have not publicly revealed their sexual preference. They may experience additional stress due to a perceived need to hide their sexual orientation.",

The analyzed data suggest that people give a specific meaning to sexual prejudice based on sexual orientation. This meaning is interpreted according to the meaning, justification or assessment of each of those interviewed gave to sexual prejudice. Moreover, the analysis from the perspective of the trajectories identified six milestones or turning points in this development, so-called milestone I, feel in the wrong plane; milestone II, things suddenly began to make sense; Milestone III, is difficult to be gay, lesbian or bisexual; milestone IV, the truth will set you free; V milestone, is a long process and milestone VI, I'm in a very fortunate moment of my life.",

So, to get more knowledge about this issue, a comparative study has been designed on the sample of 100 individuals of age range (18-25) years with the help of Social Anxiety questionnaire for Adults (SAQ-A-30), and this study had been majorly conducted on the adults so as to examine the Gender differences (male/female) in the issue of suffering from social anxiety.

      "abstract": "Children form an essential component of a society. The role of children has been acknowledged key to the survival, development as well as prosperity of that society. A child’s development stage is the most crucial and warrants serious attention from parents and teachers in order to assure their growth into mature adults, who are able to contribute to the society. One of the factors that may hamper their growth is child abuse. There are basically five main forms of child abuse known to take place in Malaysia namely physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect as well as abandonment. These forms of abuse have been given legal attention and recognition except emotional or psychological abuse. One common type of emotional abuse is verbal abuse, which is a form of abusive behavior involving the use of language. Alternatively known as reviling, it is a pattern of behavior that can seriously interfere with one’s positive emotional development and over time, it can lead to significant detriment to one’s self-esteem, emotional well-being and physical state. Although verbal abuse does not leave any outer mark or proof, a verbally abused victim usually suffers by having lower self-worth and low self-esteem. A child, who suffers verbal abuse may grow up to become a low self-esteem adult. Thus, verbal abuse may be considered as grave and must be given serious attention. Laws are the reflection of the attitude of a particular society. Since the function of law is mainly to maintain societal peace and order, it is through law that we can infer how society regards a particular issue, in this regard, verbal abuse on children. This paper aims to highlight firstly, on verbal abuse as another significant form of child abuse needing to be given serious consideration by the society and secondly, on the parameters of child abuse under the Malaysian Child Act 2001; and finally concludes with whether the provisions under the Malaysian Child Act 2001 are sufficient to protect children from verbal abuse.",

      "abstract": "Child marriage is a major social phenomenon in which children and adolescents are abused and exposed. Their rights are violated and they are exposed to both physically and psychologically dangers, since it is a forced marriage between an adult and a minor. It is a disorder where drastically change from a child or teenager to play the role of and adult with a series of responsibilities not suitable for their age. The child not only have to be inserted into adulthood but they also develop as wives or husbands, even in mothers without having reached adulthood or without even knowing what marriage and motherhood implies. Child marriage is a serious violation of the Rights of the Child, and girls are more vulnerable to this situation, as they have to bear the obligation to be both wife and marital rape is increasing when they are in. Leaving childhood and moving into adulthood is not easy, nor is it possible to assimilate from one day to another, so children who suffer from this violation have serious problems developing before society because they are prevented from physical freedom, as well as the ability to decide their future for themselves.",

      "title": "Toward Prevention of Childhood Sexual Abuse: Preschoolers’ Knowledge of Genital Body Parts",
      "abstract": "This study examined preschool children’s knowledge of their genital and non-genital body parts. Results indicated that almost all preschool children knew the correct terms for their non-genital body parts, but few knew the correct terminology for their genitals. The importance of this skill in preventing childhood sexual abuse is discussed. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a serious public health problem. Although definitions vary state by state and in various research programs, CSA is generally defined as sexual contact between a child (under the age of 18) with a person who is at least 5 years older. According to the American Psychological Association (2001), a central characteristic of any abuse is the dominant position of the adult that allows him or her to force or coerce the child into sexual activity. Child sexual abuse may include fondling a child's genitals, masturbation, oral-genital contact, digital penetration, and vaginal and anal intercourse. However, it is not solely restricted to physical contact; such abuse could include non-contact abuse, such as exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography. With close to 100,000 confirmed cases of CSA in the United States during 2005 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007), efforts to prevent CSA are needed. One public health approach to the prevention of CSA offers child-focused personal safety education programs, usually implemented in schools and preschools. The primary focus of most school-based personal safety programs is to strengthen a child’s ability to recognize and resist assault (primary prevention), although they often have a secondary prevention focus as well. The secondary prevention objective is to encourage victims to disclose abuse and to improve adults’ responses to these disclosures so that children can receive early intervention and protection to reduce the negative consequences of sexual exploitation (Wurtele, 1998). Successful disclosure of abusive incidents relies partly on the child’s ability to describe inappropriate activities involving the genitals and to correctly label the genitals. When children disclose CSA using incorrect or idiosyncratic terminology (e.g., “She touched my monkey,” or “He kissed my muffin”), they may not be understood and are thus unlikely to receive a positive, supportive response to their disclosure. In contrast, disclosure using correct terminology is more likely to be understood, resulting in a more positive outcome for a child—e.g., by ending the abusive situation and obtaining therapeutic assistance for the child (Kenny, Thakkar-Kolen, Ryan, Runyon, & Capri, 2008). Furthermore, children who lack sexual knowledge may be more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some sexual offenders avoid children who know the correct names for their genitals because this suggests these children have been educated about body safety and sexuality (Elliot, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995). One convicted offender (who had assaulted 75 children by the time he was stopped) reported that when children knew the correct terms for their different body parts, he would leave them alone (Sprengelmeyer & Vaughan, 2000). Along with facilitating disclosure, teaching proper names for all body parts helps children develop a healthy, positive body image (Wurtele, 1993; Wurtele, Melzer, & Kast, 1992). As Honig (2000) states, it gives children “naming power” (p. 17) just as they have the power to",

Predictors of development of complicated grief after prenatal loss include lack of social support, pre-existing relationship difficulties, or absence of surviving children, as well as ambivalent attitudes or heightened perception of the reality of the pregnancy. Risk of complicated grief was found to be especially high after termination of a pregnancy due to fetal abnormality. Studies have revealed that men and women show different patterns of grief, potentially exacerbating decline in a relationship. Although it is clear that prenatal loss has a large psychological impact, it is concluded that there is a substantial lack of randomized controlled studies in this field of research.",

They may both attempt to rationalize away his behavior as stress reactions related to work or finances, etc. Often the woman believes her adapting behavior will act to control his violence. This tension building phase time lapse varies greatly from the relationship to relationship. For some it may be days or weeks, for others there may be years of tension building between acute incidents. As the tension builds, her coping skills may become less and less effective at protecting herself or de-escalating the tension. It is during this phase that women will often reach out for help or support since they are aware of the increasing danger.

      "title": "[Contraception in adolescence: knowing is not enough].",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is the source of the biological, psychic, and social changes of adolescence. Contraception, by modifying some aspects of sexuality, can change the usual course of adolescence. Sexuality is a new experience for adolescents and is submerged in the same confusion and uncertainty as other areas of their lives. The experience of health personnel in contraception over the years has been gained in prescription for adults, who unlike adolescents are members of stable couples who have found their places in society. Women seeking contraception have usually experienced pregnancy and verified their fecundity, thereby consolidating their identities, unlike the adolescent who is still unsure of her femininity. Contraception for adolescents, by blocking 2 stages in the life of a woman (proving fecundity and experiencing maternity) is an obstacle to the total achievement of adulthood. The connection between sex and pregnancy is recognized by a 13-year-old in a theoretical way, but is not always integrated as a practical reality. Many adults have difficulty accepting the contraception requests of adolescents because they do not feel it is morally right for adolescents to have direct sexual experiences rather than daydreams. The reality of adolescent sexual lives is quite different from what most adults adults imagine it to be. Mental integration of contraception for an adolescent requires acceptance of the link between sex and pregnancy and a mental representation of oneself and one's behavior in which sexuality is considered a possibility. Many adolescents believe that they are too young to become pregnant, or are unable to make the link between sex today and pregnancy in the future, or do not perceive a possible pregnancy in negative terms. After they perceive the need for contraception and develop a desire to meet the need, adolescents must gain knowledge of the different methods available. Choice of a method will be influenced by the degree of efficacy of the method, its cost, facility of use, the frequency of intercourse, secondary effects, social or religious prohibitions, desire to keep contraceptive use secret, and the possibility of involving the partner. Failure to use the chosen means may be caused by such external factors as absence of a nearby family planning center or lack of money, or by internal factors. THe presence of an adult at the contraception consultation may be perceived by the adolescent as a means of control. The consultation may signify to the adolescent a demand for recognition of the reality of his affective and sexual life, a rite of passage, a means of transgressing parental prohibitions, and an indication of acceptance of the dissociation of sexuality from fertility. The presence of the girl's mother can complicate the consultation. Very often the health care professional confuses the role of parent with the medical role, feeling a moral responsibility beyond helping the adolescent avoid pregnancy or abortion. The best course is to be available to listen to the adolescent without prejudice in order to permit the establishment of room for reflection and maturation.",

Es lassen sich zudem deliktspezifische Unterschiede beobachten: Vergewaltiger und Sexualmörder weisen diagnostisch eher Persönlichkeitsstörungen aus dem Cluster B und einen sexuellen Sadismus auf, während Täter mit Kindern als Opfern vermehrt im Cluster C zu finden sind und mit einer Pädophilie diagnostiziert werden.

Younger children reacted in a gender stereotypic manner to peers' gender-linked behavior but did not regulate their own behavior on the basis of personal gender standards. Older children exhibited substantial self-regulatory guidance based on personal standards. They expressed anticipatory self-approval for same-sex typed behavior and self-criticism for cross-sex typed behavior. Their anticipatory self-sanctions, in turn, predicted their actual gender-linked behavior. Neither gender knowledge nor gender constancy predicted gender-linked behavior. These results lend support to social cognitive theory that evaluation and regulation of gender-linked conduct shifts developmentally from anticipatory social sanctions to anticipatory self-sanctions rooted in personal standards.",

      "abstract": "The adequacy of a sex education program for the mentally handicapped has to be judged on an individual basis because of individual characteristics. Sex education is relatively new as it has been promoted since 1956. A sex education program has been in existence in schools in Sweden France and Germany since the 1950s. Its objectives are to provide instruction and information about sexuality anatomy and physiology related to sexuality and interpersonal relations as well as information about the emotional affective and value-related aspects beyond physiology and the functions of the body. Adolescents need a positive role model they can follow and confront. The orientation/limitation and confrontational aspects of the model are important for personality and human development. The educator is impartial but nobody is entirely neutral. The way of transmitting the information is fundamental in its impact on behavior and attitudes and on solving problems rooted in behavior. Sexuality is intimately associated with sexual identification and the sexual role and ultimately with the public expression of sexual identity. In theory a child can adopt the sexual identify of either sex. A child is imprinted with traits of either sex between the 15th and 18th months of life in terms of feelings and emotions. The educator must be free of conflicts concerning his or her sexuality in order to foster an appropriate sexual attitude. Sex education has the objective of furnishing accurate knowledge to help adolescents develop a positive and responsible attitude in the course of their lives. The rehabilitation of mentally handicapped people includes the establishment of a relationship of empathy and respect; psychotherapy in support of counselling; restructuring on a cognitive level especially when body and self-image injury is present; and desensitization and resensitization to develop attitudes for resolving the problems of life.",

      "title": "ASSESSMENT OF SUBJECTIVE SEXUAL EXPERIENCES OF OLDER ADULTS",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is extensive research focusing on sexual dysfunction, decreased frequency, and sexual effects of aging, however few studies explore older adults’ subjective sexual experiences. Consequently, ageist myths prevail that older adults are neither sexually active nor desirous and the quality of their sexual activity must be extremely poor due to dysfunction and older bodies. The aim of this study was to determine how older adults assess their sexual experiences, what aspects are important, and their sexual outlook through survey research with a sample of individuals age 60+ (N=556). The results found older adults are overwhelmingly positive about their sexual experiences along with a realistic recognition of aging effects. Almost all, 85%, are sexually active, partnered and/or solo sex. Satisfaction is high indicated by 45% extremely/very satisfied with both quality and frequency and by a majority rating recent sexual experiences above average on a 1 to 10 scale and a third ranking it as “great sex” (8+). Their positivity is further evidenced as 80% describe their recent sexual experiences as fun and 67% answered exciting, despite 60% also recognizing it is predictable and more challenging, and 72% admitting it’s not their best sex ever. Sexual desire remains high as the majority look forward to their next sexual experience and 70% anticipate an unlimited number of orgasms in their future. Consistent trends were found across all 4 age groups. This study’s findings are significant for reframing the myths and demonstrating that older adults are sexually interested and having overwhelmingly positive sexual experiences.",

      "title": "Experience of early pubertal development: a preliminary analysis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological research in early pubertal development is scant. Much of the directly relevant literature is dated and reflects a tendency to search for 'psychopathology'. Studies have unravelled few long‐term effects on psychological functioning but research findings are inconclusive due to methodological flaws. In the absence of a clear understanding of what is important, it may be helpful to ask those with personal experience what for them is salient about experiences of early pubertal development. This paper offers a preliminary analysis based on interviews with five women whose physical sexual development had begun before the age of seven. Transcripts of the interviews were examined for dominant themes and subjected to a preliminary discursive analysis. The women's accounts revealed implicit social rules that govern childhood, physique, adult–child demarcations and sexuality. Discourses of childhood non‐sexuality and the conflation of feminine appearance with sexual availability intersect to position our participants as sexual anomalies. Self‐perceptions of deviance remained even when peers had caught up in physical development. All of the participants had continued to seek explanations in adulthood, to try and make sense of their 'difference'. Whilst it is too early to draw conclusions from such a small study, our preliminary analysis offers some fresh ideas for formulating future research in the area. Further research is very much needed to clarify how typical the reported experiences are, what factors are associated with them, how these experiences may or may not influence adult sexuality and identity, and how those affected by early pubertal development wish to be supported.

      "abstract": "Sexual desire is often present at the beginning of a romantic relationship. However, research is divided regarding whether, and how, desire is experienced as a relationship progresses. The authors examined relationship duration and its effect on sexual desire in a sample of 170 undergraduate men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that women's sexual desire was significantly and negatively predicted by relationship duration after controlling for age, relationship satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction. Men's sexual desire, however, was not significantly affected by the duration of their romantic relationships. These findings suggest that men and women may have different experiences with sexual desire as relationships progress and that sexual desire might be affected by different factors depending on one's gender. Possible reasons for these results are suggested and therapeutic implications are discussed.",

The data were collected in three specialized Canadian clinics that offer gender-affirming care and they were analyzed through inductive thematic analysis.Results: Two interlinked dimensions of the youth’s lives allow meaning-making of their gender identity: 1) internal or personal and 2) interactional or social processes. Careful analysis reveals three gender identity development pathways that may be taken by youth, from early questioning to the affirmation of their gender identity. A discussion of current models of gender identity development and their limitations concludes the article.",

      "title": "Fertility",
      "abstract": "Fertility refers to the actual production of children, which in the strictest sense is a biological process. A zygote is produced when the sperm of a male and the egg of a female are united, and around nine months later a baby is born. Most often in this process, though not always, a man and a woman have sexual intercourse, the woman conceives, and the conception results in a live birth. Even though the production of a child is a biological process, the various activities and events that lead to the act of sexual intercourse and, later, to giving birth are affected by the social, economic, cultural, and psychological characteristics of the woman and the man, as well as by the environment in which they live. The key to this seeming paradox is that engaging in intercourse, conceiving, and giving birth are themselves behaviors that are influenced by other factors, most of them social and cultural. So while we have no influence at all with regard to the family and parents we receive when we are born, we do have a significant influence on our own fertility, that is, whether or not we produce children, and if so, the number and timing of the children produced. That is, whether we decide to engage in sexual intercourse, whether this intercourse results in a conception, and whether a live birth is the outcome are all driven largely by social and cultural considerations.",

Such interpretation fails to take into account the dynamic processes involved in constructing non-heterosexual identities and to what degree such identities are embodied or disembodied. Supported by interview data among lesbian and gay employees in six British workplaces, this article explores how non-heterosexual identities become known in organizational settings by arguing that lesbians and gay men continue to collide with social expectations and stereotypical ideas of how sexual identities should be ‘worn’ and performed. These expectations and ideas both shape colleagues’ assumptions about their non-heterosexual identities and can expose lesbians and gay men to negative behaviour at work in highly gendered ways.",

Anticipation of discontinuous future events, control of impending events, and positive past events accounted for some age differences found in thinking about distant future time periods.

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual ambivalence can be defined as an experience of sexual behavior as both wanted and unwanted, to some degree, in a particular sexual situation. Despite ambivalence, individuals often decide to participate in these sexual experiences. There are several related and overlapping reasons as to why people ultimately decide to engage in sexual activity, including a history of engaging in a particular sexual behavior or being intimate with a prior partner. There is also evidence to suggest that experiences of sexual violence are related to sexual ambivalence. The present study explored whether prior experience with both a sexual activity and a partner, as well as sexual violence, predicted sexually ambivalent behaviors. Participants were 932 college students who completed a one-time survey about their sexual experiences. Results demonstrated that women were more likely than men to report experiencing sexual ambivalence, and women experienced more ambivalence before, during, and after a sexual encounter. Men were more likely than women to experience ambivalence during and after a sexual activity. A history of sexual violence victimization was associated with experiencing sexual ambivalence prior to engaging in a sexual behavior. Prior experience with a sexual partner or sexual activity was predictive of ambivalence during a sexual encounter, as well as engaging in a sexual activity despite ambivalence. These findings suggest that there are gender differences in sexual ambivalence, and that sexual violence impacts sexual-decision making. We hope these findings can inform sexual violence prevention and sexual education programs.",

Concerning sexual symptoms, female patients suffer much more from a lack of sexual desire and from a deficit in sexually stimulating feelings and sexual pleasure than from insufficient genital functions. The following sexual symptoms are presented: sexual arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, vaginismus, dyspareunia, sexual desire disorders, sexual aversion/sexual phobia. Sex consultation and sex therapy are recommended as preferential treatment options.",

These two interrelated circumstances, namely: the atrophy of the instinct of self-preservation; and the immaturity of apparatuses at birth. This chapter demonstrates that the syndromes of early infantile psychoses, both the autistic as well as the symbiotic type, represent fixations at, or regressions to, the first two developmental stages of \"undifferentiation\" within the early mother–child unity. The pre-symbiotic, normal-autistic phase of the mother-infant unity gives way to the symbiotic phase proper. The symbiotic phase is followed by the so-called separation-individuation phase proper. The symbiotic psychotic syndrome represents fixation at or regression to the second undifferentiated stage of the mother-child unity, which is the stage of delusional omnipotent symbiotic fusion with the need-satisfying object.",

      "title": "Masculinity Unraveled: The Roots of Male Gender Identity and the Shifting of Male Ego Ideals Throughout Life",
      "abstract": "A model of masculine gender identity development is presented that demonstrates how a male's sense of his masculinity and the ambiguities of his gender are being reworked throughout his life. Of factors shaping the boy's sense of masculinity early on, particular emphasis is placed on the role of the involved father, the nature of the parental relationship, and the mother's recognition and affirmation of her son's maleness. While healthy masculine gender identity is founded predominantly on the boy's unique struggles in separating from his mother, it does not result from what has been traditionally viewed as the boy's disidentification from her (and from the feminine more generally). Indeed, boys who need to violently repudiate their identifications with their mother are more susceptible to a fragile, rigid masculine identity and narcissistic psychopathology. A case example of a young adult man illustrates the impact of identifications with both parents. The interplay of early masculine identity development and later life challenges confronting the adult male is briefly noted. “Masculine” ego ideals shift across developmental junctions until, ultimately, a more mature sense of masculinity emerges: the phallic wish to deny differentiation and maintain unlimited possibility is renounced and mourned and certain real limits concerning sex, gender, and generational differences are accepted. This reshaping of the “masculine” ego ideal consequently involves the transformation of a man's previously adaptive “phallicism” into more realistic, “genital” ego ideals—an achievement involving interplay between masculine and feminine identifications and the integration of antithetical elements no longer so unconsciously gendered.",

      "abstract": "In regard to the area of developing object relations, Loewenstein \nand others have related masochism to an early imbalance between \nlibidinal and aggressive components of the infant's early ties to the \nmother. They hypothesized that the child's approaches to the mother \nare met with disapproval or rebuff together with actual or imaginary \nridicule, threat, or punishment. The child then attempts to seduce \nthe aggressor, thereby averting the catastrophe of loss of love. Thus, \nlibidinal attachment becomes intimately associated with aggression, \nleading toward a special type of sexuality. As a result of various types \nof excessive stimulation or other unpleasure induced by the mother, \nthe parent has become the aggressor and the child the protomaso­\nchist in this interchange, and the child's potential for investing \nnormal aggression in the parent has been modified. Does this shift \nlay the basis for the development of masochism, providing a means of \nsurvival against the danger of parental aggression? This protodefense \nmay prevail in all infants but would be exaggerated where the \naggression or anxiety in relation to the mother is more intense than \nusual.",

Previous research has shown that autogynephiles who are principally aroused by images of themselves as nude women are more gender dysphoric than those principally aroused by images of themselves as partially or fully dressed women. This study tested the hypothesis that the feature of the nude self-image most responsible for its correlation with gender dysphoria is the imagined vulva. The subjects were 220 nonhomosexual male outpatients who reported sexual arousal while imagining themselves with one or more features of the female anatomy. Autogynephilia and gender dysphoria were assessed with questionnaires. The findings confirmed that men who are sexually aroused at the thought of having a vulva are more likely to want to be women.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The extent to which a child with autism continues to develop in the same way during his or her life is of the utmost importance to everyone concerned. Autism is characterized by pervasive impairments in social interactions and communication that are manifested in the first 3 years of life. The most compelling question asked by parents at the time of diagnosis, usually when the child is quite young, is whether the child will be able to have a “normal life.” Implicit in this question is the issue of change and continuity-whether the child will ever be able to relate socially to other people, learn to speak and communicate with others, function in dependently, and abstain from the repetitive and stereotyped behaviors that char acterize children with autism. The deficits in social communication that define autism are evidenced to some degree irrespective of intellectual ability (Szatmari et al., 1989). Individual outcomes, however, evince considerable variability, ranging from a very small number of autistic adults who manage to achieve relative normalcy in their level of functioning to the majority who continue to suffer significant impairments throughout their lives. Defining those characteristics of the disorder that tend to remain stable and those that show change represents an ini tial approach toward identifying the extent and nature of plasticity in the development of children with autism.",

Dogs’ inclination to solicit information from humans is in large part a result of the two species’ shared social evolution and niche. Perhaps a more compelling aspect of this relationship is how dogs respond in the face of unexpected, uncertain, and/or novel cues from humans, from whom they frequently solicit information. The influence of human presence on canines’ curiosity about and engagement with their immediate environment is understudied, in part due to challenges in study design. SomeS of these challenges are common to working with and learning from babies of our own species. And, as dogs have developed many mental processes and behaviors similar to preverbal human infants, illuminating strategies for understanding curiosity in babies may prove useful in learning more about how dogs experience the world, with and without people.",

We also sought to identify possible gender differences in the proportions of men and women who have engaged in these unfaithful behaviors while in dating relationships. We examined 219 college men's and women's reported involvement in sexual behaviors, romantic attachments, sexual and nonsexual fantasies, sexual attraction, romantic attraction, flirting, and social participation in dyads and groups with someone other than their current or past dating partner. A sizable proportion of both men and women reported engaging in one or more of the behaviors at some point in their dating history. Proportionately more men than women indicated having engaged in sexual fantasies of various types about someone other than their primary partner and reported \"hitting on\" someone else while in a dating relationship. No other gender differences emerged. A unique aspect of this study is that we asked young men and women to determine what kinds of behaviors they considered to be unfaithful rather than only examining sexual and emotional behaviors as has been the case in past research. Further, the few significant gender differences we found indicates that the convergence of men's and women's attitudes about sexuality may now be show in their behavior.",

      "title": "Developing Sensitivity to Complex Facial Expressions in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "The ability to produce and interpret facial expressions enables humans to communicate vital information in reciprocal social exchanges. In the first years of life, human infants begin to develop the ability to perceive and categorize basic emotional expressions (e.g. happy, sad, angry); however, these abilities continue to improve throughout childhood and into adolescence. Interestingly, very little is known about the developmental trajectory of sensitivity to more socially complex emotional expressions such as resentment, envy, or contempt. Importantly, the research that does exist has been conducted almost exclusively in atypical populations. In this project, we hypothesized that adolescence would be a key period for the emergence of sensitivity to socially complex expressions, largely because a subset of these expressions tend to provide signals about the status of more intimate relationships (i.e., with sexual and romantic partners and/or competitors) that adolescents are only beginning to form with their peers. We also hypothesized that sensitivity to these complex expressions would be fundamentally related to pubertal maturation, which likely influences the motivation to form more intimate, romantic, and sexual relationships in adolescence. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted two experiments to measure developmental changes in perceptual sensitivity to detect both basic (e.g., happy) and complex emotional expressions in four groups: pre-pubescent children (ages 6-8), adolescents in early versus later stages of pubertal development (ages 11-14), and sexually mature adults (ages 20-25). We report several age-related changes from childhood to adulthood as well as puberty-related changes in the absence of age-related changes from early pubertal development to late pubertal development.",

      "title": "Why is absent/low sexual desire a mental disorder (except when patients identify as asexual)?",
      "abstract": "This analytic essay challenges the psychiatric practice of treating absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal as a mental disorder. It does so by calling attention to the fact that asexuality is treated differently than other non-heterosexual orientations. The current DSM contains no psychiatric diagnosis which has, as its primary symptom, same-sex sexual desire. Yet, the same DSM offers diagnoses such as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual interest/arousal disorder which have, as their primary symptom, absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal. One of the unfortunate consequences of treating absent/low sexual desire as a mental disorder is that it perpetuates the false belief that those who experience their sexuality differently than the heterosexual ‘sexusociety’ norm are less healthy and more dysfunctional. It is also troubling because of the implied gender bias: women are more likely to experience absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal than men and more likely to be diagnosed with a sexual interest/desire/arousal disorder. Women’s sexual desires, or the absence thereof, are, thus, more likely to be seen as abnormal. Since that judgment has long been used to pressure women to engage in sex they do not want, the unavoidable inference is that the psychiatric tradition of diagnosing absent/low sexual desire as pathological has placed, and continues to place, women at greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. The remedy: stop treating absent/low sexual desire as pathological. Recognize that people are sexually different and are entitled to desire sex a lot, a little, or not at all—whatever feels right for them.",

Personality traits may become unstable during stages of ontogeny from infancy to adulthood, especially during major periods of development such as around the time of sexual maturation. The personality of domesticated farm animals has links with productivity, health and welfare, but to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the development and stability of personality traits across developmental life stages in a mammalian farm animal species. Here, we describe the consistency of personality traits across ontogeny in dairy cattle from neonate to first lactation as an adult. The personality traits 'bold' and 'exploratory', as measured by behavioural responses to novelty, were highly consistent during the earlier (before and after weaning from milk) and later (after puberty to first lactation) rearing periods, but were not consistent across these rearing periods when puberty occurred. These findings indicate that personality changes in cattle around sexual maturation are probably owing to major physiological changes that are accelerated under typical management conditions at this time. This work contributes to the understanding of the ontogeny of behaviour in farm animals, especially how and why individuals differ in their behaviour.",

Three hypotheses regarding gender differences in subjective distress to sexual and emotional infidelity, and in the inferences linking the infidelities were tested. The results indicated that more men than women were distressed by imagining a partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with another person, and more women than men were distressed by imagining a partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person. Asking another group of women and men to imagine a partner committing both infidelities at the same time, and then to indicate which component of the combined infidelity was the most distressing, produced the same sexual asymmetries. The prediction that men will infer from a partner's sexual infidelity the co-occurrence of emotional infidelity and that women will infer from a partner's emotional infidelity the co-occurrence of sexual infidelity was not supported. An evolutionary perspective, rather than an alternative analysis emphasizing the different inferences men and women draw from sex and love, provided a satisfactory explanation of the sexual asymmetries in the cues to jealousy.",

An individual's sexual behaviour can have a profound impact on the person's sexuality regardless of how this behaviour occurs, be it masturbation in isolation or penetrative intercourse with a partner. Sex per say is not always done with an aim for procreation [1]. The individual's propensity for sex can be both procreative and non-procreative. The degree of inclination and the extent of engagement in the act though will depend on the individual's society, his/her culture, upbringing, religious beliefs/taboos, other people's expectation and opportunities [2]. What constitutes a normal sexual behaviour? There is no straightforward answer. What may be normal in one culture/society may be abnormal in another. The definition of 'normalcy' is driven by society and/or cultural values, and the extent of 'deviance' is also influenced by the same. Furthermore the 'degree of deviance' in some sexual behaviours can be quantified by comparing with already established norms, but this is not possible for all sex-related behaviours and conditions [3].",

      "abstract": "The friendship status of a recipient was taken into consideration with respect to the sharing patterns of third grade children. Subjects were found to share significantly more candies initially with a friend than a desired friend or nonfriend peer* A variety of psychological phenomenon determined the second sharing after the receipt of a large, small, or equal amount of candy from the previous recipent. Children increased their sharing to a desired friend after friendly overtures from him (her) and retaliated small donations by an established friend with decreased sharing. In still more neutral conditions, the children followed a norm of equality that was introduced into the experimental situation. Subsequent sharing with a needy child was related neither to feeling good nor to feeling guilty. Also subjects did not respond differently in the experimental conditions because of sex. Finally highly popular children followed more reciprocal patterns of sharing than other children, and were more susceptible to modeling influences",

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria and Transvestism in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Schizophrenia and gender dysphoria have been linked in certain studies, but this is controversial. Transsexualism and schizophrenia, however, can coexist.[1,2] About 20–25% of people with schizophrenia have sex change delusions.[3] People with schizophrenia may experience gender dysphoria as a result of a delusional shift in gender identity or it may develop independently of psychotic symptoms. Making a distinction between these cases is difficult from a diagnostic standpoint as well as from a therapeutic perspective. A 40-year-old unmarried male from a lower socioeconomic class from an urban background with no family history of psychiatric illness and a well-adjusted premorbid personality but with a past 10 years history as a known case of paranoid schizophrenia was brought to psychiatry out-patient department (OPD) after a drug drop out. He presented with complaints of the belief that he was in the wrong body and identified himself as a transsexual, suspicious toward transsexuals that they have done this to him, shyness while talking to males and distressed due to the same, worrying thoughts about his sexual orientation, and why was he not normal like other males. Mental status examination revealed a middle-aged male dressed in women's clothes, sitting cross-legged and lip gesturing with a mood conveyed as sad with distressed affect with delusions of persecution with lack of insight and impaired judgment. He was restarted on olanzapine 20 mg on which his psychotic symptoms resolved. He was also started on fluoxetine 40 mg to which his mood showed improvement, He was psycho-educated about gender identity but was unable to accept his gender dysphoria, constantly denied, blamed the transsexuals, and considered himself a heterosexual. He showed partial improvement, psychotic symptoms reduced significantly, his confusion about his sexual orientation, and dysphoria still persists. Acceptance of gender incongruence has begun to be seen after the onset of therapy. In this case, despite the presence of delusion of sex change, there were a lot of behavioral changes like shying away when talking to males, uncomfortable in one's own body, unwillingness to marry a woman, and presence of constant denial about his biological sexual orientation, which suggested significant gender dysphoria. In this case report, gender dysphoria symptoms were present long before schizophrenia symptoms appeared, and the latter condition seemed to improve after counseling and therapy. This may imply that the belief in sex change associated with gender dysphoria is a rather stable one and that the schizophrenia symptoms are merely a florid amplification of the trait. However, whether the transvestism was a result of schizophrenia or gender dysphoria, still remains a diagnostic dilemma. However, reports of transvestism with psychosis are extremely rare.[4,5] Gender dysphoria and transvestism comorbid with schizophrenia are extremely rare and still remain a diagnostic dilemma because of the presence of sexual delusions in the course of paranoid schizophrenia itself.

      "abstract": "Liminal identity is a problem faced by adolescence. Liminal events occur due to the reluctance of parents to share adolescent experiences with teenagers in the family. In addition to the transition period, the most noticeable development in adolescence is its physical growth. Physical growth is accompanied by an active hormone that influences the curiosity of adolescents about physical changes, psychological, and biological desires. This study aims to understand the construction of identity and sexual expression of adolescents in Semarang. This research employed descriptive qualitative research. The results of the study indicate that an inappropriate distribution of adolescents’ curiosity brings great consequences during adolescence period. Many adolescents express themselves by having sex outside of marriage and other sexual behaviors. This occurs as a result of wrong association and inaccurate distribution of curiosity. Misconceptions of adolescent behavior also happen due to misconceptions and miss-adaptation of the environment. The behavior is heavily influenced by their environment where they grow and develop, especially in the urban environments which are very complex due to global dynamics.",

      "title": "Psychological Assessment and Therapy for the Spinal-Cord-Injured Patient",
      "abstract": "Disorders of sexual function occur frequently in patients with spinal cord injury, but have not until very recently been studied in a systematic fashion. The frequent occurrence of this disorder is clearly related to the fact that the sexual organs are directly controlled by components at all levels of the nervous system, ranging from the peripheral nerves to the cerebral hemispheres. In addition, it must be emphasized that sexuality is not just a biologic function, but also has complex psychological and social aspects. The work of ethnologists, such as Lorenz (25), has shown this to be true for most animal species. In humans, this aspect of sexuality appears to be particularly important. Small children, when asked to identify themselves, often respond by saying, \"I'm a boy\" or \"I'm a girl,\" their gender providing a source of personal identification. Frequently, how well individuals perform sexually determines how much of a \"man\" or a \"woman\" they see themselves to be. Given this system of beliefs with respect to the emphasis on sexuality and sexual performance, a great deal of anxiety becomes attached to situations in which sexual behavior is expected. These added meanings and expectations impart considerable importance to sexual behavior and have contributed to the fact that human sexuality consists of much more than reproductive function. These factors may help explain why sexual functions are highly vulnerable to all types of severe and chronic diseases, particularly diseases of the nervous system, which so frequently disrupt motor behavior.",

Over three‐quarters (76%) of the respondents indicated they were considered special or had a definite role as children within the family of origin. Those given special treatment most often attributed it to their birth order, scholastic achievement, condition of health, or display of talents. Family members expressed this specialness by bestowing an abundance of attention, love, and caring. Many participants reported having roles within the family or designated epithets such as \"the bookworm,\" \"the brain,\" or \"the responsible one.\" When respondents believed that a sibling held a special position, the reasons provided were less often related to achievements and abilities. Brothers were reported as being special due to their gender or health; sisters because of their talent, beauty, charm or delicateness.",

      "title": "Some Considerations About Sexual Abuse and Children with Sexual Behavior Problems",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY In the mid 1980s treatment programs for children twelve years and younger who molested other children began to appear. There was little known about these children and there were numerous misconceptions about this population. It was believed that the primary etiological factor in the development of this behavior was previous hands-on sexual abuse to the child. It was also believed that a majority of sexually abused children would engage in problematic sexual behaviors and that it was quite likely that they would go on to molest others. In the intervening years a great deal has been learned about children who molest. The diversity of reasons for the development of problematic sexual behavior has been researched. Another important finding is that there is a range of disturbed sexual behaviors in children. This is important as there has been an overidentification of children who engage in problematic sexual behaviors as children who are molesting. A continuum of sexual behaviors in children is described which delineates three groups of children who engage in problematic sexual behavior, only one of which is molesting other children. With this understanding professionals can distinguish between children who engage in natural and healthy sexual behaviors, sexually-reactive behaviors, extensive but mutual sexual behaviors, and children who molest. This assists in more accurate assessment and treatment planning in an era in which children can be placed on sex offender registries and potentially be subject to community notification.",

      "abstract": "Within recent years several human ova in the previllous stage of development have been discovered and their study, taken in conjunction with the detailed observations of Heuser and Streeter (1941) on the development of the macaque embryo, has resulted in fundamental modifications of the views previously held concerning the early development of the human embryo. The outlook on early human embryology comprises three phases: first, the phase when only very few specimens had been discovered and the tentative conclusions drawn from their study were to a considerable extent merely surmised by analogy with the phenomena known to occur in the development of other animals; second, the phase where sufficient material has been acquired to enable investigators to verify or deny some of these postulations and even to suspect certain possibilities—like variations in the degree of development of the various elements in embryos of approximately the same age such as is known to occur in other mammals, or early histological changes indicating pathological relations between the embryonic and maternal structures which may foreshadow the failure of continued embryono-maternal relations and impending abortion; and third, a phase when the specimens will be so numerous that the conclusions of the earlier periods can be established with certainty or definitely refuted. At present, early human embryological study is in the second phase, and the early attainment of the third phase is desirable to fill gaps in the present knowledge of the stages in the development of several structures ( e.g. the yolk-sac, the amnio-embryonic vesicle, etc.) and to determine details necessary for a more precise comparison of the development of the human ovum with that of other primate and of lower vertebrate forms.",

      "abstract": "Problem behavior may be defined as behavior that is socially defined as a problem, a source of concern, or as undesirable by the norms of conventional society and the institutions of adult authority, and its occurrence usually elicits some kind of social control response. Key elements of problem behavior are: (1) problem behaviors are rare until early adolescence; (2) the rate then climbs to a peak level; (3) thereafter the problem behavior becomes less frequent for the remainder of the lifespan (unless it ceases to be seen as a problem behavior), and (4) the timing of these trends is different for different problem behaviors in respects such as the typical age of initiation and the rate and timing of decline. Problem behavior varies with age because of social norms that children be given increasing independelice as they grow older. At each age, tl'ose adolescents who are less closely supervised are more likely to engage in problem behavior. Also relevant to this point is research that time spent socializing with peers in informal settings, away from adult supervision, is related to problem behavior. The question that remains is whether the relationship between independence and problem behavior, combined with the similarity in their age trends, is sufficient to account for age trends in problem behavior.

      "abstract": "American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people experience the highest rates of homicide and violence in the USA and Canada.1 This propensity for violence and sexual crimes has manifested as the crisis referred to as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, with more than 5000 young women having suffered homicide, kidnapping or trafficking in the USA.2 AI children are not exempt from these statistics. When compared to non-AI populations there is a statistically significantly higher proportion of AI/AN reporting of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.3 This same disparity is also true regarding emotional and physical neglect.3 Abuse and violence affect all communities, but as paediatric providers, many of the patients we treat lack the vocabulary, maturity or both to express their needs, rendering them particularly vulnerable. These conversations can be difficult, especially when there is fear that the questions asked might alienate or offend the families we are trying to serve. Medical trainees are often uncomfortable in screening for child abuse, particularly, during encounters where the signs are subtle or unrelated to the chief complaint. Medical schools and residency programmes often lack the curriculum needed to educate trainees on how to approach suspected abuse cases or the resources available to families.4 Additionally, the lack of a standardised approach to survey for abuse further complicates effective recognition and management. However, evidence suggests that residents who learn to address family psychosocial issues, including violence and abuse, are more likely to screen for these issues in practice and ultimately connect patients with needed resources.4 Several validated screening tools, including the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (IPSCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) and Escape Form have demonstrated effectiveness at screening children for abuse.5, 6 The Escape Form evaluates risk based on the patient's history, the development of the child, the appropriateness of interaction between the child and caretakers, the consistency of the physical examination compared with the history, if there was a delay in seeking care and other safety concerns.6 Results from this form provide an ‘at-risk score’ that creates an objective manner of evaluation that can allow for consistency in evaluation. Review of this model has demonstrated an increase in abuse screening, trainee comfort with screening and most importantly, an increase in detection of cases that is five times higher when compared to cases of children that were not screened.6 The American Academy of Pediatrics offers several resources through ‘The Resilience Project’ aimed at addressing violence and toxic stress at both the medical practice and policy levels.7 This online resource provides tools for families, care givers and providers who treat children and youth exposed to violence.7 The implementation of the ‘Training Toolkit’ may prove valuable to trainees and early career physicians, helping them to learn the different types of violence that our paediatric patients may experience. The expanding education on patient and family-centred communication throughout clinical training may better equip future paediatricians to identify abuse and develop the confidence to start the appropriate dialogue to curb its effects. This national crisis of violence against AI/AN women and girls challenges paediatricians to find ways to address the gap in protecting girls from becoming the missing and the murdered. Screening both for abuse and family wellness is a critical step for paediatricians in addressing this crisis. Gaining the confidence to implement these skills can be undoubtedly challenging. Structured teaching and guidance can empower residents to identify abuse and will be a life-changing event for trainees and the families we treat.",

It has been increasingly recognized that the dental surgeon may be the first professional to suspect physical abuse, especially in relation to injuries involving the orofacial structures.3 A child is considered to have been abused if he or she is treated in a way that is unacceptable in a given culture at a given time.4 For the purposes of this review, only physical abuse in the form of NAI and neglect will be considered. Neglect occurs when an adult knowingly allows a child to endure pain or suffering or fails to provide the basic requisites for proper maturation.",

In the past, when the principal treatment for ED was penile prosthesis implantation, the distinction between psychogenic and organic or mixed ED was of considerable importance. Since many of today's treatment options are nonsurgical, this distinction is less critical. For men who are contemplating surgical treatment, such as penile prosthesis implantation, however, it is still desirable to exclude temporary or potentially reversible forms of erectile impairment, such as psychogenic ED. Erectile dysfunction must also be distinguished from other sexual disorders, such as decreased libido, premature or retarded ejaculation, painful erections or orgasm, and erectile deformity. Of course, any of these disorders may coexist.",

      "abstract": "This study tests the firm distinction children are said to make between living and nonliving kinds. Three, 4‐, and 5‐year‐old children and adults reasoned about whether items that varied on 3 dimensions (alive, face, behavior) had a range of properties (biological, psychological, perceptual, artifact, novel, proper names). Findings demonstrate that by 4 years of age, children make clear distinctions between prototypical living and nonliving kinds regardless of the property under consideration. Even 3‐year‐olds distinguish prototypical living and nonliving kinds when asked about biological properties. When reasoning about nonbiological properties for the full range of items, however, even 5‐year‐olds and adults occasionally rely on facial features. Thus, the living/nonliving distinction may have more narrow consequences than previously acknowledged.",

      "abstract": "The present study aims to determine whether homosexual behavior in stump-tailed macaque males of different age groups were socio-sexual or sexually motivated. Male homosexual encounters were divided into two categories for analysis; manual genital stimulation and actual mounting. Manual genital stimulation in adult males occurred bidirectional, in the context of social affiliations. There was no significant difference between dominant and subordinate partners in terms of genital stimulation performed or received. Mounting was in double foot-clasp position similar to heterosexual encounter. We identified three types of mounts. All types of mounts occurred unidirectional among adult males and mostly occurred in aggressive context. Unique homosexual encounters was observed between α-male and β-male where mounting involved anal intromission terminated by ejaculation and occurred only during the mating season after the heterosexual copulation between β-male and estrous female, which was known to be sexually motivated. We examined several socio-sexual explanations for male homosexual mounting, including (1) dominance-assertion (2) tension-regulation (3) reconciliation and (4) practice for heterosexual copulation. Homosexual encounters between adult males interpreted: a strict relationship between dominant individuals mounting subordinate individuals, reconciliation attempted by the subordinate; and the mechanism employed to regulated aggression and reestablished social bond among adult males. Mounting among immature males occurred bidirectional. Five evidences indicated the homosexual mounting between immature males as socio-sexual behavior. The evidences based on: (a) the mating season (b) the same day heterosexual encounter (c) assistance provided by adult male to immature males (d) occurrence in the context of play (e) immature males in homosexual mounting and learning heterosexual mounting with adult females. The male-male homosexuality adds a new dimension in sexual behavior of stump-tailed macaque.",

      "title": "TINJAUAN HUKUM ISLAMTERHADAP HAK ASUH (HADANAH) BAGI ANAK HASIL HUBUNGANINCEST",
      "abstract": "Secara epistimologis, incest (zina dengan saudara) didefinisikan sebagai\r\nrelasi-relasi seksual di antara orang-orang berbeda jenis kelamin yang berkaitan\r\ndarah dekat sekali lewat ikatan darah, atau hubungan seks di antara pria dan\r\nwanita di dalam atau di luar ikatan perkawinan, di mana mereka terkait dalam\r\nhubungan kekerabatan/keturunan yang dekat sekali. Beberapa tahun terakhir ini\r\nbanyak terdengar dari berbagai media terjadinya kekerasan terhadap anak yang\r\nbanyak dilakukan orang terdekat, yang merupakan keluarga mereka sendiri,\r\ndimana umumnya anak lebih merupakan korban perkosaan. Korban tidak boleh\r\nmenikah dengan orang yang menghamilinya yang dalam hal ini adalah ayah atau\r\nsaudara kandungnya sendiri karena dalam Islam dikenal istilah mahram (orangorang\r\nyang haram dinikahi). Sedangkan dari kacamata medis, perkawinan incest\r\ntidak dianjurkan karena dikhawatirkan akan menimbulkan akibat medis pada\r\nketurunan selanjutnya. Persoalan yang timbul adalah bagaimana jika anak yang\r\ndikandung oleh korban incest tersebut ternyata terlahir dalam keadaan hidup dan\r\nsehat, karena belum tentu anak yang dilahirkan dari hasil hubungan incest akan\r\nterlahir cacat atau meninggal. Berdasarkan hal tersebut, penyusun ingin\r\nmengangkat dan menganalisa dua pokok permasalahan, yaitu bagaimana status\r\nnasab anak dari hasil hubungan incest dan tinjauan hukum Islam terhadap hak\r\nasuh (hadanah) bagi anak hasil hubungan incest.\r\nPendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan\r\nnormatif, yaitu pendekatan yang dimaksudkan untuk menyelidiki secara\r\nmendalam ketentuan-ketentuan doktrinal dari nash al-Qur’an maupun hadis Nabi\r\ndikaitkan dengan pendapat ulama maŜhab khususnya maŜhab Syāfi’ī, tentang\r\nmasalah hak asuh anak hasil hubungan incest. Penelaahan secara normatif\r\ndilakukan dengan meneliti secara runtut argumentasi dan pertimbangan hukum\r\nyang digunakan dalam menentukan hak asuh bagi anak hasil hubungan incest\r\nberdasarkan norma-norma hukum Islam dan kaidah mas}lah}ah mursalah.\r\nHasil dari penelitian ini adalah bahwa status anak hasil incest sama dengan\r\nstatus anak zina. Imam Hanafi maupun asy-Syāfi’ī sepakat bahwa nasab anak zina\r\ntidak dinisbatkan kepada pasangan ibunya, tetapi dinisbatkan kepada ibunya.\r\nSelain itu, dalam Kompilasi Hukum Islam juga disebutkan bahwa anak yang lahir\r\ndi luar perkawinan hanya mempunyai nasab dengan ibunya dan keluarga ibunya.\r\nDengan dasar untuk menarik maslahat dan dengan seizin dari ibu dan keluarga ibu\r\nsi anak, maka ayah sekaligus kakek sang anak hasil incest dimungkinkan untuk\r\nmengasuhnya, begitu juga dengan kasus incest yang terjadi dengan saudara lain\r\nyang masih mahram, di mana sang ibu dan keluarga ibu tidak mampu memenuhi\r\nkebutuhan pemeliharaan sang anak, maka ayah biologisnya dapat membantu\r\npemeliharaannya, karena meskipun orang tua dari anak hasil hubungan incest\r\ntidak diperbolehkan menikah dalam hukum Islam, namun mereka tetap harus\r\nbertanggung jawab atas pengasuhan dan pemeliharaan anak. Keputusan untuk\r\nmenyerahkan pengasuhan anak korban incest kepada ayahnya adalah berdasarkan\r\npertimbangan tersebut di atas, dan jika dilihat dari sudut pandang maqasid asysyari’\r\nah, hal ini sesuai dengan kemaslahatan sebagai tujuan dari dibentuknya\r\nhukum Islam.",

The notable findings are as follow: First, the emotional maturation of married women increases marital sexual autonomy, and this phenomenon is further enhanced through the perception of sexual inequality as a medium. In the case of married men, it is found that emotional maturity does not directly affect marital sexual autonomy, but can increase sexual autonomy by mediating self-perception and sexual inequality. This is common to both married men and married women over 45 years of age.",

      "abstract": "Beyond the well‐known ethical issues involved in medical experimentation on human subjects, experimenting with embryos raises unique and particularly hard problems. Beside the psychological obstacles connected with the fear of ‘‘playing God\" and the awe with which we hold the process of the creation of human beings, there are three philosophical problems which are the main subject of the article: 1. The logical problem of circularity: the morality of experimenting on embryos is dependent on the status of the embryo, which in turn is partly decided by experimentation. 2. The metaphysical problem: experiments are justified by the benefits they bring to human subjects; but it is doubtful whether an early embryo is a ‘‘subject\" and whether coming into being is a ‘‘benefit\". 3. The moral problem: the standard constraint on medical experiments is that they benefit either the individual subject or at least members of a relevantly defined group of patients suffering from the same syndrome. But embryo experimentation is often associated with potential cure to people of a completely different category (like geriatric patients). Finally, the article discusses the limits of the force of philosophical arguments in the formation of actual policies for regulating such practices as experimenting with embryos. The widely‐shared fourteen‐day limit is shown to be a sound practical compromise despite the difficulties in justifying it philosophically.",

      "title": "I love you with all my brain: laying aside the intellectually dull sword of biological determinism",
      "abstract": "Background : By organizing and activating our passions with both hormones and experiences, the heart and mind of sexual behavior, sexual motivation, and sexual preference is the brain, the organ of learning. Despite decades of progress, this incontrovertible truth is somehow lost in the far-too-often biologically deterministic interpretation of genetic, hormonal, and anatomical scientific research into the biological origins of sexual motivation. Simplistic and polarized arguments are used in the media by both sides of the seemingly endless debate over sexual orientation, equality, and human rights with such catch phrases as ‘born gay’ contrasted against attempts of “reparative therapy” or “pray the gay away”. Though long abandoned in practically every other area of psychology, this remnant of the nature-nurture controversy remains despite its generally acknowledged insufficiency in explaining any adult aspect of the human condition within the scientific community. Methods : This article identifies three factors: 1) good intentions with regard to the argument from immutability; 2) false dichotomies limiting intellectual progress by oversimplification of theory and thus hypothesis, and most dangerously, interpretation and; 3) Tradition: a historical separation of the disciplines of biology and psychology, which, to this day, interferes with the effective translation of well-conducted science into good public understanding and policy. Results : Studies clearly demonstrate that progress toward sexual-orientation equality is being made, if slowly, despite the apparent irrelevance of the “born gay” argument from immutability. Evidence is further provided supporting the inadequacy of polarized, dichotic theories of sexual development, particularly those pitting “blank slate learning” against a fated, deterministic biological perspective. Results of this review suggest that an emerging interactionist perspective will promote both better scientific progress and better public understanding, hopefully contributing to progress toward nondiscriminatory public policy. Conclusion : Accepting that the brain is a highly plastic, modularly dimorphic, developmentally biased organ of learning, one which is organized and activated by both hormones and experiences across the lifespan, is essential for doing ‘good science’ well. Interactionist theories of psychosexual development provide an empirically sound, strong, yet modifiable foundation for testable hypotheses exploring biologically biased sexual learning.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents are one-third of the country’s population and dealing with adolescents is not a child’s play. According to the WHO, around 1.2 billion people, or 1 in 6 of the world’s population, are adolescents aged 10–19. Adolescence is the second growth spurt of life and poses lots of challenges for the adolescent, parents, and caregivers. It marks a transition characterized by physical, emotional, and social changes. It is one of the most crucial and challenging periods of life with peak intelligence and stamina. The physical changes that herald adolescence are – the development of breasts, axillary and pubic hair, and first menstrual periods for girls and deepening of voice and broadening of shoulders for boys, which are the most striking markers of this stage. Developing brains bring new cognitive skills that enhance their reasoning ability and abstract thinking but these changes occur few years later than the physical development which brings in challenges for the adolescents and their caregivers. Adolescents develop cognitively, physically, socially, and emotionally. It prepares them to experiment with new behaviors. There is a high chance of adolescents getting into smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse. Changing sexuality predisposes for early unprotected and premarital sex. Some of the reasons for high- risk behavior in adolescents includes Living in increasingly sexualized societies, impact of media, rapid growth of cities, and breakdown of traditional family structure. HEADSS criteria are the best way to assess the characteristics of an adolescent (1) H – Home, (2) E - Education and employment, (3) A – Activity, (4) D – Drugs, (5) S – Sexuality, (6) S – Suicide/depression. Adolescents (20%) are important asset to our nation. Pediatricians with a little training can deal with the adolescent in a comfortable way.",

      "title": "The Prevalence of Perimenstrual Distress among Sri Lankan Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Adolescent development is a period of transitions that involves biological, psychological and social changes. According to Hill (1983), there are 3 features of adolescent development which involve biological, cognitive and social transition.Cognitive transitionCompared to children adolescents think in ways that are more advanced, more efficient and generally more complex. According to Piaget final stage of cognitive development in one's life span is believed to emerge during adolescence. It is characterised by abstract, idealistic and logical thoughts.Social transitionThe most noteworthy aspect of social transition in adolescence includes increase in the amount of time adolescents spend with their peers, intensified need for intimacy and emergence of sexual and romantic relationships. (Steinberg, 2002.)Biological transitionAs described by Tanner (1989) five important physical changes are evident during puberty in the case of girls. These are breast, pubic and auxiliary hair growth, growth in height and menstruation.Menstruation is the visible manifestation of cyclic physiological uterine bleeding. The shedding of the endometrium takes place due to invisible interplay of hormones mainly through hypothalamus, pituitary ovarian axis (Dutta, 2007). The first menstruation (menarche) occurs between the ages of 11 to 15 years with a mean of 13 years. (Padubidiri & Daftary 2004).Psychological transitionHost of psychological changes accompany adolescent's pubertal development. (Sarigiani & Petersen 2000; Susman & Rogol, 2004). Many psychological problems emerge as a result of inability to understand the anatomical morphological and psychological changes expected during adolescence.For an adolescent girl, getting her 1st period is a physical milestone. But it can be confusing and scary, particularly if she encounters certain problems like dysmenorrhoea or Pre Menstrual Syndrome (PMS).DysmenorrhoeaDysmenorrhoea means painful cramping pain accompanying menstruation. Primary dysmenorrhoea refers to one that is not associated with any identifiable pelvic pathology. The pathogenesis of pain attributed to biochemical imbalances. Secondary dysmenorrhoea refers to the one associated with the presence of organic pelvic pathology, i.e. fibroids, PID, endometriosis. Primary dysmenorrhoea is widely prevalent; more than 70% of teenagers suffer from varying degrees of discomfort. Both the local and systematic symptoms are apparently the result of increased levels of prostaglandins in the menstrual fluids. This results in uterine cramping, nausea, vomiting, backache, diarrhoea, giddiness, syncope and fainting. (Padubidiri & Daftary 2004.)Pre Menstrual SyndromeAlthough the concept of physical and menstrual distress in the premenstrual phase has been recognized in the earliest medical writing, it was not delineated as a clinical entity until 1931. Pre menstrual tension was the name given by Frank to describe the distressing psychological or physiological symptoms which some women experience regularly towards the end of each menstrual cycle and which significantly regress throughout the rest of the cycle (Talyor, Green & Stout, 2004).Review of Related StudiesFreeman et al., (1993) examined the relationship between premenstrual symptoms, dysmenorrhoea and emotional distress factors in a sample of 165 females, aged 15-19 years. Premenstrual symptoms were correlated with dysmenorrhoea (r = 0.54, p",

The definition excludes the persons suspected of committing an offence and the persons that show a sexual behavior socially undesirable or deviated, but not precisely offencing. The youthful sexual offenders are the ones criminally sentenced for a sexual offence, considered to have discrimination for this kind of sentence, but not having the age for being criminally investigated and punished like adults. The researches underline the need of understanding the offencing sexual behaviour in the context of early life experiences and family experiences, and also in the context of some power relationships or authority between the aggressor and his victim. The article resumes current dates concerning the sexual offences committed by adults, comparing them with the few knowledge about the youthful sexual offenders (similarities and differences). We conclude with suggestions for possible strategies of evaluation and treatment. românaInfractiunile sexuale sunt cele nominal sexuale si cele cu intentie sau componenta sexuala.

      "title": "Libido Boosting Functional Foods",
      "abstract": "Libido is a sexual desire or drive. Libido is biological desire’s emotional energy, especially sexual desire. Biopsychosocial variables affect libido. Biologically, sex hormones and nucleus accumbent neurotransmitters (mainly testosterone and dopamine) govern human desire. Working, family, mentality, and stress might affect libido. Medical disorders, drugs, lifestyle, relationships, and age might affect libido (e.g., puberty). Hypersexuality is having frequent or suddenly increased sexual impulses; hyposexuality is the opposite. In psychoanalytic thought, libido is a mental drive or energy, connected with sexual instinct but is also present in other innate urges. A man may want sex but not be able to act on it, or may not for medical, moral, or religious reasons. Repressing or sublimating an urge is psychological. One can participate in sexual activity without a sire. Stress, illness, and pregnancy affect sperm drive. Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and norepinephrine act as serotonin This book chapter talks about how functional foods such as spinach, dark chocolate, peppers, green tea, oysters, crab, and pumpkin seeds, which contain neurotransmitters, affect libido.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) with or without other anomalies is a common referral for genetic counseling. Sessions may include discussions of reproductive implications and other issues related to sex education. Patients with ID regularly meet barriers when trying to obtain sex education due to the misperceptions of others as being either asexual or that such education would promote inappropriate sexual behavior. In this pilot study, we surveyed genetic counselors to explore their experiences with being asked to provide sex education counseling and their comfort in doing so for patients with ID ages 9-17. Results were analyzed from 38 respondents. Caregivers and patients most frequently requested information on puberty, sex abuse prevention, and reproductive health. Genetic counselors were most comfortable when they could provide sex education counseling within the context of a particular condition or constellation of features. They were least comfortable when they lacked familiarity with the patient, caregiver, or the family's culture. The most frequently cited barriers that prevented genetic counselors from providing sex education counseling were lack of time, lack of training, the patient's ID being too profound, and a belief that genetic counselors should not be responsible for providing sex education counseling. While many respondents reported that providing sex education counseling is not considered within the scope of a genetic counselor's practice, they also noted that patients' families initiate discussions for which counselors should be prepared. Respondents indicated that resource guides specifically designed for use by genetic counselors would be beneficial to their practice. Genetic counselors have the opportunity to embrace the role of advocate and broach the issue of sexual health with caregivers and patients by directing them toward educational resources, if not providing sex education directly to effectively serve the needs of patients and caregivers.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the\"winds of fate\" control one's destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and \"behavior\"—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,\"psychological factors,\" including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are \"cited in selected sources\" in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the\"social ecology\" of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if\"teachers paid more attention to students\" and if \"we were not treated like inmates.\"Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The \"best\" schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by\"ability\" has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as \"below average\" can have a tremendously negative effect on students' self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are \"scared straight\" or\"moralized to\" almost always fail. The question should be: \"How do schools fail adolescents?\" rather than \"How do adolescents fail school?\"Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can \"functional disorders\" such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on \"street value.\"Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and \"coaching\"surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent's problems being viewed as \"characterologic disorders\" rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual's achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as \"slow learners.\" They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including \"high-functioning autism,\"Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one's temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one's own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more \"medical model\"diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent's behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the \"patient\" where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD\"triad\") can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent's consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good \"learning hygiene\"; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and “behavior”—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,“psychological factors,” including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are “cited in selected sources” in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the“social ecology” of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if“teachers paid more attention to students” and if “we were not treated like inmates.”Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The “best” schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by“ability” has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as “below average” can have a tremendously negative effect on students’ self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are “scared straight” or“moralized to” almost always fail. The question should be: “How do schools fail adolescents?” rather than “How do adolescents fail school?”Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can “functional disorders” such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on “street value.”Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and “coaching”surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent’s problems being viewed as “characterologic disorders” rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual’s achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as “slow learners.” They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including “high-functioning autism,”Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one’s temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one’s own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more “medical model”diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent’s behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the “patient” where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD“triad”) can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent’s consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good “learning hygiene”; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

      "title": "The “no” of the Adopted Adolescent: A Combination of Factors that Encourage the Development of Oppositional Behaviours",
      "abstract": "Opposition is a common form of behaviour in adolescence, a sign of the process of self-affirmation and the quest for independence. The narcissistic foundations formed during early childhood are particularly tested at this age. They constitute a narcissistic filter protecting against invasion by the object or its deficiencies. When they are weak or deficient, opposition may take a pathological and restrictive turn, penalizing family and social inscription. This frequently occurs with adopted adolescents. The authors emphasize the reasons why the situation of adoption is liable to undermine both primary and secondary narcissistic foundations. Opposition has the effect of making imperious demands on the object while at the same time keeping it at a distance, and has more to do with taking pleasure in mastering or controlling the object than in sharing with the object. The analysis of two clinical case histories of adopted adolescents will help to highlight certain aspects of this problem. One case concerns a narcissistic confrontation owing to the mother’s alcoholism and depression in the absence of paternal regulation; the other concerns a refusal to attend school and the development of a negative identity in response to a traumatic family situation undermining the status of the adolescent’s identity. In both these situations, the “work of the negative” in Green’s sense is highlighted.",

In addition, the chapter introduces two other theoretical themes: sexual expression as a dyadic, rather than simply individual phenomenon, and the role of social networks in shaping sexual patterns. The result of the analyses suggest that adult sexual careers resemble a tree-like “global” structure, with key “local” structuring factors—physical health and sexual dysfunctions, partner availability and a partner's health, attitudes and beliefs regarding sex, and social embeddedness—entraining individuals along specific pathways. Apart from biological age, coming of age in more permissive times has a strong and enduring impact on one's sexuality, arguably due to the internalization of specific sexual templates or scripts.",

      "abstract": "THE kind of prejudice which will concern us here is limited to the irrational, negative, or hostile attitude, more or less intensely held and/or expressed by one individual or group toward members of another group, and elicited primarily by the fact of their group membership. The understanding of prejudice has in recent years become one of the major concerns of social science. Numerous studies undertaken during the past decade have considerably increased comprehension of the phenomenon. The earlier notion that the cause of prejudice was to be sought in the nature of its object has all but disappeared. It is sometimes still encountered, but chiefly as a conciliatory gesture to stimulus-response theory (if a response exists, some stimulus must have called it forth) or, almost apologetically stated, as a variant of Merton's (33) self-fulfilling prophecy (minority groups develop certain characteristics as defenses against prejudice or because of limitations imposed upon them). Early studies of prejudice were mostly statistical or descriptive-how many people in a given group showed prejudices, in what areas, against which groups. More recent research has dealt largely with personality correlates of prejudice, its development in children, and to a lesser extent with social, cultural, and situational factors which lead to its growth or favor its expression. As one consequence of these investigations, prejudice has come to be recognized as a symptom in a total personality configuration or syndrome, appearing under given social and historical conditions, as the review by Van Til and Denemark (50) indicated.",

In fact, pornography is so commonplace that soon we will be unable to imagine a time when there were multiple obstacles to acquisition. Arousal patterns may be further intensified by the voyeuristic presentation of violent pornography, increasing susceptibility to escalation. The viewer may experience their libido diminishing as pornography takes the 'sex' out of sex. When a patient is at the stage of experiencing difficulties only with partnered sex there may be reluctance to admit that their 'satisfactory pornography driven sexual experience' may even be a factor. Sexual dysfunction recovery times seem to relate to pre-porn exposure to masturbation and sexual experience. If there has been a sexual template set prior to their compulsive pornography use then it can be re-awakened, as it will still exist within their limbic system memory.",

      "abstract": "In an era in which gender meanings and relations are being examined, destabilized, and renegotiated on every social and personal front, feminists must analyze any text on health, sexuality, bodies, children, domestic life, work life, emotion, laws, power—on any domain or metaphor of social life—as being at least in part about gender, and therefore as a location to be scrutinized. John Gagnon has argued for the past twenty years that gender training and experiences during development result in fundamental gender differences in adult sexual scripts and responses. Men's experiences in adolescence with genital arousal and orgasm, in conjunction with homosocial competitiveness and identification, create expectations and conditioning that bias men toward a goal-oriented, genital, self-focused sexual style. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) sexual dysfunction classification is laid out in a scrupulously gender-equal way.",

      "abstract": "The authors present new measures important to distinguish their method from others of teenage premarital sexual behavior using numerical ratings of sexual expression (encouragement of sexual behavior) sexual restraint (taboos or restrictions on sexual behavior) and differentiation from childhood (whether childhood and adolescence are considered the same or different) for the 186 societies in the Standard Sample of the Ethnographic Atlas. Measures of sexual nonrestraint and sexual expression are compared for boys and girls in childhood and adolescence. A measure of sexual freedom was created by summing sexual expression and sexual nonrestraint. The authors predict and show that measures of sexual behavior in childhood and adolescence will have a stronger correlation in societies where differentiation from childhood is low. Most societies impose more restraint in later childhood than in earlier childhood and in adolescence rather than in childhood matching restraint with physiological maturation of children. Most societies show no sex differences in sexual freedom but those which do generally show more freedom for boys than girls. Societies tend to have greater differentiation from childhood to adolescence for boys than for girls. In other studies not limited to adolescence sexual freedom in adolescence was highly correlated with measures of premarital sexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake and Kingsley, 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviant is a formal violation of the rules. Although the wording of reactivists and normative definitions appear similar, each conceptualization focuses attention on very different aspects of deviance: the normative definitions focus on the person who engages in norm‐violating behavior while reactivist definitions focus on the social audiences that define deviants.",

The present study was carried out to evaluate the existence of a nycthemeral rhythm of human sexual behavior and to identify environmental factors responsible for the rhythmic pattern.Methods: Non-traditional university students (ages 18 to 51 years) recorded the times of day when they went to sleep, when they woke up, and when they had sex for 3 consecutive weeks. They also answered a questionnaire designed to identify the causes of their selection of time for sex.Results: The majority of sexual encounters took place at bedtime (11 pm to 1 am). The most common explanations for this temporal pattern were the rigidity of the professional work schedule and family obligations and the availability of the partner, which reduced the opportunity for sexual encounters at other times of the day.Conclusion: Most sexual encounters take place around bedtime. Although the presence of an endogenous component responsible for this temporal pattern cannot be excluded, the evidence indicates strong environmental forcing, particularly from the work/family schedule of the individuals and from partner availability.",

      "abstract": "Very little research has examined what goes on in the minds of young men during sex. Such an exploration might reveal gender-normative discourses as well as challenges to such. This discourse analysis understands internal speech as that which both instantiates status quo ideals of masculinity and which challenges them. We use theories of hegemonic masculinity and Vygotskyan notions of “others in the head” to understand how hegemonic masculinity is reproduced during the act of having sex. This study is based on qualitative interviews with thirteen heterosexual young adult US men asking what goes through their mind during sex. Young heterosexual men produce a masculinity discourse that supports dominant constructions of heterosexuality, monitoring their sexual behaviors based on imagined and expected reactions of abstract and very real male reference groups. The analysis shows men describing thoughts during sex that make sex like work, keeps in mind a variety of other people, some literally awaiting news of the sex, and some abstract representations of masculinity. Men report a constant self-evaluation based on women’s performances of pleasure, for example, screaming, never construed as inauthentic, or as a performance at all. Thoughts about masculinity were not present in intimate moments when men described a “letting go of masculinity” in order to be intimate.",

A sample of 52,588 adults were asked what percentage of the time they reached orgasm when they were sexually intimate during the past month, heterosexual men reported orgasming 95% of the time in contrast to only 65% of heterosexual women [2]. This is termed the orgasm gap. One cause of the orgasm gap is that although the typical woman needs about 15 minutes of stimulation to achieve orgasm during penile-vaginal-intercourse [3, 4], a typical man needs less than 6 minutes [5]. This fact suggests that men often reach orgasm before his female partner has, leading to the orgasm gap.",

Se ha encontrado que este periodo tiene un impacto en la sexualidad de las mujeres y, en consecuencia, en la de los varones. El objetivo del presente escrito fue reportar las dificultades sexuales que los hombres experimentan durante el embarazo de sus parejas. Participaron 6 adultos que eran padres de uno o dos hijos. Los padres fueron entrevistados de manera individual. Se encontro que las dificultades sexuales de los padres mas destacadas fueron: desconocimiento sobre fechas y condiciones de la fecundacion, creencias acerca del impacto negativo del coito en el cuerpo embarazado y el feto, prejuicios morales contra el sexo en este periodo, impericia sexual, necesidades sexuales insatisfechas, disminucion del deseo y energia sexual debido a fatiga y preocupaciones, y contraposicion entre sus necesidades y deseos sexuales y los de la conyuge. Se concluyo que estas dificultades dependieron de las condiciones fisicas y psicologicas de la companera embarazada, siendo mediadas por las concepciones masculinas acerca del sexo, embarazo, parto y proyecto de vida. Se sugirio que existe la necesidad de que los varones reciban asesoria y entrenamiento por profesionales de la salud durante el periodo prenatal para que practiquen comportamientos mas reconfortantes, saludables y solidarios durante el embarazo.",

      "title": "Depression and Psychological Distress",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a common and often-recurrent disorder that impairs functioning and reduces quality of life; it is currently ranked as the largest contributor to disease-related disability worldwide. It is of particular importance for women’s health because, from early adolescence onwards, women are roughly twice as likely as men to experience depression. Depression is a multifactorial disorder, with evidence of influences from genetic and other predisposing individual characteristics, exposure to adverse perinatal and childhood experiences, and more immediately precipitating stressors. As a result, a number of different developmental pathways may be involved, mediated via impacts on aspects of neurobiological, psychological, and social development. This chapter provides an overview of recent evidence on these themes. It begins by sketching epidemiological findings on changing rates and gender ratios in depressive disorders from childhood to older age. It then examines the main domains of risk for depressive conditions, exploring recent evidence on the extent to which men and women differ in exposure or susceptibility to risks that affect both sexes, and whether some gender-specific risks may be involved. Throughout, it highlights the differing pathways through which individual vulnerabilities, childhood adversities, and later stressors have been argued to combine to contribute to the genesis of depression.",

      "abstract": "A top urologist’s prescription for better sexual health and overall wellness. According to research studies, men with health problems, and more specifically sexual health problems, are more likely than women to have had no recent contact with a doctor regardless of income or ethnicity. This reluctance to seek medical help means that for men, their diseases often go undetected until it is significantly progressed, and this late discovery has serious consequences. To make matters worse, when men do see their physicians, many doctors find it difficult to talk about sexual health with their patients. Common conditions such as erectile dysfunction or Peyronie’s disease (an acquired penile curvature) are often dismissed or simply go unaddressed. This avoidance creates real health problems: erectile dysfunction (ED)alone affects as much as 20% of men worldwide, occurring in as much as 52% of men between the ages 40 and 70. Serious skin cancers, penile injuries, and infections can go untreated for years. And, doctors lose a valuable tool in predicting other chronic health issues when sexual health isn’t discussed. Dr. Burnett takes a deep dive here into identifying what healthy sexual function actually looks like, and clearly identifies the distinct components of the male sexual response that every healthy man experiences. For each of these components, readers will learn about the specific problems that can present, their underlying or contributing causes, and how each can be resolved. It will explode the myth that the only way to enhance men’s sexual health is through testosterone therapies. Instead, his effective prescription for enhanced sexual function and overall health highlights the best that evidence-based medicine has to offer: a comprehensive mixture of easy yet important lifestyle changes, the most advanced medications including hormone therapies when they are appropriately administered, mental health therapies, external aids, and surgery. In total, readers will have a cutting-edge life strategy for achieving optimal sexual health now and for years to come.",

El objetivo de este trabajo es acercarnos a la vivencia de la sexualidad en hombres mayores a través de uno de los principales cuestionarios empleados en el estudio de la respuesta sexual masculina: el Índice Internacional de la Función Eréctil. Para ello, 38 hombres de entre 53 y 81 años completaron este y otros instrumentos a través de los cuales se encontró que si bien algunos aspectos de la respuesta sexual (como la función eréctil o el deseo sexual) efectivamente se veían afectados negativamente en hombres mayores, el impacto sobre otros tanto o más importantes como la satisfacción sexual global es limitado. Estas evidencias aportan un nuevo punto de vista a la comprensión de la vivencia de la sexualidad en la edad adulta y permite mejorar las estrategias preventivas y de intervención en este colectivo.",

Various regularities are established: the lubrication is connected with difficulties in women with inflammatory changes in the internal sexual organs. The feeling of sexual excitation during sexual intercourse is stronger in women with larger number of sexual partners since the beginning of their sexual life. Disturbances in the occurrence of orgasm are more frequent in employees. Dyspareunia is connected mainly with organic changes in genitals, but it is determining factor for the success of sexual life. The frequency of the experienced pleasure is influenced by various social and biological factors comparatively slightly.",

      "abstract": "A surprising number of men report a lack of sexual desire, with conservative estimates ranging between 15 and 25% of adult males. Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one's partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one's sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

      "abstract": "Parents are the first source of a child's learning of her or his gender. In fact, sex-role stereotyping of infants by parents may occur within the first 24 hours of birth. This study examined the nature of parental stereotyping on the basis of their infant's sex by obtaining parents' descriptions of their newborn and toy and clothing preferences for their newborn. In 1974, Rubin found that parents responded stereotypically to their infants on the basis of sex. Following Rubin's interview approach, 50 parent pairs from two urban hospitals were asked to participate in a parent-infant study and were subsequently interviewed 24 hours postpartum. Parents were asked open-ended descriptive questions about their newborn, given a semantic differential scale of 18 bi-polar objectives, asked about the importance of others recognizing their baby's sex, and asked a set of questions relating to the preference of clothing and toy choices for their newborn. Findings suggest that parents do stereotype their infants on the basis of biological sex. Sons were more likely to be described as strong, perfect, big or big-featured and energetic,--while daughters received more descriptions that mentioned their eyes, skin, or facial features and were also more likely to be described as small, tiny, or weak. Parents of boys were also more likely to state a preference for gender-specific toys and clothing. Infant sex did not make a notable difference on the importance that parents attributed to others recognizing their baby's sex. Fathers were more likely to perceive and describe their daughters more stereotypically than were mothers of either daughters or sons. Further studies to investigate gender stereotyping and its consequences as well as the interplay between the macro and micro levels of gender relations in society are suggested.",

The contexts in which the medical and lifestyle factors associated with involuntary childlessness occur, and overcoming these barriers, are explored from within the wider sociocultural, family, and work environments. The evidence presented shows that, with increasing use of technology and innovation to assist individuals to achieve the goal of parenthood, accurate record keeping, monitoring, and human rights need to be at the forefront of these interventions, and allow the resultant children their basic human right to accurate birth and genetic information. The experience of involuntary childlessness and treatment success and/or failures therefore straddle psychological, behavioral, sociocultural, physical, and medical domains, which should be weighted proportionally in research, policy, and practice.",

While sexual abuse is a physical and psychological health issue for an individual, with multiple and varied repercussions, it also involves aspects of the earliest bonds, the bonds of attachment, since it usually takes place within the family circle. In light of three clinical case studies, the article discusses the concept of destructiveness both generally and specifically in situations of sexual abuse, in order to propose some key points concerning the child’s speech during treatment. It should be pointed out that the child, whether or not he or she confides in the clinician, is often psycho-traumatized. Destructiveness relates to the destructive nature of a living or non-living element and, more generally, to the ability to destroy. In connection with this notion, we can generally observe so-called gravity factors and other so-called protective factors, which are likely to coexist. If the former are more substantial, there is a high probability that the symptoms will be debilitating and long-lasting, and we note that they may worsen over time or appear in a delayed manner. If the protective factors are substantial, then the child is more likely to experience mild trauma and more or less rapid healing.",

Successful navigation of the social environment requires individuals to adapt to continually changing stimuli. Stress impacts health by impairing an individual's ability to adapt. Impairments in the ability to adapt may result in significant challenges to mental and physical well‐being in the form of psychological distress and/or the development of chronic disease. Men and women are often exposed to different types of stressors and different levels of stress, and tend to respond differently to stress. This results in varying health outcomes. Inquiries into the relationship between gender, stress, and health have increased understanding of the processes by which adaptability is compromised. Gender is one of the major ways in which individuals organize their lives, and most people fail to realize its strong influence on social life.",

Based on findings from primate behaviors, I hypothesize that those protohominids who were rapid ejaculators (perhaps with a highly sensitive glans) were less likely to be repelled by the females and/or attacked by other sexually aroused males. As a result, they had more opportunities to copulate and to impregnate. Thus, the likelihood that speedy ejaculation would be represented in the succeeding generations was progressively increased. Hence, male Homo sapiens today are over‐represented with individuals possessing this once superior trait. I further argue that premature ejaculation has become dysfunctional only in recent times as a consequence of the lag between biological and social changes.",

      "abstract": "This qualitative study investigated the experiences of twelve adults who discovered new information about the identity of one or both parents in adolescence or later. Some had grown up in adoptive or step-families; others had been conceived using donated sperm. Participants were interviewed once about their experiences when the information was revealed, and the effect they perceived it had over time. The transcribed interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, Jarman & Osborn, 1999).\r\n\r\nThe findings indicated that for many participants the impact of unplanned revelations was considerable, and the emotional repercussions often persisted for many years. The information affected participant's perceptions of their sense of self, and who they were in relation to others. The effects of this appeared to reverberate through many parts of the family system. It was suggested that concealment may have affected early parent-child relationships and contributed to feelings of difference or not belonging. The secret was perceived to have affected family communication before the revelation, and this was often difficult afterwards.\r\n\r\nFindings were considered in relation to identity development, attachment theory and social constructionist perspectives. A tentative model of the processes by which people integrate this information was proposed. Suggestions were made regarding therapeutic work with individuals and families after revelations of this nature, and those considering the opening of such secrets. Further research in this area is indicated and is particularly relevant to families created through gamete donation.",

      "title": "Insomnia Disorder: Gender Issues Over the Lifespan",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is the most common sleep disorder in the general population, with higher prevalence in women. Three specific periods in a woman's life-puberty, pregnancy and menopause-seem to be associated with marked gender differences in insomnia prevalence. Puberty is a critical stage for the development of insomnia, with an increase in its prevalence among girls after menarche. During pregnancy and the postpartum period, women also report a rise in insomnia symptoms. Various factors, including hormonal, physiological, relational, emotional and environmental ones, can affect sleep during these sensitive times. Furthermore, the transition to menopause tends to exacerbate gender differences in insomnia prevalence, as it is associated with the emergence of physiological and psychological symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, sleep disturbances and mood changes) that can impair sleep. Thus, biological and psychosocial factors seem to explain gender differences in insomnia prevalence and characteristics throughout the lifespan. Considering this framework, this review aims at summarising and deepening the existing empirical literature on gender differences in sleep physiology, insomnia prevalence and clinical characteristics, and predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors for insomnia disorder, in different ages throughout the lifespan. Attention is also given to sexual minority groups, providing a snapshot of sleep difficulties and insomnia symptoms among transgender people. Although the topic is relevant, available literature is still quite scarce. The investigation of gender differences in insomnia disorder could be useful to better understand its prognosis and outline an appropriate and personalised treatment.",

Another myth is that sexual development is beginning earlier these days than it did even 20 years ago. The evidence for this is weak or non-existent. A third myth is those in their teens have extraordinarily high levels of sex hormones, and that these gradually decline in the twenties. Finally, there is a widespread and mistaken notion that all those in their teens are, or at least would like to be, highly promiscuous in their sexual behaviour.",

Aging is mostly neglected in DSM-IV as an associated feature of sexual dysfunction and its subjective aspects, which become more salient as age progresses. However, a significant improvement in the DSM-IV edition should be recognized. The diagnostic criteria for sexual dysfunction now require that the disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulties (Table 8.1). Consequently, age-related declines in a man's sexual function may not be categorized as dysfunctional unless they are problematic for the individual or his partner.",

Both men had been subjected to firm, harsh behavior modification by their parents, particularly their mothers, during childhood in response to effeminate behavior. While both men continue to manifest major gender/sexual issues as adults, their outcomes have been dramatically different. The first man takes female hormones and denies any satisfaction from his sexuality. This individual remains convinced that he has female internal sexual organs and monthly internal menstrual bleeding. Although he has a career, he has become alienated from his family and is a social cripple. The second man has a successful career, lives a heterosexual life with his children and wife of 20 years and is involved in his community. He is visually attracted to men and remains obsessed with male pornography. This individual credits his mother with directing him toward a successful heterosexual life, which he feels has prevented the emotional burden of an active homosexual life. These two cases illustrate the tremendous influence played by environment and parental input on the sexual perspectives of developing children.",

These sex differences, sometimes, reflect the different hormonal environment of the adults, but they often remain present after subjects of both sexes are placed in the same endocrine conditions following gonadectomy associated or not with hormonal replacement therapy. They are then the result of combined influences of organizational actions of sex steroids acting early during development, or genetic differences between the sexes, or epigenetic mechanisms differentially affecting males and females. Sexual partner preference is a sexually differentiated behavioural trait that is clearly controlled in animals by the same type of mechanisms. This is also probably true in humans, even if critical experiments that would be needed to obtain scientific proof of this assertion are often impossible for pragmatic or ethical reasons. Clinical, epidemiological and correlative studies provide, however, converging evidence strongly suggesting, if not demonstrating, that endocrine, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms acting during the pre- or perinatal life control human sexual orientation, i.e. homosexuality versus heterosexuality. Whether they interact with postnatal psychosexual influences remains, however, unclear at present.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background/introduction</h3> While sexual activity, including partner change, is known to continue throughout the life course, there is a paucity of qualitative evidence on how adults over 45 years engage with risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), limiting the scope for effective health promotion among this age group. <h3>Aims/objectives</h3> The research aimed to explore older adults’ sexual risk-taking behaviour within the context of sexuality in later life. <h3>Methods</h3> A qualitative in-depth study involving 31 interviews with middle aged heterosexual men and women aged 45 to 65, recruited from sexual health clinic and community settings. <h3>Results</h3> Vulnerability to STI risk emerged around key life course transitions, including following divorce, separation and bereavement. Some spoke enthusiastically of embracing sexual freedom and pleasure within a perceived changed culture, resulting in frequent partner change; however, many found themselves ‘re-engaging’ with their sexual careers within an unfamiliar gendered landscape. Lacking an (ageing) body confidence led to the prioritisation of intimacy over STI risk; condoms were viewed as being for birth control and therefore mostly unnecessary, or linked with casual sex and lack of trust. STIs were commonly considered to be a young person’s concern. <h3>Discussion/conclusions</h3> Information provision alone will not be enough to counter the complexities of navigating the dramatically different sexual landscape these older adults find themselves within compared to their youth, particularly those who have emerged from long-term relationships. A separately focussed approach to STI prevention taking account of life course experience, ageing and cultural change is advocated.",

      "abstract": "Aggression by cats towards humans is a serious behavioural, welfare and public health problem, although owners may believe it is an inevitable part of cat ownership. There has been little scientific investigation of the risk factors associated with this problem. One hundred and seven owners in the Sao Paulo region of Brazil, took part in a survey aimed at investigating the perceived prevalence of the problem, defining the most common contexts of human directed aggression and identifying associated potential risk factors. Human directed aggression occurred in 49.5% of cats and was most commonly associated with situations involving petting and play, followed by protection of a resource, when startled, when observing an unfamiliar animal and least commonly when unfamiliar people were present. Pedigree status, neuter status, a history of early trauma, sensitivity to being stroked, the absence of other cats in the home, relationship with other animals, level of background activity at home, access to the outside and tendency to be alone (meaning tendency to staying far from the family members) were all associated with an increased risk in one or more context. However, sex, age, age when acquired, source of pet, attachment to a specific household member, type of domestic accommodation, relationship with another cat if present and contact with other animals did not appear to increase the risk. The results suggest sensitivity to being stroked and background levels of stress in the home are the most pervasive risk factors, and future research should aim to investigate these factors further. These data are of relevance when advising owners about the risk and development of this problem.",

      "abstract": "We examined young adults' essentialist reasoning about gender categories. Previous developmental results suggest that until age 9 or 10, children show marked essentialist reasoning about gender, but this disappears by early adulthood. In contrast, results from social cognition suggest that essentialist thinking about social categories persists into adulthood. To address this discrepancy, 69 undergraduates engaged in a switched-at-birth task under speeded or delayed conditions. Delayed participants made essentialist decisions about physical but not behavioral properties and replicated past findings. Speeded participants showed markedly higher essentialist responding for behavioral properties compared with delayed participants. These findings suggest that gender essentialism does not necessarily diminish in adulthood but instead may be suppressed by more explicit reasoning processes.",

      "abstract": "While it is well known that people with an intellectual disability experience the same needs for intimacy as those without an intellectual disability, a number of developmental, structural, environmental, and attitudinal barriers circumvent the expression of sexuality in people with an intellectual disability – particularly in institutional and residential health care settings. People with an intellectual disability generally have lower levels of sexual knowledge than those without an intellectual disability, and sexual exploration and expression is frequently viewed with concern by mental health care practitioners and caregivers, who may regard people with an intellectual disability as being ‘nonsexual’ or ‘hypersexual’. However, the rights of people with an intellectual disability to sexual expression have been established in policy and legislation. Service providers are required at times to make determinations regarding the ability of people with an intellectual disability to consent to sexual intercourse in a number of health care settings. There is a dearth of published literature on psychometric instruments to assess sexual knowledge and consent capacity. This article briefly reviews the more commonly used sexual knowledge and consent assessments for people with mild to moderate intellectual disability and advances recommendations in this regard.",

Under the impact of the pre-oedipal castration; many girls developed a special type of attachment to dolls or other inanimate objects, different from the earlier type of doll play in that the dolls and other objects may serve as infantile fetishes in support of the sense of femaleness. Core gender identity pertains to the kind of man or woman the individual is, particularly in the sexual area. R. A. Spitz and M. Wolf reported that infants of mothers confined to institutions developed autoerotic behaviour during their first year only if they had been able to establish a tie to the mother of good enough quality, a finding corroborated by S. Provence and R. Lipton. Particularly in the boys, the new excitement and exhibitionistic pride in urination was coupled with clearly discernible scoptophilic development.",

Parents confirmed the memory events and dated the memories. There were surprisingly few developmental differences between the earliest memories of children. Although 6--9-year-olds recalled earlier events than did older children, there were no differences between older age groups. Memories from all age groups were similar in structure, social orientation, and the nature of the recalled event. However, memories of older children were more likely to involve negative affect. There were also few gender differences, although girls were more likely to recall traumatic or transitional events while boys were more likely to recall play events. Overall, results deepen the paradox of early memory: 6--9-year-olds have verbally accessible memories from very early childhood that then seem to disappear as they get older.",

      "abstract": "Child abuse is defined as adult physically injuring a child not by accident, but in anger or deliberately . . . in the process of caring for the child. Many abused children are physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or emotionally disturbed either before the abuse or as a result of it. Child abuse is often considered synonymous with child battering or the battered child syndrome. Although it may not seem important to differentiate between the two, they do differ and we should treat them accordingly. The battered child syndrome represents an extreme form of child abuse. Characteristics of perpetrators of this subgroup differ from the larger group. The prevention, treatment, and general prognosis of the victim and the perpetrator also vary greatly from those of simple child abuse. The battered child syndrome is a cross-cultural phenomenon. Abuse in this case is predetermined and can be likened to torture. In many instances, the perpetrator is psychopathic. The beatings are almost always recurrent; the prognosis, poor. Hefler and Kempe suggest that a battered child returned to this environment has a fifty-fifty chance of surviving more than one year.2 Many students of this form of abuse suggest that the child not be returned to his previous environment. Child abuse as a whole, however, presents a different set of characteristics. Even though the battered child syndrome is generally demographically included, several ecological patterns emerge which lend hope to the survival and even much improved environment of the victim.",

      "abstract": "El nacimiento de un niño/a con algún tipo de desorden del desarrollo sexual plantea situaciones que involucran tanto los aspectos biológicos como los sociales. En este sentido, es indiscutible que un recién nacido/a con «ambigüedad genital» confronta las concepciones más usuales acerca de sexo, género y papeles sexuales, por cuanto se espera que un cuerpo sexuado se comporte, en los ámbitos públicos y privados, acorde con las expectativas sobre la orientación hacia a un ser masculino o femenino. Sin embargo, el ser intersexual rompe con este paradigma, ocasionando –como todo lo relativo al sexo y género– múltiples representaciones, prejuicios, discriminaciones y significados que afectan severamente la vida y los derechos de estas personas.En los últimos 20 años se han modificado las prácticas médicas de «normalización» del cuerpo, verdaderas «intervenciones» quirúrgicas que hoy se realizan bajo criterios muy seleccionados, respetando el sentir y los derechos de los niños con desórdenes del desarrollo sexual y posponiendo muchos de los actos quirúrgicos de «corrección genital» que se hacían en la infancia.El objetivo de este trabajo es recabar las narrativas y experiencias de los médicos especialistas que atienden a niños con desórdenes del desarrollo sexual en el Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, en Bogotá.The birth of a child with some kind of sexual development disorder creates situations involving both biological and social aspects. In this regard, it is indisputable that a newborn with 'genital ambiguity' confronts the most common conceptions about sex, gender and sexual roles, because it is expected that a sexed body behaves in public and private environments, in line with expectations of being a male or female. However, the intersexual person breaks this paradigm, producing, like everything related to sex and gender- multiple representations, prejudice, discrimination, and meanings that severely affect the lives and rights of these people.In the last 20 years, medical practices have changed the 'normalization' of the body, with surgery now being performed under highly selected criteria, respecting the feelings and rights of children with sexual development disorder, and postponing many of the surgical acts of \"genital correction\" that were made in childhood.The aim of this work is to collect narratives and experiences of medical specialists who treat children with sexual development disorder in San Ignacio University Hospital in Bogotá.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Die Zahlen von Menschen, die ihre sexuelle Identität nicht als heterosexuell sondern als schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell oder in einer anderen Kategorie definieren, steigen seit Jahren leicht an; man schätzt, dass in westlichen Ländern ca. 5% der Bevölkerung zu den sexuellen Minderheiten zu rechnen sind. Diese Studie ist darauf angelegt, die psychischen Problemlagen der sexuellen Minoritäten anhand US-amerikanischer Bevölkerungsstudien sowie weiterer wichtiger Studien aus anderen Ländern genauer darzustellen. Ergebnisse Zusammenfassend ergibt sich Folgendes: Unabhängig vom Geschlecht liegt der Konsum von Alkohol und anderen Drogen sowie die Abhängigkeit von diesen Stoffen mindestens auf dem Niveau der heterosexuellen Männer. Lesbisch/schwule und bisexuelle Frauen sind noch etwas stärker durch den Konsum von psychoaktiven Substanzen belastet als schwule und bisexuelle Männer. Untersucht man Belastungen durch Depressionen und Suizidversuche, findet man wiederum bei den sexuellen Minoritäten höhere Belastungen. LSB-Frauen haben die höchsten Raten hinsichtlich Depressionen und Ängsten. Darüber hinaus weisen die Daten darauf hin, dass bisexuelle Männer und Frauen hohe psychische Belastungen haben. Alles in allem genommen ist davon auszugehen, dass die sexuellen Minoritäten einen relativ hohen Bedarf an Behandlungen ihrer psychischen Störungen haben. Dennoch gibt es bislang nur sehr wenige Behandlungsprogramme mit der Zielgruppe: sexuelle Minoritäten. Schlussfolgerungen Wir benötigen dringend deutsche Studien zu sexuellen Minoritäten allgemein und besonders zu trans* Personen mit ihren sehr spezifischen Problemlagen. Die Studien sollten neben den Substanzkonsumstörungen der sexuellen Minoritäten auch andere psychische Störungen erfassen. Kenntnisse über die psychische Befindlichkeit sexueller Minoritäten sind die Grundlage für optimale Behandlungsgestaltungen.",

      "abstract": "Male suicide continues to be a significant issue worldwide for which there are a myriad of social risk factors. Amongst these, distressed and/or disrupted (i.e., separation, divorce) intimate partner relationships are known to heighten men's mental illness and suicide risk. The current qualitative study offers novel insights to the connections between masculinity and mental illness in and after men's intimate partner relationships. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 47 Canadian and Australian men, three themes were inductively derived: 1) The trouble inside, 2) Breaking up and breaking down, and 3) Finding help. The 'trouble inside' results revealed relationship transitions wherein challenges to couple dynamics flowed from diverse life course events (conflict, illness, bereavement, co-parenting). Partnership transgressions (most often infidelity) also featured to heighten men's mental illness vulnerabilities and threaten the feasibility of the relationship. 'Breaking up and breaking down' chronicled participants' anxiety, depression and suicidality in the aftermath of their relationship ending. Herein, substance use and other maladaptive behaviours were used by men to blunt feelings and/or self-medicate mental illness. These strategies were ineffectual for moving on from blaming partners or grieving the loss of support and social connectedness provided by ex-partners. 'Finding help' included men's eventual self-help, uptake of informal assistance from friends and family, formal professional care services, and the use of facilitated male peer group resources. Norming the use of these diverse help resources were men's alignments to strength-based asset-building masculine ideals, wherein their help-seeking was bridged to, and reflective of their (albeit latent) commitment to better managing their mental health and future relationships. Highlighting the gendered dimensions of mental illness in men's intimate partner relationships, the current study also thoughtfully considers content and contexts for the delivery of tailored upstream suicide prevention programs focussed on men building better relationships.",

Interpersonal factors are also associated with sexual desire; both passionate love and overall relationship health (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, adjustment) are strongly linked with the amount of sexual desire that individuals feel for their partners. Reductions in sexual desire are common in most romantic relationships; however, sudden or sharp decreases may signal the development of an underlying interpersonal issue. Although less examined than other variables, sociocultural factors, including norms, stereotypes, laws, and religious doctrine, may also inhibit or facilitate the experience and expression of sexual desire.",

      "title": "The Unheard Gender: The Neglect of Men as Social Work Clients",
      "abstract": "This critical review shows that, despite increasing attention to fathers in social work practice and research, men are still largely the 'unheard gender'. Almost all the social work literature that deals with men discusses them as fathers, namely in terms of their function in the family. Very little of it looks at men in other roles or situations or concerns itself with men's experiences, feelings or needs. Similar neglect of men characterises social work practice and training. The review points to a vicious circle in which the neglect of men in research, practice and training reinforce one another. It offers explanations for the neglect and suggestions for how to better include men as social work clients.",

      "title": "Assessing Sexually Abused Children",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is an event in which an adult is involved and the child is left confused, frightened and ashamed (Kempe, C.H. & Kempe, R., 1984). The child may have been hurt, or be excited, or both. If abuse has occurred over a prolonged period, the child may be flat, withdrawn and apathetic or angry, defiant and difficult. Some children and young people may also express their distress through self harm, or become anorexic, or run away to live on the streets. The emotional impact is what needs to be understood, what has happened in the individual's mind, if we are to intervene most effectively. Sexual abuse is of a different order from other forms of abuse, because of the linking up of sexuality and aggression. Such violence results in a very primitive destruction of the child's mind. Irving Kaufman (1989) used the evocative term 'soul murder' to describe emotional abuse. In sexual abuse, there is nearly always an element of physical abuse, but there is also serious emotional abuse. At one and the same time, the child's mind and body are being 'raped'. The child's body may recover fairly quickly once the abuse has ceased, but the mind is left profoundly traumatized. While we do not yet fully understand all that happens to the developing mind, the more we struggle to do so, the more damaging sexual abuse is revealed to be (Renvoize, J., 1983; Morris, M., 1982; Baker Miller, 1976).",

The immediate reaction is to be harshly judgmental toward the perpetrator; that harshness may be the defense by which we disown the possibility of such propensities in ourselves. However, the mandate of the physician is to heal and not to judge. Fulfillment of that mandate requires understanding and control of powerful feelings. . . .",

Many of the abused children in India encounters are traumatised and some refuse to speak for months. To aggravate matters, children often feel guilty and blame themselves for their mistreatment.

      "title": "Factores psicológicos y socioculturales en la vida sexual de los adultos mayores",
      "abstract": "La sexualidad desempena un papel muy importante a lo largo de la vida, asi que no existe motivo alguno para creer que con la edad desaparecen el interes o las practicas sexuales; el placer no solo depende del aparato genital, sino tambien de toda una serie de excitaciones y actividades efectuadas desde la infancia, las cuales producen un placer que no puede reducirse a la satisfaccion de una necesidad fisiologica basica, denominada como “normal” en el amor sexual. Por lo general, la sociedad relaciona mas a la sexualidad con la juventud, alimentando muchos estereotipos negativos acerca de la sexualidad en la vejez. El objetivo del presente estudio es identificar los factores psicologicos y socioculturales que intervienen en la percepcion de las personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 anos de edad que viven en el poblado de Sabancuy perteneciente al Municipio del Carmen, Campeche. Para ello se utilizo el metodo descriptivo, no experimental con alcance cualitativo, con instrumentos: ficha de identificacion, test bienestar psicologico y la satisfaccion sexual en parejas de edad adulta media y edad adulta tardia, Inventario de Autoestima de Coopersmith, version para adultos. El analisis de datos se realizo mediante un ordenador personal (PC) con herramientas tales como: manejador de bases de datos (Word) y hoja de calculo (Excel). Los sujetos objeto de estudio fueron 50 personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 anos de edad. En los resultados se encontro que la autoestima, considerada un factor psicologico, no intervino en su percepcion de mantener una vida sexual activa, ya que la mayoria de la poblacion manifesto tener autoestima alta, aunque estos no tienen una vida sexual activa, es decir, la autoestima no influyo de manera directa en la actividad sexual de los adultos mayores investigados. Se pregunto a los adultos mayores en estudio: ?cree que es malo para la salud, especialmente en la vejez, la actividad sexual?, ante lo cual, 20 % de los hombres con rango de edad de 70 a 79 contesto en las encuestas que no es malo para la salud tener relaciones sexuales, pero que ya no lo realizan porque ya no es lo mismo; asimismo, se les pregunto si en la actualidad mantenian relaciones sexuales, y los resultados mostraron que 34 adultos mayores ya no tienen relaciones sexuales y 10 hombres si tienen relaciones sexuales aunque ya no sea con su pareja. Al preguntar a los adultos mayores si consideran necesaria la penetracion o coito para obtener satisfaccion sexual, 13 de los adultos mayores varones respondieron que consideran necesaria la penetracion para obtener satisfaccion sexual. En conclusion, la creencia de que la edad y el declinar de la actividad sexual estan inexorablemente unidos, ha provocado que no se preste atencion suficiente a una de las actividades que provee mayor calidad de vida, la sexualidad. Sin embargo, la mayoria de las personas de edad avanzada son capaces de tener relaciones y de sentir placer en toda la gama de las actividades como sucede en las personas mas jovenes.",

They also tended to delay first intercourse for a longer time than peers in other family structures, and this delay was associated with nearly all other positive outcomes regarding the sexual behavior.",

However, investigations of when and how these differences develop have been scant. We applied two forced choice infidelity scenarios in a large community sample of high school students (age 16-19, N = 1266). In line with previous findings on adults using the forced choice paradigm, adolescent males found the sexual aspect of imagined infidelity more distressing than adolescent females did. Nevertheless, there was no effect of age on the jealousy responses, and age did not moderate the sex difference. There were neither any effects of three covariates (having had first sexual intercourse, being in a committed romantic relationship, and sociosexuality), neither as markers of pubertal maturation nor as psychosocial environmental stimuli. Future research needs to investigate even younger samples in order to specify at what age the sex difference in jealousy responses emerges.",

Present study aimed to know socio demographic variables, which are responsible for criminal behavior because criminals are not born they are made, and if we as a society can make them then we as a society also have the power to cure them. AJuvenile Delinquent, a person who is under age (below 18), who is found to have committed a crime in states which have declared by law that a minor lacks responsibility and thus may not be sentenced as an adult. The sample of the present study form 50 male delinquents children from “Bal-Sampreshan Grah”, Manacamp, Raipur (C.G.) were purposively selected for the study. These juvenile delinquents sometimes have mental disorders/behavioural issues such as post traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder, and are sometimes diagnosed with conduct disorder partially as a result of their delinquent behaviours. Many factors like schools, neighbourhood, Family, Society, Situations are equally responsible for the degradation or fall of a child. Hence, instead of labelling them as one we must try and find ways, rectify the errors in their lives which led them to behave in this manner. Children can be easily rehabilitated and psychological rehabilitation can be helpful to take them back in society.",

      "abstract": "A large number of couples who end up their reproductive career with only one child presents a serious problem for demographic trends of a region in which they reside. A question rarely posed is what kind of consequences that phenomenon has for a family climate and family dynamics of those families. An even more important question is what kind of consequences the same phenomenon has for personality development of a child who grows up as a single child. What kind of characteristics and what personality traits are more likely to develop in a child that grows without his/her siblings? The results of our research show that single children get better results on the tasks that require recognition of one?s own emotional states and motives of one?s own behavior than first born and second born children. However, single children score less favorably than first or second born on the tasks that require forecasting other people?s behavior. The explanation for this may be that single children are self-centered due to the lack of interaction with siblings. Other possible explanation may be a specific parenting style that a single child receives from his/her parents. This parenting style is uniquely different from parenting style that a second or third born child receives due to the unique situation created by the fact that he/she is a single child.",

The impact of mixed messages, media, and medications are also important factors that affect the sexual function or dysfunction of the elderly. Clinicians are encouraged to have adequate knowledge on elder's sexuality and attitudes and to be aware of their own personal attitudes and beliefs while giving advice or treating the elderly. Proper training during medical school and specialization are important milestones that may facilitate the task of practitioners and help the elderly seek advice and talk more freely about possible sexual dysfunctions or worries.

      "abstract": "The sexual abuse of children is not a new phenomenon, but the traumatic short- and long-term mental health consequences make it essential to study and, ultimately, prevent. The labels for child sexual abuse (CSA) vary and have changed over time, examples being “child sexual abuse,” “child sexual assault,” “child sexual exploitation” and “unwanted sexual experiences.” Each has slightly different meanings and implications. Researchers, practitioners, criminal justice personnel, and policymakers also differ on how to define other aspects of CSA (e.g., age of the child, age differential between child and offender, what acts constitute CSA [touch or penetration only, or non-touch such as exposure to pornography], and risk factors that may become targets of prevention strategies). Such definitional debates impact all aspects of studying the concept, such as examining prevalence, assessment, and clinical interventions. Whether the perpetrators are known to the child (true in the majority of cases) or are strangers affects the length of time that the child is victimized sexually and whether and how they disclose the abuse. The sexual abuse of boys, while a relatively small proportion of sexual victimizations, was not given the attention it warranted until relatively recently. Perpetrators are both males and females (an estimated 20 percent), but the type of CSA differs based on the sex of the offender. Special circumstances in which CSA occurs include the abuse of children in institutions and the CSA of children with disabilities. Disclosing CSA is difficult for many children and, rather than directly disclosing, many mention the abuse indirectly or much later on. Once disclosed, intervention typically consists of child protection services assessment and trauma-focused counseling. Child advocacy centers (CACs) have become the standard agencies to investigate and support CSA victims and non-offending family members. There are a number of ways to provide CSA prevention programs, such as media education, but the most common approach is educating children about the risks and teaching them strategies that may assist them in avoiding abusers or seeking assistance early on. The launch of the Internet has introduced new ways to sexually abuse children, with easier access to child pornography, abuse in real time, and trafficking children for commercial sexual exploitation.",

      "title": "Biological sex differences relevant to mental health",
      "abstract": "Scientific interest in the effects of the female sex steroids on modulating mood and behaviour stems largely in the modern era from the well-recognized sex differences found in certain psychiatric disorders.The finding across many cultures and ethnic backgrounds from large epidemiological studies that women have twice the prevalence rate for depression as men, that this only becomes apparent after the onset of puberty, and that after the menopause rates return to near parity between the sexes, is a strong finding implicating a role for female gonadal hormones in playing an active part in such discrepancy. Further epidemiological evidence for sex steroids' capability to impact on mood and behaviour comes from the high rate of mood disturbance and psychosis seen in the postpartum period, a time of dramatic and rapid change in gonadal steroid secretion, in addition to the occurrence of a discrete menstrual cycle-related mood disorder (the premenstrual or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder), for which removal of the ovaries has been noted to be curative. Some conditions which may not be associated with a sex difference in lifetime prevalence rates are nevertheless associated with marked differences in course or outcome between the sexes, such as the later age of onset of schizophrenia in females, who generally manifest a less severe disorder which is more responsive to treatment, and who display a second peak onset around the time of the menopause, all suggestive of a somewhat protective role for gonadal steroids in this disorder.How do gonadal steroids have such widespread effects on the brain so as to explain these sex differences? While current knowledge is far from complete on this issue, this chapter will outline some key structural and functional differences between a female and male brain which arise due to the differential actions of the gonadal steroids. In particular, those central structures and systems which are believed to play an integral role in the psychiatric disorders for which a marked sex difference exists will be focused upon, including the limbic system, the various neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, and finally the neuroendocrine system involved in the stress response, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One hundred eighty-six children and adolescents at the first-, fifth-, eighth-, and 11th-grade levels were interviewed concerning occupational preferences. They were asked first what they would like to be when they grew up and second what they would like to be if they were members of the opposite sex. An examination of the traditionality of occupational choices revealed that significantly more females than males stated personal preferences for nontraditional occupations (i.e., occupations socially identified with the opposite sex of the S or with neither sex). Moreover, when projecting choices for the opposite sex, females generally selected traditional occupations for males, while a significant number of males nominated nontraditional occupations for females. The findings suggest that children of both sexes assume that males will enter careers that are sex-typed, while females may enter either sex-typed or non-sex-typed careers.",

Outcome information on patients with CAH often indicates poor quality of life, general maladjustment, problems with sexuality, and decreased fertility. With advances in medical treatment and surgery and changes in societal perspectives on gender and sexuality, there is a need for greater consideration of quality of life factors, including socialization and sexuality.",

The cohabitors felt repressed by authority and used marijuana, LSD, and speed with greater frequency than marrieds. They entered an ephemeral relationship with more previous sexual experiences of poor quality and were less committed to the relationship, although they were as faithful as married individuals while in the relationship. Cohabitors tended to be more dissatisfied with life, nonconforming, rebellious, fearful of close ties, withdraum, and more likely to experience internal conflicts and bizarre thoughts or behavior. They evidenced greater restlessness, impulsiveness, and scattered interests and energies. Their interpersonal relationships tended in the direction of superficiality, and attitudes of self-criticism seemed prevalent. Cohabiting males were more demanding, sensitive, idealistically and aesthetically inclined, blaming and touchy. Cohabiting females were more likely to be shy and retiring in unfamiliar situations than married females. In general, coha bitors tended to be more discouraged and less well-adjusted than marrieds.",

Such people often have a whole range of accompanying personality problems which may include egocentricity, exhibitionism, suggestibility, superficiality and a tendency to overdramatise things. Consequently the person usually has poor interpersonal relationships, little consideration for other people and an inability to tolerate frustration. There may be angry outbursts particularly if the person does not get his own way. Mood fluctuations can mean that the person is crying one moment and laughing the next. While such behaviour is of course possible in either sex, the literature points to a higher incidence among females. Such females frequently dress and act seductively in relation to males. Heavy makeup is often worn and manipulation is quite common. Such people have generally suffered from some kind of emotional deprivation during formative years. Present behaviour is unconsciously motivated by anxiety and a desire to be loved and cared for. The individual may have been denied the opportunity to experience feelings of security and consistency during the process of growing up. Unfortunately for the person concerned, attention-seeking behaviour often arouses negative feelings in others.",

      "title": "Support in Response to a Spouse's Distress: Comparing Women and Men in Same-Sex and Different-Sex Marriages",
      "abstract": "Accepted at the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships Abstract: Support for a spouse with psychological distress can be expressed in many different ways. Previous research indicates that support expression is shaped by gender, but we do not know much about how support within marriage is provided in response to a spouse’s distress outside of a different-sex couple context. In this study, we analyze dyadic data from 378 midlife married couples (35-65 years; N = 756 individuals) within the U.S. to examine how men and women in same- and different-sex relationships provide support when they perceive that their spouse is experiencing distress. We find women in different-sex couples are less likely to report taking care of their distressed spouse’s tasks or giving their distressed spouse more personal time and space compared to women in same-sex couples and men. We also find that men in different-sex couples are less likely to report encouraging their spouse to talk compared to men in same-sex couples and women. Being personally stressed by a spouse’s distress is positively associated with providing support to that spouse, whereas feeling that a spouse’s distress is stressful for the marriage is negatively associated with providing support. This study advances understanding of gendered provisions of support in response to psychological distress in marriage, moving beyond a framing of women as fundamentally more supportive than men to a consideration of how these dynamics may be different or similar in same- and different-sex marital contexts.",

      "abstract": "Introduction.So far we have spoken about social norms and standards of sexual behaviour.However, how these standards are reflected in our minds, and what lies in the basis of the sexual motivation of the individual remain open questions.Criticism of the instinctivist model of libido does not mean denying the biological determinants of sexuality.In the mid-1960s, R. Whalen proposed to replace the abstract concept of \"power of desire\" with a more specific concept of sexual excitability, i.e., readiness to respond to a sexual situation sexually and erotically.Sexual excitability has great individual variations determined by the physiological state of the body (hormonal balance and such) as well as the life (sexual, emotional, and communicative) experience of the subject and their non-sexual motives.According to R. Whalen, sexual arousal, i.e., current, temporary psychophysiological state, is a function of stable excitability of the subject, and particular given external and internal situation.Modern psychological literature describes sexual motivation in terms of the theory of needs, the theory of emotion, and cognitive psychology alike.However, the most productive theory in terms of opportunities for integrating psychological and sociological data is the theory of \"sexual script\" suggested by William E. Simon and John Gagnon.Presenting main material.As the special studies show, erotic dreams, night dreams, and fantasies are an essential aspect of our sexuality.They do not only substitute actual sex life or fill in its deficit, as S. Freud believed, but also constantly accompany it.More sexually active people also have more intense erotic imagination that supports, encourages and diversifies their real experience.For those brought up in Victorian spirit, the words \"erotic\" and \"eroticism\" sound as offensive phrases denoting something \"animal\" and low.In fact, animals do not know what eroticism is.The ability to not only respond to erotic signs and images, but also create them implementing your imagination is an exclusively human property, inherent to us, as the history of art says, from ancient times.Erotic images perform four main functions.First, they are all tools of cognition, displaying and capturing sexually significant properties and experiences.Second, they serve as a kind of psychological stimulants of sexual arousal.Third, they expand the",

In this study we examined experiences of intimate relationships and sexuality in 20 young men, aged 22–31 years, who had sexually offended during adolescence. The participants were interviewed and the transcripts were thematically analysed. The main picture observed was that of young men with unfulfilled needs and a low capacity to meet those needs. Additionally, the men’s experiences of intimate relationships and sexuality seemed to be affected by their experience of having sexually offended. Some men longed for closeness with a partner but were afraid of getting too close. Others distanced themselves from relationships, claiming that they did not need others. These findings may demonstrate the men’s self-protective strategies for handling their identification as sexual offenders. These 20 men could also have been struggling with universal questions about closeness and sexuality while bearing other burdens, such as mistrust in others and feelings of shame, that interfered with this struggle.",

      "title": "Incompetence and Sexual Consent",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter discusses four kinds of problem cases involving people who are, or who might be, incompetent to give valid consent to sex. The first section addresses intoxicated consent. It argues that the range of cases where it’s not sufficiently clear whether a person is too drunk to competently consent to sex is considerably larger than it might at first seem and that it’s wrong to have sex with someone when they’re intoxicated to such a degree even if they’re probably not too drunk to validly consent. The second section considers dementia and sexual consent. It argues that, under certain conditions, a competently signed sexual advance directive can make it permissible to have sex with someone who has subsequently developed dementia and argues that this position can plausibly be extended to some cases where no such directive was signed. The third section discusses pedophilia. It rejects the argument that says pedophilia is wrong because young children cannot currently give competent consent to sex and instead argues that it’s wrong because they can’t reasonably be expected to give their retroactive consent to it once they become competent adults. The fourth section addresses the case of people who are born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments. It argues, although tentatively, that under certain conditions, the sexual behavior of such people can count as a form of valid consent to sex or can at least play the same role that valid consent to sex plays.",

      "title": "Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire",
      "abstract": "Although sexual desire and romantic love are often experienced in concert, they are fundamentally distinct subjective experiences with distinct neurobiological substrates. The basis for these distinctions is the evolutionary origin of each type of experience. The processes underlying sexual desire evolved in the context of sexual mating, whereas the processes underlying romantic love—or pair bonding—originally evolved in the context of infant-caregiver attachment. Consequently, not only can humans experience these feelings separately, but an individual's sexual predisposition for the same sex, the other sex, or both sexes may not circumscribe his or her capacity to fall in love with partners of either gender. Also, the role of oxytocin in both love and desire may contribute to the widely observed phenomenon that women report experiencing greater interconnections between love and desire than do men. Because most research on the neurobiological substrates of sexual desire and affectional bonding has been conducted with animals, a key priority for future research is systematic investigation of the coordinated biological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes that shape experiences of love and desire in humans.",

      "abstract": "Many theories about play and the “reasons” investigators give for children’s play have slighted sex or gender differences to focus on the linguistic/cognitive and social skill developmental advantages that play offers. Play helps young children clarify and articulate similarities and differences in concepts and categories. Parental expectations from birth onward provide powerful incentives, both as direct reinforcers and models, for sharply divergent gender-role behaviors. The meaning of sex differences in play becomes profound for promoting divergence in developing interpersonal skills in contrast to skillful manipulation of objects in the physical world. Some theorists suggest that cognitive growth during the early years is deeply implicated in the marked separation by sex in play groups. Girls, compared with boys, also engage in different kinds of pretend or sociodramatic role-play. Sexual play that involves dominating or assaulting another child must be firmly forbidden, discussed, and handled by adults who establish clear boundaries and keep children safe from hurt.",

Of these, 23 estrangements were initiated by the participant and 16 were maintained by the participant after being initiated by the parent or occurring after a mutual lessening of contact. Participants reported three core reasons for estrangement: (i) abuse, (ii) poor parenting, and (iii) betrayal. However, estrangement was predominantly situated in long-term perceived or actual disconnection from the parent and family of origin. Most participants had engaged in cycles of estrangement and reunification, using distance to assess the relationship and attend to their own personal development and growth across time. Estrangement was generally triggered by a relatively minor incident or a more serious act of betrayal considered to have been enacted by the parent.",

      "title": "Perceptual Narrowing in Face Processing: Reviewing the Factors Influencing its Onset and Offset",
      "abstract": "Abstract An infant's face‐ and speech‐processing system develops during the first year from broad and non‐specific to becoming a system that is tuned to the faces and languages to which they are most exposed. This phenomenon is called perceptual narrowing. Before 9 months of age, infants are capable of discriminating and recognizing individuals from any type of race/species faces. However, with increased exposure to own‐race and own‐species faces and lack of exposure to other types of faces, by 9 months of age, they have improved their ability to discriminate own‐race faces, while they show increased difficulty in the discrimination of faces from other races and species. According to the literature, we can conclude that, by 12 months of age, most human perceptual systems have become perceptually tuned and adult‐like; however, this is not true. In the following sections, we will argue that perceptual narrowing for faces occurs during the same developmental period as it does for language, and that it can be prevented or modulated with sufficient exposure to unfamiliar sounds or face types. We conclude that narrowing has been designed by natural selection to tailor an individual's cognition to their local social context. It might occur for every domain pertaining to social communication—from speech processing to emotion or gesture perception—in a process that gradually adapts the infant to their native social group.",

      "abstract": "Animal models serve to imitate (patho)physiological states known to occur in target species (usually man but sometimes other species as well). The use of animal models has had and may continue to have a tremendous impact on medical progress. Laboratory animals are now used in the study of basic (patho)physiological mechanisms, in the development, production and evaluation of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, in safety studies to assess carcenogenic, teratogenic or reproductive toxicity of investigational agents, and in education and training. The quality or utility of a model often depends upon its validity, which is highest in so-called homologous models where the symptoms displayed as well as the cause of the condition in the animal are identical to those of the human condition. Isomorphic models display similar symptoms, but the condition is not provoked by the same events as the human condition. Partial models do not attempt to model the entire condition, but focus only on limited aspects. Models can be further classified into spontaneous, induced, negative and \"orphan\" models. Uncritical extrapolation of animal findings to the human condition may lead to unreliable or even dangerous conclusions. Extrapolation tends to be most reliable when a plurispecies approach is taken, and when differences in metabolic patterns and speed as well as several other confounding variables are taken into account. Animal models have been crucial to neurological and psychiatric research, even though the search for valid models has been difficult in these fields because of the differences in brain structure and function between humans and other species.",

      "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive function is affected by all aspects of cancer, including cancer’s biologic processes of growth and metastasis, the effects of undergoing cancer treatment, and the psychological issues that occur as a result of having cancer and receiving treatment for it. These aspects can result in changes in body appearance, infertility and sterility, and the inability to have intercourse. The changes may be made worse by additional alterations in body image, fears of abandonment, loss of self-esteem, changes in sexual identify, and concerns about self (Krebs, 2005). Human sexuality includes three separate but intertwined aspects: body image, reproductive ability, and sexuality or sexual functioning. Body image, or the way individuals see themselves or think others see them, may be altered by changes in body appearance resulting from weight loss or gain, alopecia, mucositis, fatigue, or a variety of other changes that may not be visible to others. Changes in self-esteem may occur as a result of body image alterations, resulting in decreased desire and decreased sexual activity. Reproductive function, or the ability to bear or father children, may become impossible as a result of therapyrelated infertility, and sexual functioning may be altered by changes in self-perception, decreased desire, general side effects of treatment (including cancer therapies and methods to manage side effects of therapy), or numerous other reasons. Some individuals are at higher risk for sexual side effects than others based on age, gender, type of cancer, type of cancer treatment, or concomitant medical or psychological illness (Krebs, 2001, 2005). See Figure 1 for a list of factors that contribute to sexual diffi culties.",

In some respects, the most surprising aspect of the scientific study of sex is the fact that it has taken place at all, that theories have been formulated and tested, and that empirical data have accumulated in a rapidly accelerating fashion over the last century. Human sexuality may be interwoven with love and many other splendored things or with hate and other totally nonsplendored things, but in either event it also remains a matter of some quite specific physical structures and functions. If biosexology can be characterized as emphasizing the similarities across species and among individuals, sociosexology takes a different conceptual set and emphasizes the differences.

Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one’s partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one’s sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

Without considering external factors (ethnicity, culture, religion, color, age or gender), each one of us are vulnerable to become victims of abuse. This type of abuse, involving sexual acts in a repetitive way or just once, is one of those who have the greatest impact in the life of a human being. Speaking of minors (children or adolescents) the problem is even greater, since at that age is a continuously development looking for safety, which is interrupted by the lack of other. The consequences are innumerable against an event of this magnitude and without treatment or adequate social and family support; the problem may become worse and completely can transform children´s life. Mainly by fear and the Satanism presented to this problem, is that many are afraid to speak or comment about it. This has meant that for years the secret of sexual abuse do not allow humanity to advance in a safety environments, but rather to pretend that what is happening it´s adequate.\r\nFor this reason, this research was made to develop a preventive workshop on child sexual abuse in children aged 8-10years.The workshop was decided to treat important themes around sexuality. The investigation method was made on pre and posts test with 13 multiple choice questions.

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A discreditable stigma is an attribute, characteristic, or identity that is socially devalued but can be concealed from or made invisible to others. People who are “marked” with one or more of these attributes typically come to occupy a lower social standing. Attributes such as physical illnesses, mental illnesses, identities, and significant or traumatic life experiences are considered to be discreditable in many cultural contexts. Because the discreditable can typically exert greater control over when, to whom, and how others in their social group or society come to know about the stigmatized attribute, informational control is an important and unique stigma management strategy and area of ongoing research.",

For classification purposes, the three basic physiologic deficits—excitement phase dysfunction, orgasmic phase dysfunction, and vaginismus—are subdivided into primary and secondary types. Primary dysfunctions represent longstanding developmental problems and are usually purely psychological in origin. Secondary dysfunctions occur after a period of normal sexual functioning and may be organic or psychological in origin. The actual determinants of dysfunctions are not well understood, but those factors commonly associated are discussed. The lack of knowledge about the nature of sexual desire, prevalence of dysfunctions, and significance of the inability to attain orgasm with coitus is emphasized. The physician's role in giving advice and treatment is defined.",

      "abstract": "A história da sexualidade humana é longa e complexa, e é influenciada por muitos fatores, incluindo a cultura, a religião, a política, a ciência e a tecnologia. Dentro do campo da sexualidade, a ejaculação precoce pode ter várias consequências negativas na vida de um homem, incluindo: ansiedade e estresse, problemas de relacionamento, problemas de saúde mental. A insatisfação sexual pode levar a uma diminuição do desejo sexual, tensão e ressentimento em um relacionamento. Em alguns casos, pode até levar a uma separação ou divórcio. Felizmente, existem várias opções de tratamento para ejaculação precoce, os homens podem procurar ajuda de um profissional de saúde e utilizar medicamentos prescritos, terapia comportamental ou uma combinação de ambos que auxiliarão no tratamento desse problema. Conclui-se que as consequências da ejaculação precoce nos homens, traz impactos negativos na satisfação sexual, saúde emocional e relacionamentos íntimos. Além disso, a ejaculação precoce pode desencadear ansiedade, estresse e baixa autoestima nos homens, afetando sua saúde emocional e bem-estar geral. Outra consequência relevante é o impacto nos relacionamentos íntimos, com a ejaculação precoce contribuindo para conflitos conjugais, diminuição da intimidade emocional e até mesmo o término de relacionamentos. The history of human sexuality is long and complex, and is influenced by many factors, including culture, religion, politics, science, and technology. Within the field of sexuality, premature ejaculation can have several negative consequences on a man's life, including anxiety and stress, relationship problems, and mental health problems.: Sexual dissatisfaction can lead to a decrease in sexual desire, tension, and resentment in a relationship. In some cases, it can even lead to a separation or divorce. Fortunately, there are several treatment options for premature ejaculation, men can seek help from a healthcare professional and use prescription medications, behavioral therapy, or a combination of both that will help treat this problem. It is concluded that the consequences of premature ejaculation in men have negative impacts on sexual satisfaction, emotional health, and intimate relationships. Furthermore, premature ejaculation can trigger anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem in men, affecting their emotional health and general well-being. Another relevant consequence is the impact on intimate relationships, with premature ejaculation contributing to marital conflicts, decreased emotional intimacy, and even the end of relationships.",

It also includes sexual criminality (crimes against sexual freedom and moral), which has highly negative impact on society and endangers the most intimate parts of a person’s life. The aim of this survey is to outline a structure of psychological features of sexual offenders, to determine the degree of their development and the way in which they are connected, as well as to describe certain social and sociological phenomena that are typical of sexual offenders. The results that have been achieved during this survey will successfully be implemented into the practical work of penal institutions in the Republic of Macedonia in order to ensure successful resocialisation and reintegration of sexual offenders in the society. Our experience and knowledge are compatible with world-wide trends saying that sexual offenders are mentally healthy people and that they cannot be included in any diagnostic category. The main results of this survey can be summed up into several points: in general, sexual offenders are male, aged between 26 and 33, with minimal education and without profession or employment. Usually, they do not behave in pathological manner and they are mentally healthy people. It is believed that resocialisation as well asa complex treatment will be necessary for people convicted of sexual offences: not only will it represent prevention from committing new crimes, it will also be a breeding ground for their active participation in life out of the penal institutions.",

A quantitative synthesis of published research showed, however, that the sex difference is age specific. There is little sex difference in either childhood or advanced old age, but a notable sex difference in middle life. This sex difference appears because rates for females rise sharply from childhood to adulthood and then decline somewhat in old age. By contrast, rates for males show a small rise in early adulthood but are otherwise fairly stable throughout life. The age-specific nature of these sex differences may be explainable in terms of differences in social roles at various ages.",

      "abstract": "Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could be a factor in later diagnosis of individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability, particularly among those assigned female sex at birth. Little research to date has examined how gender identity impacts camouflaging, however. Further, no study has compared groups that differ in diagnostic-timing to directly investigate if later-diagnosed individuals demonstrate elevated camouflaging relative to those receiving an earlier diagnosis. Using the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) subscales (Assimilation, Compensation, and Masking), we investigated the roles of sex, gender identity (gender diverse vs. cisgender), and diagnostic timing (childhood/adolescent-diagnosed vs. adult-diagnosed), and the interactions of these factors, in ASD adults (N=502; ages 18-49 years). Main effects of sex, gender identity, and diagnostic-timing were revealed. ASD females reported more camouflaging across CAT-Q subscales compared to males. Gender diverse adults reported elevated camouflaging on the Compensation subscale compared to cisgender adults. Adulthood-diagnosed individuals reported elevated Assimilation and Compensation compared to childhood/adolescence-diagnosed individuals. We discuss how the ‘performative’ aspects of camouflaging probed in the Assimilation and Compensation subscales may have particular implications for the intersection of neurodiversity and gender diversity, and for later diagnostic timing.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the research topic. It is very important that health has been considered the most important category of existence since the earliest periods of humanity. Culture is a measure of human development, human existence, and health culture is a measure of the attitude of a person and society to health, which, as noted by researchers, is conditioned by cultural discourses (concepts, knowledge) and acts as a phenomenon of social life, that is, the phenomenon of health reflects the historical trajectory of a person's vision of himself through the prism of certain health ideals that have developed over centuries and millennia in different societies and cultural areas. The purpose of the article is to determine the socio-pedagogical profile and motivation of men of the first period of mature age to engage in health fitness. Methods: analysis and generalization of specialized scientific literature, sociological methods. From the range of methods of statistical data processing, primary statistical processing of materials was used in the study. Results. The majority of the study participants were married or divorced, with unmarried men making up a much smaller proportion. Due to these circumstances, the most popular time for fitness classes for the study participants was weekends (for 90.9 %; n=30) and evening hours (for 97 %; n=32), while morning classes were less popular, with only 24.3 % (n=8) choosing it. If we compare the 26-28-year-olds and 29-31-year-olds, we can see that their social and pedagogical profiles do not differ significantly. According to the survey, both groups preferred weekends and evenings for fitness activities. Weekends were chosen by 87.5 % of men aged 26-28 (n=14), evening time by 100 % of them (n=16), and morning time by only 25 % (n=4). Similarly, older participants (29-31 years old) were more likely to train on weekends (94.12 %; n=16) and/or in the evening (94.12 %; n=16), while only 23.53 % of this group (n=4) found morning time attractive. Thus, both groups preferred weekends and evenings for fitness, and there was no significant difference between them (χ2=0.08; df=2; n=33; p&gt;0.05). Conclusions. It was found that 48.5 % of the respondents had an average level of assessment of their fitness training capabilities, and more than half of the men (51.5 %) demonstrated a low level of fitness self-esteem. These men had some concerns about their training and fitness.",

It examines the connection between these three dimensions, that is, the degree of concordance and overlapping between what one does, what one feels, and how one experiences one's identity. The chapter looks at the age at which adolescents have their first sexual experience with a person of the same sex, and how this compares with the age at which they feel they have established a more or less permanent identity as lesbian, gay or bisexual. It describes how this type of experience and patterns of desire or identity are linked to romantic relationships, sexuality and living patterns. Gender identity among adolescent and young adult women is to a lesser extent tied to absolute expectations and taboos in this area. There are also strong indications that males' homosexual encounters and identity are established earlier and perhaps more rapidly than that of females.",

      "title": "Methodology in sexuality research: how to build a valid road?",
      "abstract": "Sexology is a broad, interdisciplinary, field with a long tradition of empirical research.Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies have been conducted since the 20th century, providing abounding evidence.As the area is informed by diverse theoretical backgrounds, a wide range of methods have been applied to sex research over time.While the World Health Organization 1 claims that sexual health refers to a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in relation to sexuality, beyond the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity, most studies from the past decades have focused on sexual function and behavior.Broader aspects such as quality of sex life, sexual violence, sexual beliefs, and sexual satisfaction have received less attention.The narrowing of sexuality around sexual function might be misleading in the understanding of the sexual complaints that make a person seek for sexual healthcare.The inclusion of broader aspects might foster a more comprehensive perspective and produce more effective, culturally competent, treatment options.From Masters' and Johnson's observations in the 1960s until today, most of the knowledge available on sexual function and the psychophysiological processes involved in sexual response was derived from experiments that may seem exotic to a naïve observer.Unconventional instruments are used to measure participants' genital responses, like vaginal and penile plethysmographs or genital thermographs, and experimental tasks may include masturbating in the lab or watching a pornographic video, while monitored by eye-trackers, electroencephalography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging.Clinical trials on sexual medicine interventions have also risen in the last 30 years, driven mostly by efforts to develop medications for sexual disfunctions.Ethical guidelines limit the number of sexual behaviors that can be observed or experimentally manipulated in laboratory settings.Generalizability of these findings may additionally be biased by the artificial context and observer effects.Thus, for the study of sexual behavior, indirect observation is broadly used, with methods that include interviews, self-report questionnaires or retrieval of clinical records and public databases.Cross-sectional surveys are the most used alternative for obtaining information about sexual behavior and other dimensions of human sexuality.Robust estimates of the prevalence of sexual behaviors and their determinants in the population have been provided by surveys in the past years.Research strategies to minimize measurement error have been applied, from sample selection to questionnaire content, design, and data collection 2 .Random probability sampling methods are used to reduce volunteer bias.Volunteers in sex research tend to be more sexually experienced, sensation seeking, to have more relaxed sexual attitudes and behaviors than the general population.Achieving good response rates is thus essential to improve the representativeness of the survey and reduce participation bias.Nevertheless, recall and comprehension problems, as well as respondents' ambivalence to report socially sensitive information are still a challenge in these studies.Long questionnaires may also decrease data quality, due to missing data and inconsistent answers.To minimize that, sex researchers sometimes alternatively rely on methods like diary studies, which may require participants to self-monitor some aspects of their sexuality or relationships every day, for a period.",

Breastfeeding may influence psychosexual functioning at a variety of levels, from the individual to the relational. A number of physiological transitions take place after parturition and the initiation of breastfeeding that may affect sexual intimacy. Depressive symptoms may interfere with psychosexual functioning in both men and women. Breastfeeding and sexual intimacy are enacted within particular social and cultural contexts. Sexualization of the breast in Euro‐American societies creates psychological dissonance in a woman's perception of her dual identity as a mother and as a sexual partner. Social stigma also influences men's responses to sexual intimacy with a breastfeeding partner. Both long‐term and short‐term breastfeeding have been shown to improve sexual and emotional intimacy between mothers and fathers. More research is required to understand non‐heteronormative and adoptive breastfeeding in relation to psychosexual functioning.",

The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining \"normal\" sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.",

In modern society, particularly in big cities, albeit for very different reasons, children do not have time and space for childhood experience, and this is independent of gender or social classes. Experts in physical education believe that children today have been poorly developing motor skills. For them, the technology, the increase in violence and the limited understanding of the parents about the subject are the main causes. In adults, it is possible to notice that some have some sort of motor impairment in some activity or take longer to suit them. In this sense, the role of physical education in childhood is extremely important in children’s educational process as it promotes, through ludic activities, the means for a child to explore her body, as well as developing a range of motor skills that will last for all her life. This study aimed to verify the contributions of recreational activities through physical education for motor development of children from 5-6 years old and their effects in adulthood. This study has a qualitative approach and the method used was observational. The present study included some adult guests and parents of some students of the State School Professor Benicio Leao, situated in the south of Manaus. 16 sessions of motor activities with recreational aspects were performed with children. These activities took place on weekends, with 40 minutes long, so we could check if they would have the same difficulties of a child. The sessions were filmed for later analysis. In data analysis we used the content analysis, it was possible to identify the motor aspects. The motor aspect, we noted the interaction of different motor functions (perceptual-motor, neuromotor, psychomotor), adaptive, evolutionary and recreational process.",

With increased access to information and venues for self-expression, sexual minority populations are more visible among American society, with 4.5% of US adults openly expressing an LGBT identity, and 10.4% of high school youth identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Scholars have proposed several homosexual identity stage models to outline common developmental experiences among lesbian women and gay men. The stages of Cass's model are outlined in this chapter to aid in the assessment of a child named Savion's gay identity development. The chapter explains that evidence of feeling frustration, anxiety, and anger may be present, along with symptoms of nervousness. Acute stress is short term and helps anyone in dangerous situations, whereas chronic stress is over time and long term.",

      "title": "Online Child Safety from Sexual Abuse in India",
      "abstract": "1. Introduction The World Health Organization defines child sexual abuse as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person. This may include but is not limited to the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful activity, the exploitative use of a child in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices, the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials (1). A similar definition has been stated in Article 18 of The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, 2007 which is yet to enter into force (2). The risks that minors face online include sexual solicitation, exposure to problematic and illegal content as well as harassment and bullying. These risks are not confined to their local area but occur from people all around the world. Parents and teachers do not have direct experience with the risks posed by new-media technologies. Addressing the risks online therefore carries different challenges and requires broader collaboration to find innovative solutions (3). The need for a multi-layered approach to internet governance in India is highlighted by a comparative study of the various measures available internationally to make communications over the information and communication technologies safe. A concerted effort is very essential from various actors in order to prevent online child sexual abuse. Those who can help report child sexual abuse have been identified as social-service workers, healthcare practitioners, education providers, law enforcement officers, photo developers, IT professionals, ISPs, credit card companies and banks (4). Other actors are telecom service providers, network service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-market places, and cyber cafes. A multi-level sensitisation about the need to collect statistics as well as report suspected internet child abuse should be effected among these actors. In India, the government does not take a pro-active stand against child sexual abuse, in contrast to the USA where law enforcement officials lure potential sex offenders in decoy. In sting operations conducted in the USA, where paedophiles are lured over the internet to contact people below the age of consent over the Internet for sexual liaisons, many highly-educated and well-to-do Indians are turning up as potential molesters. This is particularly disturbing, as there are no statistics on this in India (5). Child-to-child solicitation and abuse through the medium of mobile telecommunications is becoming a serious problem in India. Other kinds of abuse occur through social networking sites like Orkut where pictures of girls have been posted on communities with lewd allusions and a listing of the victims' mobile numbers. With new-media technologies available at lower costs, child sex abuse images are being increasingly made and uploaded from India (6). In a recent case in Kerala State, three girls committed suicide after increasing blackmail that the film of classmates raping them which had been taken on a mobile camera would be publicly circulated. Generally, it is a fact that unwanted publicity and fear of victimisation by law enforcement machinery are reasons why the largely conventional Indian families fear reporting child sexual abuse. 2. A Comparative analysis regarding definition and criminalisation of Online Child Sexual Abuse The word 'online' means all forms of information and communication technologies like the internet, mobile phones etc. …",

      "abstract": "Pioneering research suggested that sexual afterglow (lingering sexual satisfaction following an act of sex) lasts 2 but not 3 days and predicts subsequent relationship satisfaction. Nevertheless, recent research highlights the importance of considering the differential impacts of sexual acceptance and rejection. We used 2-week, daily-diary data from 576 participants to demonstrate that sexual afterglow lasted at least 1 day on average, particularly following partner-initiated and mutually initiated sex, and did not depend on individual differences in the importance of sex or sexual rejection, though negative aftereffects of sexual rejection lasted 3 days. Furthermore, lingering sexual (dis)satisfaction often predicted subsequent relationship satisfaction. Mini-meta-analyses of the current data with all published data suggest sexual afterglow lasts at least 1 day and predicts relationship quality whereas sexual rejection did not reliably produce aftereffects. Conclusions focus future research on other factors that may contribute to differences in sexual afterglow and reactions to other discrete events.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIncest is a deviant behavior in the family, which can occur due to coercion or threats and occurs because of consensual elements. The main problem is that there are no criminal provisions governing incest that are committed consensual in adulthood, so studies are needed to provide solutions in resolving cases that occur in the future. The results of this study are that the Criminal Code only regulates acts of sexual immorality against biological children, stepchildren, adopted children or children who are in their care with an element of coercion but does not regulate consensual sexual relations (incest) that is committed consensual at an adult age which has implications for law enforcement difficulties if this case happened. The regulation in the future is to stipulate incest which is done voluntarily at the age of adulthood as a crime. AbstrakHubungan sedarah (incest) sebagai perilaku menyimpang dalam keluarga, yang dapat terjadi karena adanya paksaan atau ancaman dan terjadi karena unsur suka sama suka. Problem utamanya adalah tidak ada ketentuan pidana yang mengatur hubungan sedarah (incest) yang dilakukan suka sama suka pada usia dewasa, sehingga perlu dilakukan kajian guna memberikan solusi dalam penyelesain kasus yang terjadi di masa yang akan datang. Hasil dari penelitian ini adalah KUHP hanya mengatur perbuatan pencabulan pada anak kandung, anak tiri, anak angkat atau anak yang berada dalam pengasuhannya dengan unsur paksaan tapi tidak mengatur hubungan sedarah (incest) yang dilakukan suka sama suka pada usia dewasa berimplikasi pada kesulitan penegakan hukum bila terjadi kasus ini. Pengaturan di masa yang akan datang adalah menetapkan hubungan sedarah (incest) yang dilakukan suka sama suka pada usia dewasa sebagai tindak pidana.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes age-related changes of psychol ogical well-being of an individual in middle and late adulthood. It is rev ealed that dissociated structure of psychological well-being that is characteristic of the second half of the middle adulthood (ages 50 to 59) is getting more integrate during la te adulthood, reaching integration peak at the age of 66–69 years. Such structure is suppor ted by expressed orientation of an individual to the communication motive and is regul ated by self-confidence and self- respect of a person under conditions of absence of inner conflicts and self-accusations. For women it is more important to have a positive s elf-attitude, while for men – not to have negative one. During pre-peak period (ages 5 0 to 59) experience of psychological well-being rolls out at the background of the weakl y expressed tendency to decrease the motive of general activity; in post-peak period ( ages 70 to 79) motivational profile of a personality becomes little differentiated. In both cases individual’s self-confidence is growing, however, the position of inner independenc e and autonomy is lost. The conclusion is made that the age of 66–69 years is t he most favorable period of late adulthood from the viewpoint of integrity of psycho logical well-being of a person. Psychological accompaniment of positive functioning of women lies in the correction of negative self-attitude (ages 50 to 59), protection of inner world from excessive external interference (ages 60 to 65), stimulation of positi ve self-attitude (ages 66 to 69), combination of positive self-attitude stimulation a nd negative self-attitude correction (ages 70 to 79). There is a different strategy of w orking with men: support of positive self- attitude (ages 50 to 59), negative self-attitude co rrection (ages 60 to 69), protection of inner world from external interference (ages 70 to 79).",

They begin their emotional lives in the orbit of women, whom they are like in many respects. Like hormones, psychological male principles have to be introduced into their experience and their psyches if they are to feel like men one day. In the case of the mind, it is largely the father who is the agent of a boy's masculine development. A consideration of fathers, like mothers before them, is essential to an understanding of the psychology of men. Moreover, a conventionality seemed to be built into the very notion of adult development, which in the 1980s had seemed so radical and liberating to psychoanalysts. In the absence of clearly defined biological maturation, adult men's negotiation of both potential milestones and unique challenges in the unfolding of their lives seemed less driven by a pre-wired epigenesis than by adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Emerging adulthood is a developmental period characterized by the exploration, shaping, and negotiation of many aspects of identity, including religiousness and spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Such aspects of one’s identity have implications for psychological and sexual well-being. Previous research has indicated that religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity may have implications for sexual well-being and sexual distress. However, the intersectional relationships between these aspects of identity and sexual distress among emerging adults have yet to be investigated. Accordingly, the current study examined the role of religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity in predicting sexual distress in emerging adults. A sample of 266 adults aged 18–30 years old completed an online survey assessing sexual distress, various dimensions of religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis indicated that minority sexual orientation and four dimensions of religiousness/spirituality (daily spiritual experiences, forgiveness, religious and spiritual coping, and religious support) significantly predicted greater sexual distress. These results indicate that sexual distress is minimally influenced by sexual orientation, thus suggesting that specific aspects of religiousness/spirituality may be important for buffering against sexual distress among emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "According to our literature analysis, there are no data focused on spermatozoa emotional representations in childless men and data on the emotional repercussions of a diagnosis of infertility on men are still scarce. Thus, in this work, we investigated what the presence or absence of spermatozoa in the semen symbolize for men.To answer this question, 441 childless heterosexual men participated in an anonymous, prospective, Internet-based survey.In response to the question \"What would having a high or normal sperm count symbolize for you?\" the most frequent answer was \"ability to father a child\". Men living with a partner were significantly more likely than single men to answer \"ability to father a child\" (p < 0.05) and less likely to answer \"virility\" and/or \"ability to have an erection/ejaculation\" (p = 0.001). In response to the question \"If you found out that you had a low sperm count or no spermatozoa at all, how would you feel?\", most of the men stated that they would be disappointed. Men living with a partner were more likely to state that they would feel ashamed (p < 0.05) or guilty with regard to their partner (p < 0.0001).These preliminary results should help us to improve (i) the way that male infertility is announced (it is easier to find the right words if one understands the possible importance of having a high sperm count) and (ii) the psychological, marital and sexual counselling provided to men with a diagnosis of infertility.Dans la littérature, peu d'articles traitent du ressenti des hommes vis à vis de leurs spermatozoïdes. Que signifie pour un homme “avoir ou non des spermatozoïdes”? Voilà la question que nous nous sommes posée.Pour y répondre nous avons élaboré un questionnaire qui a été rempli en ligne par 441 hommes hétérosexuels âgés de 18 à 45 ans et sans enfants.A la question, “que signifie pour vous avoir des spermatozoïdes?”, la majorité d’entre eux a répondu “être père”. Les hommes en couple ont statistiquement répondu plus fréquemment “être père” (p < 0.05) et significativement moins fréquemment “être un (vrai) homme”, “être viril”, “être capable d’avoir une érection/éjaculation” comparativement aux hommes célibataires (p = 0.001). A la question, “qu’ éprouveriez vous si on vous annonçait que vous n’aviez pas de spermatozoïdes ou moins que la normale?” la majorité d’entre eux à répondu “je serais déçu”. Les hommes en couples ont répondu significativement plus fréquemment qu’ils se sentiraient honteux (p < 0.05) ou coupables vis à vis de leur partenaire (p < 0.0001).Ces résultats préliminaires doivent nous aider à mieux comprendre le ressenti des hommes vis à vis de leurs spermatozoïdes et nous aider, nous spécialistes de l’infertilité, à mieux annoncer des infertilités par azoospermie ou oligospermie en adoptant une démarche de conseil psychologique, sexuel et conjugal dans l’annonce de cette infertilité masculine. En effet “ne pas avoir un nombre élevé de spermatozoïdes et a fortiori ne pas en avoir du tout” peut avoir un impact négatif sur l’homme en termes d’humeur, de culpabilité et d’estime de soi.",

      "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to explore the sexuality of individuals with psychopathic traits. Sexuality is not only a physiological need but also a way by which people connect to others. According to a Darwinian perspective, psychopathic traits are seen as adaptive responses to environmental conditions, and as a nonpathological and reproductively viable life history strategy, although superficial emotionality and a detached interpersonal style characterise individuals who are high on psychopathic traits. Design/methodology/approach Data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development are analysed. This is a prospective longitudinal study of 411 London males, with face-to-face interviews from 8 to 48 years of age. Findings Men who are high on psychopathic traits were likely to drift from one relationship to another, without a particular attachment to any of them, and to be sexually promiscuous. They never used contraception, which increased their likelihood of having several children from different partners. Practical implications Findings provide an insight into the non-criminal sexual behaviour of males with high psychopathic traits; evidence on a pattern of unsafe/risky sexual relations by males with high psychopathic traits; information on targeting risk factors to prevent the intergenerational transmission of psychopathy. Originality/value These findings are significant in highlighting the impact of psychopathic traits upon interpersonal and family dynamics in community samples, as detecting the impact of problematic intimate relationships is difficult in the absence of evident criminality. Rather than completely neglecting their children, men with psychopathic traits spent time with their sons but not with their daughters.",

      "title": "Stress, gender and psychopathology: a multi-level analysis",
      "abstract": "It seems that no matter where we look, stress exerts strong effects on the physiology and psychophysiology of an organism. Although beneﬁcial in the short run it is not surprising that long term stress can disturb the natural equilibrium state of an animal, given it’ s effects on the extended range of pararameters (systemic, endocrinological, cellular, molecular. The most interesting observation however was that females consistently showed an opposite or different effect than males. With regard to the question of which sex is more or less susceptible to stress, it appears this answer is thus less clear-cut than we would hope. While stress seems to affect transcriptional activity and cellular signal transduction in males, females appear more vulnerable to the negative stress effects on cell birth and/or survival. The manner in which HPA axis activity is affected in males and females is a testimony to this gender-differential regulation, since both sexes seem to indicate prolonged HPA axis overactivity, albeit in a sex-speciﬁc manner. The question we should therefore focus on is not which sex is more vulnerable, but how do the sexes differ in their vulnerabilities. It is more insight into this matter that may ultimately lead to way to new and improved drug development that considers sex speciﬁc neural circuits implicated in stress response regulation. Perhaps one day we can even speak of customized drug design, targeted to meet gender speciﬁc disturbances.",

      "title": "Developmental trajectory of substance use disorders: what role do the parents play (or are perceived to play)?",
      "abstract": "The aetiology of substance use disorders is considered to be multi-factorial as the individual, developmental and contextual dimensions interact together. From the developmental perspective, research has identified several aspects of family environment that are consistently associated with substance use disorders. Parent child interaction and parenting style are the primary focus of research. A conflict ridden and highly authoritarian parent child interaction predicts substance use in the future1. On the other hand, parenting style can both be a risk or a protective factor depending on its characteristics. Parental warmth as well as limit setting could be protective for future substance use2.\r\n\r\nParenting style is not a unitary concept. It is largely dependent on direct factors like parental personality, psychopathology, and substance use and on the indirect effects of other contextual factors like low socio-economic status (LSES), minority status, immediate environmental adversities and children's maladaptive behaviour3. Parental substance use has been consistently linked to substance use in the offspring4,5. Addicted mother's parenting has been characterized by a wide range of deficits starting from neglect, physical or emotional abuse, punishments to excessive control, lack of emotional involvement and inconsistent discipline2. In addition, parental psychopathology like depression, anxiety or antisocial personality and poor coping with stress has been demonstrated to be related with substance use disorders in their children4,6. But this indictment of the parents needs to be seen in the light of the various contextual factors2. This proposition could be more appealing in the traditional societies where there is interdependence and family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. These traditional societies are collectivist (with a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others, and where collective values of the family take precedence over individual values in case of a conflict) that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity7.\r\n\r\nIn the article by Pettenon & colleagues published in this issue8, the perception of parental bonding has been compared between crack cocaine users and non-illicit drug users. The authors examined hospitalized cocaine dependent subjects and non-illicit drug users as control subjects, both from the same geographical area with matched demographic characteristics. Parental bonding instrument (PBI)9 was used to assess various parenting style in both the parents. PBI measures two constructs: care and control. With various permutation and combinations of these constructs, four different styles of parenting are possible: optimal parenting (high care, low control), affectionate control (high care, high control), affectionless control (low care, high control) and neglectful parenting (low care, low control)9. Results of this study demonstrated that crack cocaine users were more likely to perceive their mothers as neglectful and their fathers as carelessly controlling. On the other hand, non-illicit drug users were perceived to have optimal parenting. This study has highlighted the importance of parenting style in the developmental trajectory both as risk factors (for cocaine users) and perhaps as protective factors (for the control subjects) for development of later substance dependence.\r\n\r\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted on an exclusively male clinical sample selected by non-random purposive method. As already acknowledged by the authors, these factors have curbed the generalizability of the study and its strength to establish causality8. But, by choosing clinical population the authors perhaps were able to tap the most severe end of the spectrum of substance use disorder which could be assumed to be homogeneous. They had a reasonably large sample size seemingly adequate for the purpose of the study. To eliminate the effects of the contextual factors like LSES, ethnic minority or adverse residential environment, the study subjects and the controls were matched as per their socio-demography. Hence, the result of ‘disordered’ parental bonding in the cocaine dependent subjects was unlikely to be due to other contextual variables. Additionally, exclusion of these contextual factors has made the association of impaired parental bonding with substance dependence more specific. Nevertheless, there are a few caveats in the study. As the authors have only studied subjects with substance use disorder, there is always a possibility of subjective bias coloured by subjects’ personality and personal experience. Concurrent interview of the parents could have eliminated this possibility. The subjects with cocaine dependence had significantly higher psychiatric co-morbidity than the controls. As it has been amply researched that psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to childhood adversities and impaired parenting, presence of these co-morbidities perhaps confounded the association of parenting style and cocaine dependence10,11. However, epidemiological studies have shown that almost half of those having substance use disorders have a mental illness in their lifetime. The risk of developing a mental illness is 2-4 times more common in subjects with substance dependence than the controls12,13. Hence, it would practically be impossible to find out a substance use disorder group which does not differ significantly from controls with regard to the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is a philosophical controversy in any research directed to the area of parenting style and future psychopathology. The controversy pivots around causality. One is reminded of Freida Fromm-Reichmann's theory of ‘schizophrenogenic mother’, which stated that schizophrenia is ‘caused’ due to unconscious rejection by the mother of the child (who later grows up to develop schizophrenia)14. A commentator has recently observed on its current status: “Today, in light of what we now understand about schizophrenia, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother seems hopelessly mistaken, and more than a little embarrassing”15. Likewise, one has to be careful in the interpretation of this study findings, lest ‘affectionless’, ‘controlling’ and ‘neglecting’ parents are easily labelled as ‘addictogenic’. This could have the appalling potential to inflict pain and burden to the parents who were and would be the primary caregiver for their kids. ‘Blaming’ the parenting style and family interaction for addiction in other family members could, therefore, be a double edged sword and might well be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to remember that the parenting styles reported in this study8 are ‘perceived’ parenting styles rather than actually observed parenting styles. Such perceptions can be distorted through the looking glass of chronic addiction. It is extremely difficult to conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to settle this issue. In an exceptional 30-year prospective study published very recently, unsupportive maternal behaviour, actually observed and rated by a developmental psychologist at eight months of age of the infant, predicted mental health problems in the grown up adults 30 years later16. Such studies are rare to come by. ‘Perceived’ parenting styles in a retrospective recall design cannot, and should not, implicate causality of addiction as ‘addictogenic’ parents. The value of the current study8, therefore, does not lie in inference of causality of any sort, but in the very fact that these ‘perceived’ parenting styles can have important bearing on the course and outcome of the subjects’ substance use trajectory. These need to be considered in the therapy of these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present study by Pettenon & colleagues8 is from Brazil, which is one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries which are developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies. All these countries have their commonalities in the primacy of family or collectivistic society over the individualistic society. Hence, the results of this study could be equally relevant and meaningful for Indian context.",

      "title": "Behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation across adolescence and adulthood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Social subjugation is a very significant and natural stressor in the animal kingdom. Adult animals defeated and subjugated during establishment of dominance hierarchies or territorial encounters can be highly submissive in future agonistic interactions. While much is know about the biological and behavioral consequences of winning and losing fights in adulthood, little is known about adolescence; a developmental period noted for impulsivity and heightened agonistic behavior. The present studies were undertaken to determine if the behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation are comparable in adolescent versus adult Syrian golden hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ). Male siblings were studied from adolescence into adulthood following exposure to counterbalanced episodes of either a benign stressor, i.e., isolation in a novel cage, or the more severe stressor of social subjugation. Results As adults, hamsters with a history of social subjugation in adolescence show high levels of aggression toward intruders as compared to siblings subjugated in adulthood. Sibling controls subjugated in adulthood are highly submissive with little or no aggressive behavior. However, when subjugated in adulthood, hamsters with the earlier history of subjugation are no different than their sibling controls, i.e., adult subjugation promotes submissive behavior. Sexual motivation is high in adult hamsters with adolescent subjugation and testosterone levels remained stable over adulthood. In contrast, sibling controls subjugated in adulthood show lower levels of sexual motivation and reduced levels of testosterone. Release of cortisol during agonistic encounters is blunted in animals subjugated in adolescence but not adulthood. Measures of anxiety are reduced in hamsters with adolescent subjugation as compared to their sibling controls. Conclusion These data demonstrate a pronounced difference in behavior and neuroendocrinology between adolescent and adult hamsters in their response to social subjugation and suggest adolescence is a resilient period in development.",

      "abstract": "Sexual StimuliSex stimulants are about us all the time.A man's or woman's mien, dress, hair style, gait, head carriage, voice, and bodily proportions have their sexual connotations.Some people consciously or unconsciously emphasize the erotic signals.They may do this with dress, cosmetics, perfumes, and manner- isms.There is a cult of long hair, moustaches, and beards for men, while women may discard their bras and roll-ons.There are colourful clothes for both sexes, and they are cut and tailored in various ways to emphasize parts of the body, especially the breasts, buttocks, and back in women, and muscularity and the genitalia in men.All these are attention catchers.Not all such signals affect the same or the opposite sex in the same way.There is, for instance, an obvious generation gap.One person's sexual meat may be another's poison.Fur and hair may be powerful erotic stimuli or of little significance to different individuals.Each person is individually conditioned.This process begins with the family and school and continues at work and through the communications media.Even the daily press now carries articles on sexual behaviour, and there is little doubt that many of them are designed for titillation rather than education and instruction.This proceeds further with the overtly sexual photographs and advertisements.Further along the range are the more or less avowedly sexual magazines, both for men and for women.These always have articles OD sexual topics, pictures, and advertisements, though a few throw in some non-sexual themes to give an air of respectability to themselves and their readers.The advertisements may, and often do, suggest ways to improve sexual performance.Most of these are spurious, involving doubtful creams and sprays for application to the genitalia.Some preparations are recommended to be taken orally, and they are usually harmless combinations of vitamins, minerals, and foodstuffs, for which there is no real proof of efficacy.Sexual stimuli are purveyed by television, radio, stage plays and shows, and strip clubs and pubs.There are camera clubs and models, films, sauna baths, topless bars and restaurants, and brothels.There is a spectrum running from the public sexual stimulation of dress, cosmetics, dancing, and bathing to the private sexuality of monogamous couples, and ultimately to the extreme privacy of self-stimulation.",

Still, it is unclear whether this inhibitive role also includes common, normative sexual behavior, particularly in secularized contexts. Moreover, the possible mediating effects emotions, affects, and thoughts have on the association between religiosity and restricted sexuality have never been integrated into a single model. Finally, cross-religious differences in common sexual behavior have still yet to be documented. We addressed these three issues in two studies, with samples of Catholic and Muslim tradition (total N = 446). Consistently across samples, religiosity predicted, either directly or indirectly, less frequent common heterosexual behaviors and masturbation, partly through sexual guilt and inhibition, and/or decreased sexual fantasy and the search for sexual pleasure. However, married Muslims’ religiosity, unlike Catholics’, did not directly undermine fertility-oriented sexuality and the search for pleasure. Religion's role in restricting sexuality seems to be rooted in deep psychological rationale.",

      "abstract": "Discussions of sexual misconduct often focus primarily or exclusively on the parties directly involved in sexual behavior. As a result, the discussion generally centers on consent. While consent is critically important, this Article instead focuses on harms to third parties resulting from sexual behavior—regardless of whether that behavior is consensual. Doing so reveals a dynamic that the conversation about sexual misconduct has not yet fully acknowledged: the presence or absence of consent between participants does not determine whether third parties suffer harm. Sexual behavior does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a particular context and often has significant consequences for other individuals beyond the participants in the behavior.Sexual behavior is problematic when it involves what this Article will refer to as an institutional power disparity: that is, one participant has power over the other as a result of their institutional roles. Institutional power disparities are inherent, for example, in sexual behavior involving a supervisor and their subordinate or a professor and their student.Such behavior risks significant harm to third parties within the institution. Third parties may be injured as a result of sexual favoritism. For example, a worker may be passed over for a promotion in favor of a less qualified worker who is having sex with the boss. Or third parties may suffer harm from a sexualized institutional environment. For example, students may avoid professors who are known for pursuing sexual relationships with students or may find it alienating to be viewed as a professor’s prospective sexual partner. And the institution itself may suffer harm when sexual behavior involving an institutional power disparity interferes with worker productivity and morale, or with student learning and intellectual growth.Harm to third parties justifies regulation of sexual relationships in the context of an institutional power disparity. In some circumstances, such relationships should be prohibited so long as the institutional power disparity remains. In other circumstances, careful regulation can mitigate potential harms to third parties and to the institution itself.",

      "title": "Toward a Definition of “Hypersexuality” in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Recent psychiatric literature has used the term \"hypersexuality\" to denote pathologically increased sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Various patterns of increased sexuality have been described in youth, including sexuality that is excessive, developmentally precocious, compulsive, aggressive, or otherwise socially inappropriate. Such \"hypersexual\" behavior in children and adolescents is associated with a variety of factors. Social factors include sexual abuse, physical abuse, life stress, and impaired family relationships. Psychiatric factors include emotional and behavioral problems in general, posttraumatic stress disorder and dissociative symptoms in particular, and possibly bipolar disorder. Despite the importance of increased sexual behavior in youth as a possible sign of these problems, there is currently no uniform definition in psychiatric literature of the term \"hypersexuality\" applied to children and adolescents. The usefulness of this term depends upon the degree to which it can be defined, measured, and distinguished from non-pathological juvenile sexual behavior. Research instruments are described that may be useful in measuring levels of sexual behavior in children and adolescents. Elements of a definition of juvenile hypersexuality are proposed based upon current knowledge about children and adolescents' sexuality in both normal development and a variety of conditions in which it is increased. Care is warranted in distinguishing between normal and abnormal sexual behavior in youth because of the variety of factors that can affect its measurement.",

      "title": "Establishing and asserting masculinity in Canadian penitentiaries",
      "abstract": "Prisons housing adult men have been identified as hypermasculine environments. As a gender process, masculinities are influenced by a multitude of factors. Although presentations of masculinities vary across men and over time, researchers have identified some shared masculine ideals many men try to embody. As a subset, the hegemonic or dominant form of masculinity includes elements that ensure a level of domination is held by those who embody certain traits, particularly within the context of gendered social relations. The tools and strategies prisoners use to exert or shape their masculinity within the prison social structure, however, have not yet been examined in the context of Canadian federal prisons housed in Ontario. Within the prison culture, I argue, hegemonic masculinities determine social interactions and enforce a hierarchy among prisoners where power and domination are asserted through physical, psychological and material means. How masculinities are manifested and exerted as well as how they governed social relations with other prisoners were investigated through in-depth face-to-face interviews with 56 Canadian ex-prisoners. Findings suggest 'prison' masculinities are contextually influenced and exaggerate traditional constructs of masculinity evident in larger society. The hypermasculine nature of the prison experience, the oppressive and hierarchical nature of masculinities in prison and the limited opportunities for the expression of masculinities by prisoners are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Adult men of different ethnic backgrounds who experienced childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may vary in their reports of the psychological and behavioural impact of CSA on their lives. Empirical studies rarely examine the impact of race/ethnicity or cultural context on the psychological and behavioural struggles of adult male CSA survivors. This study utilised qualitative content analysis to examine the reported CSA-related psychological and behavioural challenges of 150 US men, with equal numbers of Blacks, Latinos and non-Latino Whites. Interview data revealed some ethnic differences: Black men more frequently denied having present day adverse effects than other groups. However, Black men who did report negative consequences of CSA discussed difficulties with substance use and hyper-sexualised behaviour more often than other ethnicities. Latino men reported anger, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks and communication problems more often than the other two groups. Black and Latino men also discussed guilt/shame issues and sexual identity concerns more often than Whites did. In contrast, White men more frequently discussed issues related to low self-esteem, loneliness and isolation. These findings suggest that ethnically diverse men may respond differently to CSA experiences and that considerations need to be taken into account when providing healthcare to men with CSA histories.",

Ninety children, 4, 5, and 6 years old, rated the secrecy of items from an adult-validated list of personal information about an age- and gender-appropriate puppet. Two factors of the children's data corresponded to the adult categories of nonsecrets and secrets, and a third factor corresponded to surprises. All ages rated surprises as significantly more secret than nonsecret items; however, the surprise items contained linguistic cues to secrecy. A tendency to rate nonsecrets as secret decreased with age, but only the 6-year-olds rated secrets other than surprises as significantly more secret than nonsecrets. Thus, children acquire the implicit rules defining secret content from a somewhat later age than that reported for the cognitive or behavioral capacities for secrecy.",

      "abstract": "Research on close relationships in later life has received increased attention over the past decade. However, little is known about sexuality and intimacy in old age. Using cross-sectional data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II; Mage = 68 years, SD = 3.68; 50% women; N = 1,514), we examine age differences in behavioral (sexual activity), cognitive (sexual thoughts), and emotional (intimacy) facets of sexuality and investigate associations with physical health and psychosocial resources for successful aging. Older age was associated with less sexual activity and fewer sexual thoughts, but not with differences in intimacy. Relative to a reference sample of 22- to 36-year-olds within BASE-II (N = 475), the average older adult reported considerably fewer sexual activity and thoughts (ds > .60), but only slightly lower intimacy (d = .20). Substantial heterogeneity existed among older adults, with almost one third of the 60- to 82-year-olds reporting more sexual activity and thoughts than the average younger adult. Examining correlates of sexuality among older adults revealed that, covarying for diagnosed illnesses and performance-based grip strength, psychosocial factors (e.g., partnered, relationship satisfaction) accounted for considerable shares of variance in sexual activity and intimacy, whereas age and gender explained more of the variance in sexual thoughts. Some psychosocial factors exhibited similar-sized associations with all sexuality facets, whereas other factors operated in more facet-specific ways. To illustrate, participants reporting more loneliness also reported less sexual activity and less intimacy, but not fewer sexual thoughts. We discuss implications of our findings for theories of successful aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

In any food containing the necessary nutrients the brain to produce a chemical substance as the base material neurotrasnmiter, which makes it possible to enhance the individual's mental tasks, the content of these nutrients will also affect the formation of emotional processes in the brain, especially the emotional aggression. Aggressiveness is the behavior of physical violence or verbal against other individuals or objects, aggression as behavior that is deliberately intended to injure another person (physically or verbally) or destroy property. Aggressive behavior that often appears in the media and sticking out in various corners of the country, not only due to mere social phenomenon, but is caused by three interrelated factors that influence organobiologis related to biological and genetic factors a person, who touched second psikoedukatif aspects of parenting and education since the age of the children in the family, child growth and development of psychiatric conditions; third is sociocultural and spiritual related to social conditions in society.

This chapter discusses the specific discussion of sensory impairments in order to highlight areas of divergence in experience, but the reader must note that much of the discussion of sexuality and disability broadly is relevant to people with sensory impairments. Sexuality is constructed as something that is dependent on ability, vitality and conventional standards of beauty and performances of gender. Disability is constructed as something which renders one weak, dependant and tragic or childlike. As in the case of physical disability, most people with intellectual disabilities strive for, and want, 'autonomy, sex, secrets and desire in their lives'. As is apparent, research on sexuality in the context of disability is marked by a number of intersecting themes, many of which are characteristic of ongoing, seemingly intractable problems with which the field must grapple. Structural barriers are very much interlinked with the attitudinal barriers encountered by people with disabilities.",

Risky sexual behaviour (RSB) is any activity that places an individual(s) at risk of, potential or actual, undesirable outcomes (e.g. contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus or unwanted pregnancy). RSB substantially contributes to disease burden. RSB is a complex phenomenon that encompasses three individual, but overlapping, dimensions – human behaviour, sexual pleasure and voluntary risk taking. All three dimensions of RSB are subjected to influence by several factors – biomedical, psycho-socio-cultural and interpersonal. Acknowledging the complexity of RSB, eliciting a thorough biopsychosexual history, and duly addressing the factors associated with RSB are essential to have effective risk reduction strategies for STIs within an oral health clinical setting and to promote safe sex practices at a public health level.",

However, little research investigates how parents who were adolescents when they had children (early parents) talk with their teens about sex. In-depth interviews were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 29 parents of seventh graders. Salient themes of conversations with adolescents were risks of early parenthood, sexually transmitted infections, delaying sex, and using protection. Compared with parents who were older when they had children (later parents), early parents were more likely to report having had negative sexuality communications with their families of origin and to express a wish to communicate differently with their own children. Early parents were more likely than later parents to discuss risks of early parenthood and to rely on extended family involvement in sexuality communication. Findings suggest that early parents may bring unique perspectives that enable them to approach sexuality communication differently than do later parents.",

The former were assumed to be more biologically determined than the latter whereas overt behavioral responsiveness was presumed to be more affected by societal norms than were psychophysiological indices. The subjects were boys and girls in middle childhood and early adolescence. Psychophysiological indices showed that children, like parents, responded differentially to infant smiles and cries. As predicted, there were no sex differences on psychophysiological measures of responsiveness to babies. When permitted to interact with a baby, however, girls interacted more and ignored less than boys did. The results suggest that sex differences in overt responsiveness to babies are attributable to societal pressures rather than innate factors. Sex differences appear to wax and wane depending on the salience of sex stereotypy in differing developmental phases.",

These problems may be associated with several physical factors such as oestrogen deficiency, menstrual difficulties or surgical menopause. Furthermore, some of the psychological and psychosocial factors, such as a negative attitude towards sex and menopause, conflicts between partners, lifestyle factors and culture, can also cause psychosexual problems in menopausal women.",

An increasing number of spouses are coming out, yet the phenomenon remains little known. Disclosing spouses generally find supporting organizations, while their heterosexual spouses find little support or understanding of their issues. Isolated, most cope alone. Dealing with sexual rejection, the challenge to the marriage, and, if they have children, spouse/parent conflicts is followed by handling questions about their own identity, integrity, and belief system. This piece describes issues that heterosexual spouses typically face and stages through which they move from survival to reconfiguring their lives whether or not they stay married. Peer support helps this process that lasts several years or more. Knowledge about spouse's concerns assists therapists working with spouses to help them resolve potentially paralyzing pain, anger, grief, or fear.",

The first is the lie of the male orgasm, which is experientially neither synonymous with ejaculation nor at any point inevitable or uncontrollable.

      "title": "The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness",
      "abstract": "Whore means prostitute. And a prostitute is a woman who offers to hire her body for indiscriminate sexual intercourse, or so says The Concise Oxford Dictionary. Prostitute is further defined as a verb: to prostitute oneself is to sell one's honor for base gain or to put one's abilities to infamous use. Other dictionaries include men1 secondarily in the noun definition and specify in the verb definition the shame attached to dishonor and the unworthiness and wrongdoing attached to infamous use. The noun clearly denotes a person, especially a woman, offering heterosexual sex, in particular intercourse, for money; the verb denotes any person's activity, which need not be sexual, put to uncommendable use. Those meanings are likely to conform to popular opinion except that many people collapse the second definition into the first. A prostitute then becomes one who sells her honor by offering to hire her body for base gain or for an unworthy doing, specifically sexual intercourse. The following discussion will begin by comparing the dictionary's noun definition with the actual behavior of prostitutes. Since a whore is a prostitute, both words will be used interchangeably throughout this text. Actual whore life is described for the purpose of testing formal as well as popular definitions with reality. There are many reasons for exposing the reality of prostitution. Nonprostitute women are socialized not to possess sexual information or skill, not to talk about sex, not to ask for money in any situation, and not to associate with whores. A sharing of prostitute financial and sexual practices with nonprostitute women challenges that socialization, challenges the divisions it imposes upon women, and challenges the normative assumption of female sexual and financial dependency.",

      "title": "Normal feline behaviour: … and why problem behaviours develop",
      "abstract": "Practical relevance: Cats are descended from a solitary, territorial ancestor, and while domestication has reduced their inherited tendency to be antagonistic towards all animals larger than their typical prey, they still place more reliance on the security of their territory than on psychological attachments to people or other cats, the exact opposite to dogs. Many feline problem behaviours stem from perceived threats to this security, often due to conflicts with other cats. Others are more developmental in origin, often caused by inadequate exposure to crucial stimuli, especially people, during the socialisation period. Strongly aversive events experienced at any age can also contribute. A third category comprises normal behaviour that owners deem unacceptable, such as scratching of furniture. Evidence base: This review identifies three areas in which basic research is inadequate to support widely employed concepts and practices in feline behavioural medicine. First, classification of cats’ problem behaviours relies heavily on approaches derived from studies of their behavioural ecology and, to some extent, extrapolation from canine studies. Few studies have focused on cats in the home, the environment in which most behavioural disorders are expressed. Secondly, cats’ chemical senses (olfactory and vomeronasal) are far more sensitive than our own, making it difficult for owners or clinicians to fully comprehend the sensory information upon which they base their behaviour. Thirdly, although the concept of psychological distress is widely invoked as an intervening variable in behavioural disorders, there are still no reliable measures of distress for pet cats in the home. Global importance: Psychological distress of some kind is the primary cause of many of the behavioural problems presented to clinicians, but surveys indicate that many more cats display the same clinical signs without their owners ever seeking help. The welfare of this ‘invisible’ group could be improved by veterinarians taking a more proactive approach to educating their clients about the behavioural needs of pet cats.",

Some studies even found no sex differences at all. Many studies comprised gifted/talented subjects. Taking into account the few studies that simultaneously examined the factors 'giftedness' and 'sex' in relation to overexcitability and that yielded conflicting results, our study attempts to clear these heterogeneous findings by investigating a German sample. Our study comprised intellectually gifted (n = 96) and averagely intelligent (n = 91) adults who filled out the 'Overexcitability Questionnaire-Two'. We found no statistically significant interaction of 'giftedness × sex'. Women (regardless of their intellectual status) scored statistically significantly higher than gifted and non-gifted men on emotional as well as sensual overexcitability. With regard to the factor 'giftedness', gifted individuals displayed a statistically significantly higher intellectual overexcitability.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality remains important throughout a person's life, but sexual behavior does not receive the same levels of acceptance at all ages. Older people are challenged by ageist attitudes and perceptions that hinder their sexual expression. They are stereotyped as non-sexual beings who should not, cannot, and do not want to have sexual relationships. Expressing sexuality or engaging in sexual activity in later life is considered by many in society as immoral or perverted. False expectations for older people also stem from ideals of beauty, centralization of the biomedical perspective on sexuality of older adults, and the association of sex with reproduction. Unfortunately, older people internalize many ageist attitudes towards sexuality in later life and become less interested in sex and less sexually active. The following chapter explores attitudes towards sexuality in later life among the media, young people, older people themselves, and care providers. In order to enable older people to express their sexuality and sexual identity freely and fully, awareness of ageist perceptions must be raised and defeated.",

      "abstract": "Ethical controversies in patients with intellectual disability who are sex offenders. Patients with an intellectual disability (ID) have a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains (according to the DSM-5). These deficits in adaptive functioning result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life. Therefore, it is not surprising that these patients cross physical/sexual boundaries quite often. Above that, a proportion of all sex offenders have an intellectual disability. The treatment of these sex offenders with an ID has to focus on protective factors, next to risk factors in order to decrease the risk of recidivism. Due to the chronicity of their disorder, quality of life is an important issue in these patients. In this paper, we want to address some ethical controversies: – hormonal treatment in patients with ID who are sex offenders; – the right to have a ‘normal’ sexual life in these ID offenders, and the Dutch experience of the Stichting Alternatieve Relatiebemiddeling (SAR, that can be translated as foundation of alternative relationship mediation). The SAR is an alternative dating service, giving information about the sexuality of physically or mentally disabled people and organizing sexual encounters for them.

      "abstract": "Koro is the term used to define the fear that one's sex organ is retracting into the body and that the complete retraction of the organ will result in death. While koro is found mainly among the Chinese and other Asian societies near China, the condition is most prevalent in southern China, where repeated epidemics have occurred. In that region, koro is found only among the Hans, the dominant ethnic group, and is over-represented among people under age 24 years. Koro provokes considerable anxiety in the individual in question and his/her family and neighbors, and is more prevalent among males than females. Men try to pull the penis out from the body or to prevent it from shrinking further by tying a string around the penis or securing it with a clamping device. Some Asian women have reported shrinking breasts, nipples, or labia. Relatives and neighbors of the same sex often help to rescue the organ in question, especially in applying anchoring devices. Others may also believe a person has koro and attempt to rescue their organ without the individual's consent. Injury to the sex organ, including bruises, bleeding, and infection, is common and sometimes results in permanent damage. In general, however, koro attacks are acute, brief, and tend not to recur. The 1984-85 koro epidemic in Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula is reviewed to shed light upon prevailing cultural attitudes and beliefs, news and rumors about koro, and anxiety in neighborhoods which may be causative environmental risk factors for koro. Education, age, and marital status are considered as individual risk factors. Koro in China is best described as a social sickness supported by cultural myths which tend to affect young people who are deprived of proper sex information to explain their physical development.",

      "title": "Frailty and Erectile Dysfunction: An Understudied Correlation",
      "abstract": "The area of geriatrics and the study of the aged are gaining prominence all over the world. In the US, the population of people over 65 years old is expected to reach 71 million in 10 years. Men are projected to account for approximately 43% of the population. Owing to their more complex physiological and pathological state, elderly men face many challenges. Erectile function may diminish in elderly and vulnerable people owing to ageing, physical conditions, psychological stress, or a combination of these factors. This propensity is more common in elderly men. This article reviews the literature on frailty syndrome and erectile dysfunction (ED) to better understand them. Complete MEDLINE/PubMed review of non-systematic literature from 1990 to May 2023 was included. This topic is thoroughly researched using “frailty”, “low muscle mass”, “erectile dysfunction”, and “elderly”. Individuals with frailty tend to experience more pronounced instances of ED compared with those who are in good health primarily owing to the anomalies present in their physiological composition. This poses challenges for individuals with physical vulnerabilities to engage in intimate relationships. ED may potentially exert a substantial influence on the mental well-being of older individuals or those who are otherwise vulnerable. Research demonstrates that implementing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can effectively enhance erectile function among elderly individuals. This phenomenon persists despite the knowledge that TRT is not devoid of potential adverse effects. The present investigation has revealed a significant association of frailty, exacerbated by advancing age, with the occurrence of ED. Our findings lead to the conclusion that the condition of frailty becomes more pronounced as individuals advance in age.",

      "abstract": "Although bisexual men report lower levels of mental health relative to gay men, few studies have examined the factors that contribute to bisexual men's mental health. Bisexual men are less likely to disclose, and more likely to conceal (i.e., a desire to hide), their sexual orientation than gay men. Theory suggests that this may adversely impact their mental health. This report examined the factors associated with disclosure and with concealment of sexual orientation, the association of disclosure and concealment with mental health, and the potential mediators (i.e., internalized homophobia, social support) of this association with mental health.An ethnically diverse sample of 203 non-gay-identified, behaviorally bisexual men who do not disclose their same-sex behavior to their female partners were recruited in New York City to complete a single set of self-report measures.Concealment was associated with higher income, a heterosexual identification, living with a wife or girlfriend, more frequent sex with women, and less frequent sex with men. Greater concealment, but not disclosure to friends and family, was significantly associated with lower levels of mental health. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that both internalized homophobia and general emotional support significantly mediated the association between concealment and mental health.The findings demonstrate that concealment and disclosure are independent constructs among bisexual men. Further, they suggest that interventions addressing concerns about concealment, emotional support, and internalized homophobia may be more beneficial for increasing the mental health of bisexual men than those focused on promoting disclosure.",

Rural-urban health disparities may be present among older adults in a number of ways. One common subtype differences by rural-urban status can occur when rural older adults are at a relative health disadvantage compared to urban and suburban older adults. Another common subtype, moderation of other disparities by rural-urban status is when other types of disparities are more pronounced among older adults living in rural areas than those living in urban and suburban areas. That is, where an older adult lives moderates or amplifies existing demographic, social, or economic disparities.",

      "abstract": "Gender dysphoria (GD) is when a person has a strong desire to act differently than their assigned gender, which causes significant distress and dysfunction. Western countries, especially those that legalise the third gender, employ affirmative therapy for people with GD. However, Islam and Malaysian law only recognise gender expression based on natal sex. This further put those with gender dysphoria in Malaysia at risk of developing anxiety, depression, self-harm behavior, and suicide. Apart from that, they are more likely to engage in risky behaviours such as unsafe sex, sex with same-sex, chemsex, substance misuse, drinking alcohol and smoking. This sexual behaviour, especially man sex with man (MSM), contributes to HIV/AIDS, sexual transmitted diseases, and anal cancer. Consequently, it increases the health burden. Thus, this presentation will discuss approaches to dealing with people with this gender dysphoria. There are also ethical dilemmas or conflicts among psychiatrists in giving the diagnosis of gender dysphoria, especially in children and adolescents. Once giving the diagnosis of gender dysphoria, what is the best approach that a Muslim psychiatrist needs to consider? Are we going to practise affirmative therapy or conversion therapy or what? Do Muslim healthcare providers have the right to enforce patients against their will? Still, this would make it harder for people to get help and make them less likely to go to healthcare providers, especially Muslims. In contrast, this will encourage people with GD to go to healthcare providers that can support or affirm their desire, which is against Islamic and Malaysian law. Muslim healthcare providers should take the opportunity to help people with GD manage their conflicts according to the Islamic way.

      "title": "Determinants of individual fertility and contraceptive use: a review and synthesis of the literature.",
      "abstract": "This discussion, which reviews the fertility determinants literature from a sociopsychological or individual perspective, summarizes literature addressing the determinants of individual fertility, i.e., an individual's decision to use or not use an effective contraceptive method. Complete or definite answers about fertility determinants do not exist, but enough is known to provide an overview. From the 259 articles, monographs, and books examined and classified, 6 main classes of determinants were formed and analyzed: demographic; sociopsychological; experiential or behavioral; informational, including knowledge about reproduction and birth control; husband and wife interaction; and environmental. Gaps in the existing literature about these determinants are identified and a sociopsychological model integrating existing knowledge is proposed. In general, the following groups of individuals have relatively high fertility and/or relatively low or ineffective contraceptive use: low socioeconomic status, adolescents and people aged 40 and older, Catholics and highly religious, rural, many siblings, unemployed women or working women who do not attach great importance to their careers; and ethnic minorities. Sociopsychological determinants of fertility and contraceptive use have been classified into 2 groups: personality traits and values and attitudes. In general, the evidence linking values and attitudes to fertility-related behavior is stronger than personality traits, but some promising work in the personality area is being conducted. In general an early age at 1st marriage related to higher fertility, and duration of marriage positively associated with fertility as is a younger age at 1st birth. In general, there is a positive correlation between contraceptive knowledge and contraceptive behavior. Certain aspects of the husband/wife relationship, including the allocation of roles and responsibilities between husband and wife and the scope and frequency of their communication--are related to their fertility and contraceptive use. The extent to which family planning programs contribute to fertility decline, over and above the effects due to modernization and development, remains unanswered empirically. The following gaps in the literature were observed: the need for more research on the role of the male partner in determining fertility and contraceptive use, the experiential or behavioral determinants of fertility and contraceptive use, employment history, environmental aspects, and integration of the area into theoretical framework(s) capable of empirical verification.",

      "title": "6. Risk-taking, antisocial behaviour, and delinquency",
      "abstract": "Abstract 'Risk-taking, antisocial behaviour, and delinquency' considers the incidence of risky behaviour, gender differences, and historical changes. Males are more likely to exhibit risky behaviour than females. Although minor or infrequent antisocial acts may be frequent in adolescence, not all adolescents get involved, and many do not get involved a lot. The most powerful predictors from middle childhood to chronic delinquency in adolescence are: troublesomeness in school; hyperactivity/poor concentration; low intelligence and poor attainment; family criminality; family poverty; and poor parenting. Social control theory argues that antisocial behaviour is less likely when the young person has a stake in social institutions such as the family, school, or clubs and societies.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Conceptions among 6‐7 year old children of behaviour appropriate to the sexes were studied using a modification of Hudson's (1968) questionnaire. The views of adults were obtained for comparison. The children tended to see more activities as suitable for one sex only than did adults. Boys and men tended to see sex roles as more differentiated than did the girls and women respectively. ‘Doing car repairs’, ‘doing woodwork’ and ‘enjoying war films’ all emerged near the top of the list for ‘men only’ whether it was boys, girls, men or women giving their views. For ‘women only’, ‘mending clothes’, ‘wearing jewelry’, ‘being a ballet dancer’ and ‘talking about clothes’ came near the top in all cases. It is suggested that, for whatever reason, it has become part of the cultural fabric that men and women should do different things, and that a young child acquires a stereotyped and exaggerated view of what is appropriate for the sexes.",

      "abstract": "Romantic love is a psychobehavioral motivational state that facilitates pair-bonding in humans. Evolutionarily, it is thought to help establish and maintain long-term pair-bonds that enhance a heterosexual couple’s reproductive fitness. Romantic love can also occur in same-sex partnerships, yet not much is known, either psychologically or behaviorally, about the similarities or differences in how romantic love manifests in homosexual or bisexual couples compared with heterosexual couples. This study investigated romantic love in a cross-cultural sample of heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual young adults (N = 783) experiencing romantic love. We analyzed differences between sexual orientation groups on six variables pertaining to different aspects of romantic love. These variables included number of times ever in love; the timing of falling in love relative to starting a romantic relationship; intensity of romantic love; obsessive thinking about a loved one; commitment; and frequency of sex per week. Homosexual females reported a significantly lower frequency of sex per week than heterosexual and bisexual females. Bisexual males reported a greater number of times ever in love than heterosexual males. Other variables revealed small or very small differences between sexual orientation groups. This study provides initial findings indicating that romantic love manifests in somewhat different ways across sexual orientation groups.",

      "abstract": "Endocrine disruptors (EDs) or simply endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to any substance which may mimic or interfere with the normal functions of the endocrine system. They are found in everyday products like plastic bottles and containers, liners of metal food cans, detergents, flame retardants, food, toys, cosmetics, pesticides, and virtually every available human consumables. Due to the fact that most of them are slow in degradation or even completely non- biodegradable, they constitute great risk to the ecosystem. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this current review therefore is to identify and peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDCs on adult male and female fertility during the critical preconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. Finally, it will highlight future research focus as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity.",

Against this background of long periods of silence or inattentiveness and a kind of mute approval on the part of society, there emerges from time to time a science or technology area with a high level of salience and the potential for controversy. The picture on those infrequent occasions is one in which general attitudes toward science with a clearly positive sign, or valence, commingle with critical perceptions (ranging from reservations to active opposition by way of ambivalence) toward new scientifi c or technological developments.",

      "abstract": "The human tendency to impose costs on those who have behaved antisocially towards third parties (third-party punishment) has a formative influence on societies, yet very few studies of the development of this tendency exist. In most studies where young children have punished, participants have imposed costs on puppets, leaving open the question as to whether young children punish in real third-party situations. Here, five-year-olds were given the opportunity to allocate desirable or unpleasant items to antisocial and neutral adults, who were presented as real and shown on video. Neutral individuals were almost always allocated only desirable items. Antisocial individuals were instead usually allocated unpleasant items, as long as participants were told they would give anonymously. Most participants who were instead told they would give in person did not allocate unpleasant items, although a minority did so. This indicates that the children interpreted the situation as real, and that whereas they genuinely desired to punish antisocial adults, they did not usually dare do so in person. Boys punished more frequently than girls. The willingness of preschoolers to spontaneously engage in third-party punishment, occasionally even risking the social costs of antagonizing an anti-social adult, demonstrates a deep-seated early-developing punitive sentiment in humans.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gaze is an emergent visual feature. A person's gaze direction is perceived not just based on the rotation of their eyes, but also their head. At least among adults, this integrative process appears to be flexible such that one feature can be weighted more heavily than the other depending on the circumstances. Yet it is unclear how this weighting might vary across individuals or across development. When children engage emergent gaze, do they prioritize cues from the head and eyes similarly to adults? Is the perception of gaze among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emergent, or is it reliant on a single feature? Sixty adults ( M = 29.86 years‐of‐age), thirty‐seven typically developing children and adolescents ( M = 9.3 years‐of‐age; range = 7–15), and eighteen children with ASD ( M = 9.72 years‐of‐age; range = 7–15) viewed faces with leftward, rightward, or direct head rotations in conjunction with leftward or rightward pupil rotations, and then indicated whether the face was looking leftward or rightward. All individuals, across development and ASD status, used head rotation to infer gaze direction, albeit with some individual differences. However, the use of pupil rotation was heavily dependent on age. Finally, children with ASD used pupil rotation significantly less than typically developing (TD) children when inferring gaze direction, even after accounting for age. Our approach provides a novel framework for understanding individual and group differences in gaze as it is actually perceived—as an emergent feature. Furthermore, this study begins to address an important gap in ASD literature, taking the first look at emergent gaze perception in this population.",

      "abstract": "Addictive disorders are characterized by a decrease in functionality, leading to significant disruptions in daily life, due to the excessive use of certain substances or behaviors that initially induce pleasure, but ultimately result in a loss of control. There are sex/gender differences in the pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, and treatment of addictive disorders, since these disorders are caused by an interplay of biological and socio-environmental factors. It is crucial to take these differences into account in both research and clinical practice. From a neurobiological perspective, women may exhibit a faster progression toward addictive disorders, due to their reward circuit's heightened sensitivity when exposed to addictive substances. Additionally, they may be more prone to relapse because of their increased sensitivity to stress and withdrawal symptoms. The prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders is higher in men, but in Korea that belongs to Asia, alcohol use disorder is now more common among women in their 30s than among men of the same age group, reflecting an increase in prevalence among women over the last 10 years. Gaming disorders are more prevalent among men, while social media overuse is higher among women, who have a stronger emotional and interpersonal orientation than men. In treating addictive disorders, it is necessary to implement specialized programs for women. However, these programs should not perpetuate bias, while given the rising number of women with addictive disorders, we need strategies to improve their access to these programs.",

Para realizacao da pesquisa, foram aplicados tres questionarios aos voluntarios que se enquadraram nos criterios de inclusao: ficha de entrevista que caracterizou a amostra estudada; Questionario do Complexo de Adonis – QCA e Conjunto de silhuetas para identificacao da prevalencia de DM e de disturbios ligados a IC. Os resultados destacados mostraram que 75% dos homens e o mesmo percentual de mulheres (75%) alegaram estar satisfeitos com sua aparencia, e o restante (25% para homens e mulheres) demonstraram insatisfacao quanto a sua IC. A silhueta que melhor representou sua aparencia atual, foram as silhuetas que caracteriza a hipertrofia I (46,4%), seguido de magreza (32,1%). Porem, quando se tratou da silhueta que gostariam de ter, 46,4% dos participantes marcaram as imagens que se enquadravam na hipertrofia II, seguido da hipertrofia I (39,3%). Quanto a percepcao dos outros quanto a sua IC, 36% afirmaram ser as silhuetas que corresponde a magreza, seguido de hipertrofia I (34%). Na classificacao dos escores verificou-se que a maioria dos participantes foram classificados nos escores de leve a moderado (46,4% e 50% respectivamente). Quando comparado a classificacao dos escores quanto ao genero, percebeu-se que os homens (50% - leve e 50% - moderado) e a maioria das mulheres (42,9% - leve e 50% - moderado) foram enquadrados tambem nesses escores. No escore classificado como grave, sendo o Complexo de Adonis provavelmente um problema serio para os entrevistados, somente as mulheres integraram essa classificacao (7,1%). Nenhum integrante se enquadrou na categoria gravissimo. Os resultados demonstram que apesar da existencia de varias pesquisas voltadas a essa tematica, a investigacao de DM entre mulheres ainda e escassa, tornando estudos comparativos como esses indispensaveis, assim como outros que possam analisar uma melhor forma de identificacao, prevencao e tratamento multidisciplinar da vigorexia.",

Not only is this developmental period the longest, but also the most advanced in terms of maturity of mental and biological structures people achieve. Therefore, adulthood quite naturally forms an arena for creative activities and achievements. However, creativity in adulthood does not only (or even not mainly) refer to test-measured creative potential; rather, it denotes expertise-based, mature, and in some rare cases, eminent creativity. What are the milestones of creative development in adulthood? Why is it that so many people do not reach the level of mature creativity? What makes adults realize, or not, their creative potential, and invest their time and effort to develop it? We discuss these questions and show some new avenues for future research.",

The implications of these differences are examined in a sample of 150 community-dwelling white men and women. The majority are women, a high proportion of whom are unmarried, living alone, functionally impaired, and have reduced financial resources. Men, in contrast, have fewer decrements, they are more independent, and they exercise more control over their environment. However, their well-being may be undermined by some unanticipated events such as widowhood, caregiving, and relocation. Case examples illustrate how the timing of life course events differs among men and women and results in differences in the problems they face in late-late life.",

People with gender identity disorder may act and present themselves as members of the opposite sex and may express a desire to alter their bodies. The disorder affects an individual's self-image, and can impact the person's mannerisms and behavior.\r\nAs gender identity develops in children, with sex-role assignment. Sex role-stereotypes are the beliefs, characteristics and behaviors of individual cultures that are considered normal and appropriate for boys and girls to possess. These norms are influenced by ones family and friends, the mass-media, and their community. Since many cultures strongly disapprove of cross-gender behavior, it often results in significant problems for affected persons and those in close relationships with them. In many cases, discomfort is also reported as stemming from the feeling that one's body is wrong or meant to be different.\r\nThe need for treatment is emphasized by the high rate of mental health problems, including Depression with higher suicide rate among untreated transsexual people than in the general population.\r\nThese problems are not usually related to the gender identity issues themselves, but the social and cultural responses to gender-deviated individuals.\r\nAn example which classically illustrates GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER is the case of a young man from Brunei Darussalam, who was seen and treated.

      "title": "Analisi delle problematiche degli handicappati in ambiente domestico: la cucina verifica e progetto",
      "abstract": "Nella stesura di questa tesi, si sono utilizzati i termini menomazione, disabilita ed handicap considerando la definizione fornita dall'Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanita.\r\n Menomazione: Qualsiasi perdita o anormalita a carico di una struttura o di una funzione psicologica, fisiologica o anatomica.\r\n Disabilita: qualsiasi limitazione o perdita (conseguente a menomazione) della capacita di compiere un'attivita nel modo o nell'ampiezza considerati normali un essere umano.\r\n Handicap: condizione di svantaggio conseguente a una menomazione o a una disabilita che in un certo soggetto limita o impedisce l'adempimento dei ruolo normale in relazione all'eta, sesso e fattori socio\r\n culturali.\r\n Facendo riferimento alla definizione di Handicap come condizione di svantaggio, bisogna sottolineare come gli oggetti e l'ambiente stesso che ci circonda, tramite una pessima o ottima progettazione, possano peggiorare o migliorare le condizioni di vita delle persone, indipendentemente dalla foro condizione fisica. E' infatti dovuta ai fattori socio\r\n culturali non propriamente positivi la presenza della maggior parte delle barriere che oggi impediscono la completa godibilita dell'ambiente (domestico e non) alla totalita delle persone.\r\n Chiaramente, il problema e di maturazione culturale, di avere la sensibilita non solo all'inserimento sociale dell' handicappato, ma anche di essere consapevoli dei diritto di questi a non subire discriminazioni legate al proprio stato. Nell'anno 2000 non e purtroppo difficile trovare sui quotidiani casi di intolleranza o di insofferenza verso queste persone: casi in cui, ad esempio, la persona handicappata, a causa dei parere contrario dei condominio, non riesce ad ottenere (od ottiene con grandi difficolta) l'installazione di un ascensore o di un servoscala, poiche rovinerebbe l'immagine, oppure casi di albergatori che non riescono a far occupare dalle persone senza disabilita fisiche le camere con bagni accessibili a tutti. Le stesse aziende produttrici fanno molta attenzione al modo in cui proporre prodotti accessibili a tutti paura di farli ricadere nella sottofascia per handicappati.\r\n E' pero altrettanto doveroso sottolineare come il diritto di fruire completamente dei luoghi e dei contesto in cui si vive, e espressamente previsto dall'ART. 3 della Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana, che recita: Tutti i cittadini hanno pari dignita sociale e sono eguali davanti alla legge, senza distinzioni di sesso, di razza, di lingua, di religione, di opinioni politiche, di condizioni personali e sociali.\r\n E' compito della repubblica rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e sociale, che limitando di fatto le liberta e l'eguaglianza dei cittadini, impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana e l'effettiva partecipazione di tutti i lavoratori all'organizzazione politica, economica e sociale dei Paese. \r\n E' stata ritenuta utile una tesi di laurea su questo tema dopo aver riscontrato le grandi difficolta che i disabili devono superare nell'ambiente abitativo, sia quanto riguarda l'autonomia, sia la qualita della vita, in cui tutto e pensato unicamente con criteri ergonomici utenti non disabili.\r\n Gli ambienti domestici in cui si verificano le maggiori difficolta sono la cucina e il bagno. E' stato analizzato l'ambiente della cucina perche il bagno esistono diverse soluzioni progettuali.\r\n La tesi e stata sviluppata in due parti, una parte di ricerca, che ha fornito il sistema\r\n delle prestazioni richieste ed una di progetto, che ha soddisfatto le prestazioni\r\n richieste che si ritenevano prioritarie.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni richieste: sono state analizzate le esigenze emerse\r\n dall'intero sistema d'utenza e sono state illustrate tramite una sezione esplicativa\r\n accompagnata da degli elaborati grafici. In dettaglio:\r\n -Le complessita relative ai diversi tipi di utenza: l'utenza d'uso, di produzione, di\r\n gestione e sociale\r\n -Gli ausili necessari agli utenti disabili la deambulazione\r\n -I dati antropometrici degli utenti d'uso\r\n -Le tipologie ambientali ricorrenti in cucina\r\n -Le attrezzature indispensabili in cucina\r\n -Il lavoro che in cucina e necessario compiere durante la preparazione dei pasti.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite: il progetto\r\n -Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite si e tradotto, tramite alcuni elaborati grafici, in\r\n un prodotto di produzione industriale:\r\n una postazione che permette la preparazione dei cibi e il lavaggio delle\r\n stoviglie, con caratteristiche di flessibilita di installazione e di componenti,\r\n che permette l'utilizzo sia ad utenti disabili che ad utenti con mobilita non\r\n compromessa.\r\n Sulla base dei risultati della ricerca delle prestazioni richieste, eseguita nell'anno\r\n 1999, e stato sviluppato un progetto preliminare, costituito da elaborati grafici e\r\n tridimensionali che rappresentavano i vincoli e le prestazioni a cui il progetto doveva\r\n rispondere. Nel mese di gennaio 2000 e stato proposto a FRANKE S.p.A., nella\r\n persona dei Dott. Zeno Fontana, una collaborazione nello sviluppo industriale del\r\n progetto preliminare, che ha avuto la durata di circa un anno (gennaio- dicembre 2000) e che ha portato alla realizzazione di un prototipo ligneo in scala 1:1.",

Affected patients need a comprehensive assessment that includes taking a sexual history, medical evaluation and, if appropriate, a manual examination in order to diagnose, treat or identify factors relevant for each individual woman. There may be biological, psychological, emotional and relationship issues. Any biological factors such as vaginal dryness, pelvic floor dysfunction or chronic pain need to be addressed first to help prevent more complex problems developing. Sexual problems may be the cause of or the result of dysfunctional or unsatisfactory relationships. Psychological and emotional factors can create difficulties in sexual response and, equally, they can be the result of unaddressed or untreated biological/medical issues. Nurses working in urology need to be aware of the physiology involved in sexual response and know which conditions and illnesses are likely to affect sexual functioning and which treatments can help.",

We are now a long way from the Victorian, moralistic, judgemental view that masturbation must not take place because it is wrong. Temporary feelings of guilt are a normal reaction to masturbation; it is when this guilt seriously interferes with the person's whole life that we should take it as a 'danger sign'. Most male adolescents are normally more open about this activity and about some of the fears or worries accompanying it. Some female adolescents deal with it in a different way from males, and it is not unusual for girls not to have the conscious wish to masturbate at all. For a girl, this could be quite a normal reaction, whereas in the case of a boy we would see such a reaction as much more related to 'danger signs' either now or at some time in the future.",

Sur ces quatre affirmations repose le discours sur l’hypersexualisation. Elles sont examinées ici à la lumière des données disponibles sur le sujet. En fait, les données publiées sur les conduites sexuelles des jeunes Québécois et Canadiens ne permettent pas de conclure à une diminution de l’âge du premier rapport sexuel dans la dernière décennie (que ce soit pour le sexe oral, vaginal ou anal), ni à une exacerbation des activités sexuelles, ni à un déclin de la morale et des valeurs sexuelles. Par ailleurs, les données disponibles appuient partiellement l’hypothèse voulant que les adolescents soient exposés de façon grandissante à des contenus plus explicitement sexuels dans les médias traditionnels (télévision, magazines), et l’accès plus facile et plus fréquent à de tels contenus se confirme sur Internet.",

      "title": "Adolescent and Youths Sexually Transmitted Infections: Current Trends and Interesting Associated Factors",
      "abstract": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have emerged as a significant public health concern in our country. The incidence of STIs among adolescents and youths has been steadily increasing, primarily due to engaging in unprotectedsexual activities. In order to effectively address and mitigate these issues, it is crucial to comprehend the various factors associated with risky sexual behaviors among adolescents and youths. Factors such as adolescent growth and development, cognitive and brain development during this phase, history of adverse childhood events, sleep problems, family background, and the influence of society play roles in shaping their sexual behaviors. In today's digital society, individuals have easy access to social media, applications, and various sources of information related to sexual issues. These can include pornography videos, dating applications, cybersex, substances, chemsex, and more. As the secular trend in puberty continues, with adolescents experiencing an earlier onset of sexual maturation, several factors contribute to an increase risk of sexual behavior among these age groups. The decrease in quality family time, limitations in the monitoring system, and the emergence of imitating behaviors among adolescents and youths, all play a role in exacerbating this risk. In this article, authors review situation of STIs among adolescents and youths, factors related with sexual risk behaviors among adolescents and youths, and upcoming trends of risky behaviors contributing to have STIs among adolescents and youths, based on current evidence base.",

Du calendrier aux attitudes La description du premier rapport sexuel fournit aussi un point de vue sur l'ensemble de l'activité sexuelle des individus. Cette étape ne se déroule plus aujourd'hui comme il y a cinquante ans. Ainsi l'âge moyen des femmes au premier rapport s'est abaissé de plus de 3 ans en un demi-siècle. Pourtant les différences entre hommes et femmes ne se sont pas effacées au fil des générations. Pour les hommes, cet événement reste un moment d'apprentissage sexuel, alors que pour les femmes, il indique une première relation pré-conjugale ou conjugale. Dans chaque génération, certains individus connaissent une entrée précoce dans la vie sexuelle, et d'autres une entrée tardive. Une entrée tardive dans la sexualité est liée à certains facteurs qui retardent la maturation sociale, comme par exemple le fait de mener des études longues. Mais un âge précoce ou tardif au premier rapport signale aussi une attitude à l'égard de la sexualité, et plus largement à l'égard du couple, voire de la vie familiale. Les individus les plus précoces sexuellement ont une vie plus complexe que les autres : ce sont eux qui ont le plus de séparations, et qui par ailleurs ont le répertoire de pratiques sexuelles le plus diversifié. Ceux qui sont entrés tardivement dans la vie sexuelle ont un profil plus traditionnel : ils ont beaucoup moins de partenaires et restent plus souvent avec le même conjoint. Ils se refusent à séparer couple, sexualité et sentiment. Ces différences d'attitude et de comportement sont très marquées chez les hommes. Elles ressortent beaucoup moins nettement chez les femmes, surtout dans les générations anciennes ; les femmes tendent toujours à associer systématiquement sexualité et sentiment.",

Extreme favoritism appears to require one or more of these four factors for its development: (a) at least one parent experienced emotional trauma in his/her childhood, (b) the child's conception or birth was unusual or stressful, (c) a child's appearance or actions are invested with “good” or “bad” meanings, and (d) there is severe marital conflict, accompanied by the inability of the family to provide corrections to the “good/bad” identities assigned to children. Favorites are exposed not only to the love of a favoring parent but also to that parent's weaknesses and to the other family members' dislike. The favorite is usually guaranteed the lasting dislike of his brothers and sisters. To be a favorite is indeed a mixed blessing.",

      "title": "Sexual Stimuli Cause Behavioral Disinhibition in Both Men and Women, but Even More So in Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract In our society men are considered more impulsive than women, especially in the violent and sexual domain. This correlation of sex and impulsivity might trace back to enhanced male impulsivity in general or a domain specific effect of emotions on impulsivity. The evidence for sex differences in the interaction of emotional or sexual stimuli and impulsivity has been relatively inconclusive so far. In this study, we investigated the effects of various emotional stimuli on responsivity in a Go/No-Go task. Participants had to respond quickly to a visual cue and withhold their response to another visual cue, while different emotional pictures were presented in the background, including sexual stimuli, non-sexual positive stimuli and negative stimuli. Both men ( N = 37) and women ( N = 38) made most commission errors in the sexual condition, indicating a disinhibiting effect in both genders. On top of this, men made even more commission errors than women, specifically in the sexual condition and not in other conditions. Men rated sexual stimuli as more positive, but did not differ from women in arousal ratings and pupil dilation. These findings may partly indicate increased impulsive behavior under sexual arousal in men, most likely driven by enhanced approach motivation due to more positive value but not higher arousal of sexual stimuli. The results are consistent with the theory of evolutionarily based concealment of sexual interest in women.",

      "title": "Keyhole Testimony: Witnessing Sodomy in the Eighteenth Century",
      "abstract": "Shop-keepers some there wereAnd men of good repute,Each vow'd a Bachelor,Unnat'ral Lust pursu'dThe Women Hater's Lamentation (1707)1Much of what was written about sodomy during the eighteenth century remains amazingly vague. With a few crucial exceptions, broadsides and fictional accounts describe sodomy in very general terms, not as a transgressive sexual practice that involves certain unspeakable activities, but rather as a set of specific habits of dress or personal hygiene, often a foreign accent or questionable religious leanings, and occasionally a taste for opera.2 Even the socalled trial accounts themselves most often talk around sodomy, explaining for instance that men in the molly house were making love or that one man was caught in the act of seducing another-with a hand in his breeches, for instance-without any corroborating evidence or actual physical description of sodomitical relations.3At signal, rare moments, however, descriptions of sodomy include a visual account putatively based on observation that offers readers a titillating insight into the dynamics of unnatural activity. In the trial of Thomas Rodin (October 1722), for instance, Henry clay ton tells the court:I and the Prisoner lodg'd in one Room, at Peter Wright's, a Shoemaker, at the Three Shoes next Door to the Harrow in Long-Alley in Moorfields. My Landlady keeps a Baudy-house, and lets out Lodgings. Some Time in March last,-I forget the Day,-there accidentally comes in a Stranger to lodge, the Prisoner drank with him, and at half an Hour past ten they went up to Bed together; and saw the Prisoner lying with him in the Nature of carnal Copulation, as a Man lies with a Woman.Court. How you be sure of that.Clayton. not put my Hand between them; but it was a Moon-light Night, and was abed in the same room, and see what they plain enough.4Henry Clayton's account depends on direct visual testimony: clayton sees two men in the act of copulation. As unimaginative as his description is, it does suggest some of the ways in which sodomy is already coded. The visual account is enhanced by the moonlight and the intimacy of the observer, and even these simple details work to create a scene. Moreover, clayton's tantalizing claim that he did not put my Hand between (misprinted as I put my hand between in a recent edition of these trials) serves to emphasize his physical proximity and to give credence to his observation, which concludes with the claim that he could see what they plain enough (my emphasis). But clayton's account also demonstrates the perils of such close observation:5Court. How long was it before you spoke of this?Clayton. spoke on't the next Day.Court. And why you not prosecute sooner?Clayton is very quickly on the defensive here, and before very long his testimony has been thoroughly discredited. This is in part because his own character has been rendered questionable, not because of any activity of his own but because of his intimacy with the scene of sodomy itself. Sodomy is dangerously seductive, as this moonlit scene suggests.6 Clayton can hardly keep his hands away from the copulating couple.For the obvious reason that proximity implies guilty association, then, such accounts are often framed as keyhole testimony, in which an observer watches certain sexual activities from a distance and then reports them to a listener or an audience, either in a court of law or another social situation, such as an antisodomy tract or a novel. Rather than get so close that the observer touch the participants, in other words, a doorway or a partition usually separates the observer from the scene of sodomy. This gives precedence to a visual account of the scene and offers a new set of erotic dynamics, as the following account suggests.In the trial record for John Dicks (April 1722), for instance, the following testimony is recorded:William Rogers. …",

      "abstract": "Social scientists know little about the effect of religion and abstinence pledging on premarital sex beyond adolescence. Evidence from a sample of married young adults in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( N = 2,079) reveals that premarital sex is widespread even among religious Americans and abstinence pledgers. Nevertheless, these individuals are much more likely than their counterparts to avoid premarital sex entirely. When they do have premarital sex, pledgers are more likely to restrict the behavior to their future spouse. Though contextual, exposure, and social control effects explain some of the influence of religion and abstinence pledging, religion and abstinence pledging appear to exert robust, direct effects on premarital sexual behavior.",

Durante la gestacion de los animales esta relacion produce anormalidades fetales y defectos posnatales conductuales, ya que parece disminuir la circulacion uteroplacentaria fetal. El impacto auditivo posnatal afecta el eje hipotalamo-hipofisiario y el sistema autonomico vegetativo, de lo cual resultan los signos sistemicos del estres. Los efectos conductuales, como la afectacion en la ingestion de comida y agua, y las convulsiones audiogenicas, son debidos al estres. Los efectos senalados en los seres humanos son iguales a los encontrados en los animales, pero las diferentes personalidades, el significado subjetivo y la patologia individual subyacente modifican la respuesta. Los efectos persisten en una intensidad igual a la inicial aun despues de cesar el estimulo, por lo que pudiera no haber habituacion tras la exposicion cronica. En los individuos que trabajan bajo condiciones ruidosas aparece una gran variedad de trastornos. Los estudios de poblaciones expuestas al ruido reportan un incremento en la morbimortalidad. Por ello, la relacion que hay entre el ruido y los trastornos mentales parece deberse al ruido intenso. El ruido tambien puede influir para que se presente el cancer, o acelerar su desarrollo por via teratogenica. El estres auditivo puede inducir conductas que propicien el consumo de tabaco, alcohol y otras sustancias quimicas, asi como aumentar las posibilidades de riesgo y propension a multiples enfermedades.",

      "abstract": "Environments erode health by shaping biologically based goal systems, or adaptive strivings, that help a brain regulate bodily energy resources. Adaptive strivings let predictive brain processes anticipate and meet even modest shifts in impending metabolic demands. Adaptive strivings serve growth, social potency, and safety. Striving for personal and social growth (transcendence striving) improves energy regulation and promotes health. But adverse environments can foster precarious strivings that cause organic damage even in the absence of fight-flight responses or distressing emotions: Agonistic striving (persistently seeking to influence others) and dissipated striving (disengaging to be safe) impair regulation and foster illness by generating perpetual power contests or perceptions of self-inefficacy. Threats to social power or status endanger health by inducing precarious strivings that amplify adversities. Emotional transcendence striving, however, may dampen harsh health impacts. Research has replicated the three strivings across differences of race, sex, and age and indicates that agonistic striving contributes to hypertension, somatic symptoms, and alcohol use disorders. Harmful health effects of agonistic striving are moderated by emotional transcendence striving indexed by the ability to modulate anger or physical pain. Agonistic striving mediates the association between exposure to neighborhood disorder and hypertension after controlling for negative emotions and disease-prone traits.",

Because of the importance attached to sexual competence, the physician's efforts to improve the quality of a patient's life through prevention, treatment, or referral are worthwhile. Principles of therapy for psychiatric aspects of male sexual dysfunction tend to be simple and easily applied. Therapy is most effective when both partners are treated together. The physician stresses learning and encourages the couple to focus on pleasure rather than on performance.

      "abstract": "Normative masculinity and alexithymia may negatively affect sexual life and men’s well-being. In this study, the endorsement of traditional male norms, alexithymia and sexual behavior were assessed through an online survey directed to Brazilian men. Relationship status and religion were also addressed, and associations and correlations between variables were carried out. The survey presented 66 items, including standardized questionnaires, such as Meanings of Adolescent Masculinity Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale and Male Sexual Quotient. The sample consisted in 528 Brazilian men with high socioeconomic and educational levels. Alexithymia was negatively correlated with sexual satisfaction. The endorsement of traditional male norms was positively correlated with pornography use and was also associated with sharing of pornographic material through social media. Married men had the lowest levels of alexithymia, with significant difference when compared with men who are not currently in a relationship. Furthermore, having a religion was associated with greater endorsement of traditional male norms. These findings suggest that alexithymia may have greater influence on behaviors associated with interpersonal relations, including sexual satisfaction and relationship status. Conversely, normative masculinity was linked to personal variables, which did not involve a partner, including pornography consumption and religion. &#x0D;",

Men, who at age 12 endorsed interests and undesirable traits more typically associated with women, had poorer social-personal adjustment at ages 31 and 41. No effects were found for women. Feminine expressive traits at age 31 did not impact on 41-year-old adjustment for either men or women, whereas masculine instrumental traits were positively related for both.

Literature on sexuality and later life often point to the obfuscation of older people’s sexuality and how the neglect of sexuality in later life (in research and elsewhere) render older asexual. A shift in discourse can however be identified in which older people’s sexuality, from being an unthinkable issue, increasingly is regarded as lifelong and part of a healthy and positive ageing. What the article on Sven Tumba conveys is, however, how sexuality is by and large equated with erection and heterosexual penetrative sex, something which is in line with how discourses of lifelong and healthy ageing are often constructed. Impotence is posited as the major threat to continued sexual activity in later life, and sexuality is hence conceptualised in a narrow way and largely rooted in male experience.",

Also, research has shown that microaggressions can hurt people from underrepresented groups, like people of colour and women, more than others, which can worsen workplace inequality. They can also contribute to a hostile and unwelcoming work environment that makes employees less productive, more likely to miss work, and less happy. Microaggressions can be done on purpose or by accident.

      "abstract": "Abstract Throughout the reproductive years, from around age 13 to about 5o, the menstrual cycle provides continual, mainly positive, changes in the internal environment of women. This cycle of change is an integral and influential part of normal existence. Knowledge of the reproductive cycle and of its effects is essential to a full understanding of women. This paper describes each phase of the cycle in terms of broad psychological and physiological changes. Although personal and social events will clearly affect each woman's experience, it is clear that a background climate is set by the cycle which predisposes towards certain feelings and behaviour.With information and advice, not only can there be great benefit from the whole menstrual cycle, but any distress in the premenstrual days can be alleviated. More serious menstrual disorder should be appropriately investigated, preferably with continued counselling support.The counsellor must first discover whether any menstrual disorder is a central problem, or possibly an exacerbating factor. Occasionally the cycle is made a focus for problems which have a quite different basis. In all cases the counsellor can help women to turn to good account a biological cycle which is predominantly favourable.",

      "title": "Psychological Ownership",
      "abstract": "Experiencing \"psychological ownership\" refers to the state when people feel that they possess ownership stake in an object, be it material or immaterial. In the family business context, such ownership experience can be developed even by non-owners such as nonfamily employees and managers or family members who have not (yet) received financial stake in the business. It has been shown that psychological ownership is linked to a set of attitudes and behaviours that can be beneficial or detrimental to the family firm. Among them are increased levels of commitment, engagement, loyalty and other steward-like behaviours. On the downside, however, are territoriality behaviours, hindrance of cooperation and the inability to share power and letting go. Furthermore, recent research has extended psychological ownership from an individual to a group level.",

      "abstract": "A group of 25 schizoid patients were compared with 76 neurotic patients and 103 healthy persons in terms of perceived parent imago and family dynamics. The following findings should be emphasized: 1. Schizoid persons can be distinguished well from other persons on the basis of their experience of family. 2. A clear delimitation of schizoid persons from neurotic persons is possible only when the factor of sex is considered. 3. Schizoid women differ from neurotic women in terms of their distinctive mother experience: The mothers of schizoid women are marked by a weak ego and are apprehensive and extremely permissive. 4. Schizoid men differ from neurotic men both in terms of a distinctive mother experience and a distinctive father experience. In their case, a negative mother imago is contrasted with an ambivalent father imago. Neurotic men, on the other hand, possess a mother imago nearly as positive as that of healthy men, although they do exhibit a distinctly more negative father imago. 5. Schizoid women differ from schizoid men in terms of a distinctively negative mother imago. Whereas the mothers of schizoid women are experienced above all as exhibiting a weak ego and traits of dependency, the mothers of schizoid men are perceived more as being strong and independent.",

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

However, creativity in adulthood does not only (or even not mainly) refer to test-measured creative potential; rather, it denotes expertise-based, mature, and, in some rare cases, eminent creativity. What are the milestones of creative development in adulthood? Why is it that so many people do not reach the level of mature creativity? What makes adults realize, or not, their creative potential, and invest their time and effort to develop it? We discuss these questions and show some new avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "Sex is genetically inherited, but the child s participation in a particular social and cultural group must be built. Previous studies suggest that between 16 and 24 months old the child already has notions of gender identity, being able to categorize objects culturally appropriate to males and females. This research investigates the manifestations of gender identity in children between 21 and 30 months of age under the influence of the company of another child of the same sex or opposite sex. This study proposed to verify two hypotheses. The first is that children are influenced by the sex of their child partner selecting and manipulating objects. The second is that if this mentioned gender reference exists between boys and girls, the manifestation of imitative behavior will be influenced by the gender of the child partner. 12 children between 21 and 30 months old participated in the experiment, six boys and six girls, medium to high social-economic level. Dyads were formed using children of the same gender and children of mixed gender. The procedure consisted of placing the dyads of children in the presence of toys, some of them suitable for boys and other suitable for girls, and watch their choices and imitations. Each child dyad was videotaped during 20 minutes in the presence of objects considered appropriate for males and females. The following were analyzed: objects chosen by children, imitative behavior and time of manipulation of objects. The study showed that childs choices and objects manipulations were influenced by their partners. In dyads exclusively male prevail the manipulation of objects appropriate to the male gender, and in exclusively female dyads prevail the manipulation of objects appropriate to the female gender. However the frequency of choice and manipulation of female objects by male children increased in mixed dyads. With respect to imitation, the boys showed a greater tendency to imitate the girls than girls to imitate the boys%%%%O sexo e herdado geneticamente, mas a participacao da crianca em um determinado grupo social e cultural deve ser construida.

The self‐induced asphyxia may be either chemical or mechanical, and its purpose it to heighten the sexual pleasure. The practice of sexual asphyxia can result in death; however, many such deaths may erroneously be viewed as suicides or homicides as a result of the lack of knowledge of the practice. Sixteen sexual asphyxiai deaths, reported in Dade County (Miami), Florida, are examined in detail. These data confirm that practitioners are overwhelmingly young, white, middle‐class, unmarried males. When the practice is fatal among older practitioners, the data show that some complicating factor, such as the use of alcohol or other drugs, may have contributed to the accident. The most frequent method of inducing the asphyxia was simple hanging by rope and in most cases there was no indication nor suspicion of suicidal intent",

      "abstract": "Adolescents are at an emotionally unstable age and need social recognition and self-existence. Biologically, adolescents experience significant development of sex hormones such as testosterone and progesterone, leading to an increased attraction to the opposite sex. Socially, adolescents are highly vulnerable to entering the youth community and engaging in various juvenile delinquency activities. Therefore, sex education is necessary for adolescents to prevent promiscuity and prepare them for marriage. This study explores the importance of scientific knowledge and character in strengthening loyalty to their marriage vows. The research applies a survey method. Quantitative data are obtained from the results of the questionnaire. Data collection through personal interviews and group meetings with young people and families in St. Boniface Parish, Alasa, and Christ the King Gidӧ Parish are useful factors in this study. The data obtained were analyzed descriptively. The result showed science education, character and moral values, especially husband and wife morals, are fundamental in maintaining the sanctity of marriage. The virtues of life, especially morals, encourage a person to behave appropriately and correctly by applying moral values. Morality is defined as personal or cultural values, codes of ethics, or social customs that establish rules about right and wrong.",

      "abstract": "When I first started reading the psychological literature on homosexuality nearly 25 years ago, several omissions were painfully evident.On the positive side, studies were no longer focusing on whether or not lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were mentally disordered; their minds had been rescued from psychopathology with the 1973 removal of homosexuality from the official list of mental disorders.However, the literature I read about 'homosexuals' described people who seemed to spring from nowhere, that is, they were never children or adolescents, and did not seem to have siblings, parents, or grandparents.Nothing in the literature at the time alluded to long-term relationships, or even important friendships.The implicit portrait was of an adult homosexual person, almost always a male, living in a metropolitan area on his own (although having sex on a regular basis -this was not left out!).Although they now had their mental health restored, they still did not have lives.In essence, what was missing was any focus on their development -over their lifetimes in relationship to others, in distinct social circumstances, and at particular historical moments.For example, in the early 1980s, there were no lesbian or gay adolescents in the professional literature.The gerontological literature did not contain older adults who were lesbian or gay.Research on families did not include samesex couples or lesbian, gay, or bisexual parents.Helping to finish this fractured portrait was the problematic methodology used in early studies.Although samples were no longer drawn from clinical settings, researchers used small samples found in a limited set of urban gay venues, and were conducted with a model of sexual orientation that had two boxes, gay or heterosexual.(The bisexual box was added later, and the transgendered person -a new gender -would not appear in the psychological literature until the 21st century.)The psychological findings were decontextualized.Research never included such profoundly important factors as the widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation that sealed many in their 'closets,' the harassment and violence that made fear a normative aspect of daily existence, nor even the fact that their private sexual behavior was illegal in most parts of the country.It was remarkable to me that researchers could make generalizations.",

Both the appeal and the danger of ephemeral sex are increased because the partners are usually strangers to one another. In the positioning and signaling phases of the game, the players have already indicated their intentions. This stage, then, merely formalizes the agreement and sets the terms of the payoff. Another type of action that tends to swell the volume of sexual acts in a given facility is the simultaneous encounter, in which more than one sexual act is in process at the same time.",

      "title": "Risk Factors for the Development of Animal Cruelty",
      "abstract": "Research shows that animal cruelty shares many of the aetiologial pathways and risk factors that have been shown for other aggressive behaviors. The shared aetiology not only aids understanding of the co-occurrence that has been documented between animal cruelty and other aggressive and antisocial crimes, it also highlights the dangers over and above those to animals that are lurking where animal cruelty offenders remain unidentified and their crimes remain unsanctioned. This article reviews current understandings about the development of antisocial behaviors, including human aggression, and animal cruelty behaviors. Available research leads one to ask, when individuals have been found to be guilty of animal cruelty, what other aggressive behaviors might they be guilty of? For young children, one must ask, are they victims of child abuse, are they living in circumstances of domestic violence, and/or what is the aggression or violence that they may have been witness to? Animal cruelty, and most aggressive behaviors from the later childhood years onward, are indicators of non-normative development. Early detection of such behaviors can provide a valuable opportunity to engage in preventative intervention for young people or for appropriate sanctions to be applied for adults. Such interventions would be beneficial for all, humans and animals alike.",

In the present study, we aimed to assess the most important factors involved in the challenges related to romantic relationships among young adults born preterm. A short commutation study was carried out to review evidence finding important contributors. The results have shown that several reasons are involved in the challenges related to romantic performances among young adults born preterm. As all body organs form, grow, or develop during the second and third trimesters of gestation, preterm birth may cause a mild to severe range of postnatal structural and functional immaturities. Moreover, individuals born preterm are prone to main risks related to brain hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Impaired cognitive domain, psychiatric disease, emotional and behavioral problems may also affect learning abilities, educational and job opportunities. All these involving factors may influence peer relationships, social interactions, sexual intercourse, romantic partnership or becoming parents. In the present study, we reviewed evidence to show the negative influence of preterm birth on the establishment of a romantic relationship in adulthood. This challenge may correlate to physical, emotional, and mental health statuses as well as educational and socioeconomic characteristics of adults born preterm. Devoting all efforts to prevent preterm birth, long-term follow-up, and providing additional supports should be considered for such a high-risk group.",

The purpose of the study was to describe sexual interest and cohabiting relationships and to analyse the influence of personality and biological factors on these phenomena. An increased sexual interest or activity and frequent changes of cohabiting partners are two common characteristics of male alcoholics but these two phenomena are not interrelated. A decreased sexual interest is reported by only a minority of male alcoholics. The alcoholics with several previous cohabiting relationships stand out as being aggressive and hard drinking. The alcoholic with an increased sexual interest makes an opposite impression. He is non-aggressive, socially adjustable and unafraid of close interpersonal relations. When decreased sexual interest or activity occurs in male alcoholics, it is mainly a result of hormonal changes. Low levels of male and high levels of female sex hormones are common in these men.",

According to our results the hereditary factor in childhood is not stronger than in adulthood, with adults it is as effective. Particular neurotic symptoms show influences of the hereditary factor in respect to depressive, maladaptive oral and maladaptive aggressive disturbances of behavior and difficulties in forming interpersonal relationships. In respect to stuttering, disturbances of the urogenital system and intelligence and occupational development a certain hereditary factor is very probable.

Older intersexed people are living with the consequences of how potentially all such sexual rights have been violated, perhaps especially 'the right to equality and non-discrimination' and 'the right to autonomy and bodily integrity'. To speak of intersex ageing concerns is very much a product of recent developments in medicine. With technical advances in medicine in the latter half of the 20th century, various intersexualizing diagnoses became more common. Many of this population have histories of non-consensual medical interventions and are living with the ongoing effects, physically and emotionally, of those interventions. Many of the people appearing in Intersexion describe the shame of hiding their differences and being made to lie about 'vacationing' when they were in hospital for surgeries.",

      "abstract": "AbstractDuring the past decade there has been a proliferation of research on the topic of sex-role development. This paper presents a comprehensive, cognitively based approach to sex-role development with reference to the recent literature on social cognition. This approach uses methods that enable a better appraisal of the cognitive bases of sex-related information in even very young children. By employing research methods more relevant to the everyday experiences of young children, it is demonstrated that they are more cognitively and socially competent than the more traditional research and theories of sex-role development suggest. Thus, it is unnecessary to resort exclusively to biological proclivities to explain the early emergence of sex-typed behaviour in young children. It is also shown that boys and girls follow different developmental paths in the acquisition of sex-typed behaviour and knowledge. Boys and girls are parallel in their knowledge and performance of sex-appropriate activities. The major difference in development between boys and girls is in their knowledge and performance of activities more usually associated with the opposite sex. Thus, (a) boys imitate male models and reject female models (except when female models behave in accord with the male sex role); girls imitate both female models and, to a lesser extent, male models; (b) boys know little about girls' activities; girls are well informed about girls' and boys' activities.",

Forgé à partir du grec par un médecin français au début du XIX e siècle, le terme de ménopause signifie littéralement « arrêt des règles » mais son champ sémantique s'étend jusqu'à un objet qui n'a pas de nom propre, la « ménopause masculine », terme fréquemment utilisé dans les écrits anglo-saxons. Notre enquête menée en France auprès des femmes de 45 à 65 ans, et des hommes de 50 à 60 ans, montre que l'expérience des femmes s'étend selon un registre très étendu. Pour une forte minorité il s'agit d'un sentiment de perte majeure du fait de l'arrêt des règles et de la fécondité, ainsi qu'une perte du capital santé, du capital esthétique et surtout du capital symbolique. Pour la majorité des femmes, la ménopause constitue plutôt un non-événement, une évolution physiologique sans conséquence particulière quant à leur valeur sociale notamment. Enfin une minorité exprime une forte satisfaction. D'une part les représentations dominantes de la ménopause s'inscrivent dans le processus de la domination symbolique masculine, et d'autre part cette domination est aujourd'hui limitée à une minorité de femmes.",

Throughout centuries males forged their social identity by themselves, sharing patterns across cultures and borders. Males meet psychologists in psychotherapy, in counselling, in coaching and mentoring programs, in training and development programs. There are no Men Institutes sponsored by public funding to do research on matters and problems typical of men. In Psychology males are just a minority: they do and let others do. Paternity tests show that about one out of four may be precisely putative fathers. Sexual initiative is not a male privilege. Males express their emotions in a manly manner. Polychronous time schemes and activities are widespread after new technologies. Directive leadership has masculine connotations. Systematizing prevails among males as a way of thinking. Men get their salary after what they do and devoted time. Creativity and inventiveness seem to flow among men and many geniuses faced prosecution or were ostracized. Rarely men view themselves as centre or first sex. These are categories invented somewhere around.

In order to concentrate on the most frequently encountered complaints of the sexually maladjusted fairly unit, this paper has been arbitrarily confined to detailed consideration of the clinical problem of impotence. Presuming a lack of spinal cord pathology and certain endocrinopathies, the physiologic systems of impotence have an almost constant psychogenic origin or background. Rarely, if ever, do pathologic lesions of the urethra develop physical symptoms of sexual impotence (Hyde, 1959). From a purely physiologic point of view there are three main types of male impotence that have been encountered clinically, both in sexually maladjusted and infertile males.",

      "title": "Contextual Information Shifts Young Children’s Understanding of Gender Constancy",
      "abstract": "Children's understanding of the stability of gender over time has long been recognized as a hallmark of early childhood cognitive development. Prior research has argued that until roughly age 6, children do not understand that a person's gender identity remains consistent if the person undergoes a change in gendered behavior or appearance. However, this prior work has generally not given children any context as to why the behavior or appearance change is occurring. The present study showed U.S. three-to-five-year-olds a character (e.g. \"Johnny\") undergo such a change that occurred because of external factors (e.g. \"Johnny is wearing his sister's dress because all his clothes are dirty\"); we asked whether children would indicate that the character's gender was the same pre- and post-change. Children (N = 124, 52% girls, 66% non-Hispanic White) as young as 3 demonstrated an understanding of gender consistency and were significantly more likely to endorse gender consistency when they were, versus were not, given context for the change (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.88). Results suggest that U.S. children take context into account when conceptualizing others' genders and believe that gender is generally consistent across transformations in behavior or appearance by age 3. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of a broader literature about children's understanding of gender constancy as well as contemporary understandings of gender that sometimes accommodate the idea that a person's gender can change.",

They were presented with a series of sexually contrasted pairs of slides (heterosexual content paired with homosexual content) in a binocular device. The pictures they viewed contained specific heterosexual or homosexual visual stimuli with respect to the sexual preferences of men. It was found that perceptual reports significantly corresponded to sexual preference, with gay men reporting images of men and straight men reporting images of women.",

      "abstract": "Considerable variation in the effects of the loss of the spouse have been reported, and there is lack of agreement regarding the effects of gender and bereavement on well-being. The objective of this article is to examine time-differences in the consequences of bereavement for men and women. Cross-sectional data are used on 4642 married or widowed late mid-life and elderly people. Analyses show that bereaved participants score significantly lower on well-being, and a clear gender-effect is found in connection with the time period of bereavement. Men score considerably lower than women when they are up to two years bereaved, but not when they are bereaved longer than two years. Hence, analyses of variance revealed an interaction effect for gender * time period. In addition, while the largest part of the variance in well-being can be explained by different means of achieving well-being, the effects of marital status, gender, and adjustment to widowhood over time do not disappear completely.",

      "abstract": "Teasing is a universal phenomenon that is not confined to a certain nation, age, class, or even level of education. Teasing is mostly a disliked behavior that can be verbal or non-verbal meant to achieve a desired aim of the teaser on the teased target. It has various definitions, objectives and reasons. Teasing is double-edged; it can be innocent or malicious. The sample of this study consisted of 110 undergraduates (53 males and 57 females). It was carried out at five different intervals. It aimed to answer three questions concerning same-sex, cross-sex teasing categories and reactions. The findings of the study revealed that female-same-sex teasing expressions could be categorized under underestimation, criticism, physical appearance, academic competence, clothing, and imitation, whereas male-same-sex expressions could be categorized under underestimation, describing the target as an animal or something bad, physical appearance, relationships, cursing, and rumor. Teasing expressions directed from females to males could be categorized under underestimation, academic competence, and describing the target as an animal or something bad while teasing expressions directed from males to females could be categorized under physical appearance, underestimation, describing the teased target as an animal or something bad, clothing, and academic competence. The reactions of both females and males were the same as their reactions to the first teasing expression were mostly positive, and to the second one were mostly negative. The use of the teasing categories arrived at by the study were attributed to matters of interest among both same-sex and cross-sex. Impact of cultural background, mood, and mixing with others could also play a role in employing a certain teasing category or reaction to a teasing expression.",

      "title": "Can animal aggression be studied in an ethical manner?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Aggression is a behavior found almost universally in the animal kingdom. It is an unprovoked, hostile act that poses a threat to the victim. It is shown in many ways, including threatening body movements, vocalization, fighting, wounding and infliction of pain, sexual attack, and killing. Commonly, animals act aggressively to exclude others from their territory, to capture food, and to control populations. Displays of aggression are influenced by age (newborns and infants below a certain age do not fight), by the physical environment, by previous social experience, and by the aggression level in a particular community. One manifestation of aggression is infanticide-the killing of young by adults. It occurs in several species of animal. Human infanticide is practiced in several cultures to control population, to favor the birth of a particular sex, usually male, and in waging war. In nonhuman animals, infanticidal behavior has been described as a type of social pathology induced by overcrowding and by intense competition for scarce resources. Some investigators have suggested that infanticide may be a genetically influenced aspect of an animal’s “normal” behavioral repertory-an adaptive strategy in circumstances of shortage of food, for example. It could be interpreted as a normal matem’al culling of the litter under those conditions.",

      "title": "[A case of diaper fetishism].",
      "abstract": "Some people cannot obtain satisfaction from ordinary sexual relationships; instead they prefer alternative methods. They are referred to in psychiatric terminology as paraphiliacs. Fetishism is a type of paraphilia in which a person is sexually attracted to objects and some body parts. Most fetishists do not intend to cause harm to other people, but may have problems when others become involved in the problem. Underlying personality disorders extending through childhood are thought to be the source of the etiology. Perverted people do not wish to change their behavior pattern. They never seek treatment from a therapist. Psychological issues obviously play a crucial role in determining the choice of paraphilia and the underlying meaning of the sexual acts. Psychodynamic models (object relations theory, self psychology, drive theory) can shed light on the meaning of a perversion. In this case report, a 22- year-old man with diaper fetishism is presented. When family dynamics are considered, the mother has been described as psychologically distant from her son. The fetish object was recognized during childhood at around the age of four. During puberty, the fetish object became sexually attractive. Our patient exhibited his first perverted behavior when he was six years old. Later, he could control this behavior. At the age of twelve, the perverted behavior became sexually arousing. This paper emphasizes the diaper fetishism case through the patient's past psychiatric and medical history. Diaper fetishism is discussed in the light of forensic, cognitive and psychodynamic theories.",

      "abstract": "Violence may appear in a variety of contexts, such as private homes, public places, commercial spaces, colleges and universities, and other facilities1. It has a profound effect on people from all social classes. Because there was no standard term for violence, which made it a complicated and pervasive issue, it was not previously seen as a public health concern2. There is more to understanding violence than just tying it to empirical data. Instead, it entails making decisions about what constitutes proper and acceptable behaviour, which are influenced by societal norms, beliefs, and practices3. The deliberate use of force, real or threatened, towards themselves, another individual, an organisation or society, or oneself is what the World Health Organization, or WHO, defines as violence. This conduct has the risk of causing injury, death, psychological suffering, stunted growth, or impoverishment4. Although professional violence, including punching, kicking, shoving, hitting, shooting, and harming, has been acknowledged, until recently, little has been done to combat intellectual assault5. The intentional use of harm towards a person or group, including the threat or application of blunt force, is referred to as psychological abuse. The victim of this kind of assault may have detrimental effects on their psychological, ethical, moral, physical, and cognitive well-being6.",

Actually, S/M is a catchall term for a wide range of individual passions and practices, with an endless spectrum of possibilities for expression. Among homosexuals, S/M is institutionalized to the extent that particular symbolic acts of dominance and submission are more common than others, most of which involve no pain whatsoever. Also, an elaborate scheme of norms control certain aspects of the scene, especially the action itself. Finally, a common path of entry can be traced. The action of gay S/M is termed leathersex, and its members are leathermen. This study may serve to construct an enlightened view of gay S/M.1",

      "abstract": "Gender diversity refers to gender expressions and/or gender identity experiences that vary from the common experiences of gender. Gender-diverse people may be gender nonconforming, gender nonbinary, gender fluid, gender exploring, transgender, and so forth. Some gender-diverse individuals experience gender dysphoria and/or gender incongruence and may require gender-affirming supports, including gender-affirming medical interventions. The co-occurrence of autism and gender diversity has been highlighted in a series of studies internationally as well as through rich community expressions. Studies in gender-referred individuals reveal high rates of autism traits as well as high rates of existing autism diagnoses. Studies in autistic populations reveal greater gender diversity characteristics. The long-term course of gender diversity in autistic individuals is poorly understood. Clinical guidelines have been developed for adolescents with the co-occurrence, but much work remains: No gender-related measures have been developed and tested for use in neurodiverse populations, no programs exist to support gender-diverse neurodiverse adults, and little is known about co-occurring mental health profiles, risks, or protective factors for people with the co-occurrence. The inclusion of this chapter on co-occurring autism and gender diversity within a book on “co-occurring psychiatric conditions” is problematic, because gender diversity is not a “psychiatric condition,” but instead a form of human diversity. The diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria is useful only insomuch as it allows individuals to obtain necessary gender-related supports. The authors’ choice to include this chapter in this book reflects a compromise, motivated by the need for educating both autism and gender specialists in this common co-occurrence.",

The gay target who displayed a feminine personality elicited more disgust and was perceived as lower in gender role conformity than a gay man who displayed a masculine personality.

      "title": "Depression in adolescence and young adulthood: the difficulty to integrate motivational/emotional systems",
      "abstract": "Depression is presented as a multi-factorial bio-psycho-social expression that has evolved primarily as an effect of stressors related to the motivational/emotional systems that regulate the BrainMind in our relationship with conspecifics. These stressors may be caused by two sources of threat, firstly, the loss of bonding with the caregiver and later with a partner and/or group which relates to the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system, secondly, social defeat as an expression of the social competition and social dominance. The sexual maturity drives the individual to social competition and social dominance, even if the latter often occurs before sexual maturity, e.g., chickens, dogs, non-human primates, and humans. Depression is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in mammals to terminate both separation anxiety, so as to protect the vulnerable social brain from the consequences of prolonged separation anxiety, and the stress of social competition when social defeat is predictable. Adolescence and Young adulthood are particularly susceptible to these two types of threat because of human developmental characteristics that are summarized by the term neoteny. This refers to the slowing down of growth and development, resulting in both a prolonged period of dependence on a caring/protective adult and the persistence of juvenile characteristics throughout life. Therefore, neoteny makes the transition from childhood to sexual maturity more dramatic, making the integration of the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system with the dynamics of social competition and dominance more stressful and a source of depression. Stress is an expression of the HPA-Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis that articulates with other systems, mainly the autonomic nervous system and the immune-inflammatory system. The latter is believed to be one of the most significant components in the dynamics of depressive processes, connected to the prodromes of its activation in childhood, under the pressure of environmental and relational stressors which can lead to learned helplessness. The recurrence of stressors makes it easier for the immune-inflammatory system to be activated in later life, which could make a significant contribution to the establishment of a depressive disease. The possible contribution of children's identification processes with their parents' depressive personalities through observational learning is considered.",

Sexual behaviour, when discussed within a particular social context such as premarital, marital, or extramarital sexual behaviour, refers to those acts by an individual which involve another individual (imagined or real) and which centre around sexual gratification. Sexual interaction has at least two distinct functions: procreation, which accounts for only a tiny portion of coital activity in contemporary society, and recreation, which has always accounted for most sexual interaction, although the extent of recreational sex may be different for males and females. But 'revolution' is perhaps an overstatement if one considers sexual performance, values, and the attitudes that are more deeply rooted in the socialization process.",

Tackling these issues requires sensitivity to nuances of communication and a commitment to clarity and consistency. It also benefits from an awareness of different approaches to ethical theory. Many of the ethical problems encountered in genetics relate to tensions between the wishes or interests of different people, sometimes even people who do not (yet) exist or exist as embryos, either in an established pregnancy or in vitro. Concern for the long-term welfare of a child or young person, or possible future children, or for other members of the family, may lead to tensions felt by the patient (client) in genetic counselling. Differences in perspective may also arise between the patient and professional when the latter recommends disclosure of information to relatives and the patient finds that too difficult, or when the professional considers the genetic testing of a child, sought by parents, to be inappropriate. The expectations of a patient's community may also lead to the differences in perspective between patient and counsellor. Recent developments of genetic technology permit genome-wide investigations. These have generated additional and more complex data that amplify and exacerbate some pre-existing ethical problems, including those presented by incidental (additional sought and secondary) findings and the recognition of variants currently of uncertain significance, so that reports of genomic investigations may often be provisional rather than definitive. Experience is being gained with these problems but substantial challenges are likely to persist in the long term.",

This statement of the obvious is only made because too frequently old people are not treated as people, and this is particularly so if they behave abnormally, or show other evidence that there may be something amiss with their mind. If an elderly person becomes agitated, miserable, expresses odd ideas, becomes a little forgetful, or in a multitude of ways appears to deviate from what some consider normal, it is likely that he or she will be considered 'senile'. The word senile carries an unpleasant and even censorious effect. 'You are going senile' and 'senile old fool' are expressions of abuse, and even when the word is used in a kindly context, such as 'You should make allowances, she is senile' or 'The poor old thing is going senile', the inference is still one that suggests that the old person is ceasing to be a person.",

      "abstract": "The literature on sexual activity and ageing has grown substantially in the past 20 years. Until recently, a medicalized perspective dominated. In the past decade research based on a social-relational perspective has emerged. We summarize recent work from both perspectives. In addition to the effects of disease on sexual functioning of men and women over the age of 50, this review emphasizes sexual expression among older couples, newly emerging topics such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the older adult, and older lesbian and gay sexuality. Sexual functioning in both males and females continues in later life, while sexual satisfaction within their relationships is dependent upon individual responses to age-related changes. As the life course continues, some older married couples begin to desire emotional intimacy, stability, and continuity in addition to or instead of penetrative sex. This also appears to be characteristic of relationships involving two (older) women. As the world's population over 50 continues to grow there is an increasing interest in older adult's sexuality. This signals progress toward understanding healthy sexual relationships.",

      "title": "¿Sexualidad en la diversidad o diversidad en la sexualidad? Nuevos retos para una nueva cultura sexual",
      "abstract": "In this paper we take a look at a small representation of what plurality in sexuality implies. Examples, such as that of women, people with functional diversity, and people of other sexual orientations and/or gender, show that there is no single sexuality, but that there are as many sexualities as there are people. People with functional diversity have suffered and suffer discrimination in all aspects of life, including sexuality.That is why, in December 2006, the United Nations approved the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The sexuality of women, men, and those who do not identify with sex-gender binarism, but all of them with functional diversity, tend to experience sexuality in a way which is to a certain extent, distorted. They are persons who are considered asexual, and consequently, treated in a infantilized way throughout their life cycle (especially, women with physical, deafblind, intellectual and/or developmental or mental diversity); or, on the contrary, some of them, in particular, women with intellectual and/or developmental or mental diversity, are interpreted as hypersexual persons who do not know how to control themselves. However, if we want to open the normative horizon to sexuality, to its science and its practices, we will include from a social and rights perspective a multiplicity of realities that are diverse sexualities, but which would traditionally have been pathologised and treated from the perspective of a disease model.Keywords: Sexuality, diversity, sexology, functional diversity, sexual rights.",

      "title": "Be Aware of Bullying: A Critical Public Health Responsibility",
      "abstract": "Health professionals have a responsibility to become informed and raise community awareness about the nature of bullying and its link to serious health risks.The term \"bullying\" refers to a group of aggressive behaviors to which one person is exposed repeatedly and over time by one or more others.Bullying encompasses physical aggression (hitting, pushing, punching, or kicking); verbal harassment (threatening, teasing, name calling, or making faces or dirty gestures); and indirect or relational mistreatment (ignoring someone or excluding him or her on purpose).Daring a person to perform a dangerous, illegal, or inappropriate action under the threat of losing approval among the members of a group is also considered a form of bullying.What is understood as bullying varies according to human developmental stages and cultures.Many people may have experienced or witnessed bullying behaviors during childhood and adolescence that were then regarded as part of growing up or a rite of passage.Today, published evidence supports the view that bullying is a very toxic form of abuse prevalent across the lifespan on a global scale.It occurs not only in schools, but over the Internet and cellular phones, in the neighborhood, at summer camp, at home between siblings, as hazing among young adults in colleges or the armed forces, and in the workplace.During the last 2 decades, bullying episodes have been linked to hundreds of deaths due to suicide, accidental injuries, and homicide.Adolescents who are bullied and those who bully others are often subject to other serious health, safety, and educational risks including emotional and physical symptoms; eating disorders; self-inflicted, accidental, and perpetrated injuries; abusing over-the-counter medication; hurting people on purpose; and frequent absenteeism.Bullying at the workplace has been linked to cardiovascular disease, fibromyalgia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder.The development of social phobia among adults has been shown to be associated with teasing or bullying during childhood.Recently published longitudinal studies have established that psychiatric symptoms and conditions can be antecedents and consequences of bullying.Furthermore, young males who have been frequent bullies and bully victims are at high risk for future criminality.www.virtualmentor.org",

Sixty-one young adults (M age = 19.2), twenty-one middle-aged adults (M age = 45), and fifteen older adults (M age = 71.4) gave attributions and affects for self-chosen situations, which were classified as social or nonsocial. The attributions and affects were coded according to Blank's scheme with attributions dichotomized into internal and external, and stable and unstable. Middle-age and older adults were more likely than young adults to attribute failure to external causes and to describe more social than nonsocial situations. Consistent age differences in attributional stability were not found nor were there age differences in attributional internality for success outcomes.",

A review of representative gynecologic and psychiatric publications dating back to the mid-nineteenth century tend to confirm these widely held beliefs. More contemporary epidemiologic and clinical studies fail to demonstrate a specific entity of menopausal depression and, in fact, show a decline in the prevalence of depression among women in this age group. Likewise, studies on sexual activity and interest among middle-aged women fail to demonstrate a consistent and predictable decline, but show rather wide variability. The presence of a suitable male partner appears to play a more important role than age per se.",

      "abstract": "The dissatisfaction of men due to their penile size is found in a number of studies. Concerns can be focused on the penile length or width or even both, whether erect or flaccid. Men who are worried about the penile size also want to increase the size of the penis. Concerns about men’s penile size are also increasing because they think normal penile size is what is shown in pornography. These worries can affect self-esteem, sexual function, and satisfaction, to physical and mental health. Small penis anxiety is an anxiety that arises when a man observes his flaccid penile size and feels concerned that his penile size is less than the normal size. In addition, this concern persists even though it has been refuted by clinical examination. Penile dysmorphic disorder is excessive self-concern, distress, and a preoccupation with trivial or even non-existent deficiencies in penile size and shape that can lead to impaired function. Until now, there have not been effective guidelines for managing patients with complaints of penile size. Some of the treatments that can be conducted are psychosexual counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, penile traction devices, and invasive procedures. Various modalities of therapy have been tried to overcome excessive concern about penile size. Yet, so far, no good results have been obtained. Thus, clear and effective guidelines are needed to make treatment can be carried out properly.",

El objetivo fue interpretar el significado que tiene la sexualidad para los adultos mayores. MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Es una investigación cualitativa, descriptiva. La unidad de observación fueron los adultos mayores hombres y mujeres de 60 a 71 años, que refirieron como estado civil: solteros, convivientes o casados. Se formaron tres grupos focales. RESULTADOS: Los adultos mayores están interesados en la sexualidad, son conscientes de sus limitantes para disfrutar su vida sexual como: disminuida fortaleza física y problemas de salud. Para las mujeres, mantener relaciones sexuales es parte de su necesidad emocional, condicionan su disfrute sexual al amor de su pareja, considerando un acto de entrega y afecto al hombre que aman, pueden mostrarle su cuerpo desnudo. Hay temor en los varones a no tener una respuesta sexual adecuada, consideran que pueden satisfacer a sus parejas no solo con la penetración sino también con caricias íntimas. Los varones tienen claro que sus parejas han disminuido su libido como producto de la menopausia, lo que limita su disfrute sexual. La mayoría no muestra predisposición a mejorar sus condiciones, no utilizan fantasías sexuales para lograr placer sexual. Tampoco tienen sueños eróticos que los ayuden a lograr mayor excitación para una mejor respuesta sexual. CONCLUSIÓN: Los adultos mayores tienen vivencias de su sexualidad con limitaciones propias de su edad.",

Kasus terbanyak yaitu sekitar 6,6 juta anak penyandang Tuna Grahita dilecehkan oleh orang-orang yang tidak bertanggungjawab bahkan ada yang dicabuli gurunya sendiri. Dari kasus pelecehan pada anak tuna grahita ini mengakibatkan anak tersebut mengalami trauma bahkan ada yang sampai bunuh diri karena merasa ketakutan dan merasa bahwa dirinya telah dianiaya. Pelecehan seksual terhadap anak tuna grahita tinggi dikarenakan anak tuna grahita belum memahami betul mengenai edukasi seksual sehingga anak tuna grahita cenderung dapat dimanipulasi oleh pelaku pelecahan seksual.

After all, genital stimulation, whether by a man or a woman, sends the same sensory signals to the brain. Yet somehow the sex, appearance, and identity of the person providing the stimulation are all critical determinants of whether or not the stimulation is perceived as pleasurable. Many people, heterosexual and homosexual alike, are strongly attracted to only one of the two sexes. And, all things being equal, most people would prefer an attractive partner to an unattractive one. Even then, whether or not pleasure is experienced is significantly influenced by who the attractive, appropriately sexed pleasure-giver is, not to mention the context in which the stimulation occurs. Certain partners, such as family members, arc taboo. Others arc considered undesirable, or even repulsive, for whatever reason.",

Need and SigniÀ cance of the StudyPopulation aging is the process by which older individuals become a proportionally larger share of the total population.It has been one of the most distinctive demographic events in the twentieth century.India is presently undergoing such a demographic transition with 72 million elderly persons above 60 years of age, which is expected to increase to 179 million in 2031 and further to 301 million in 2051.During the aging process, changes experienced by the elderly, such as possible loss of a spouse, À nancial difÀ culties, lack of familiar and social support and occurrence of co-morbidities may frequently contribute to psychological imbalances, especially depression.Incidence of depression and poor self-esteem are the major problems in old age which has a strong relation with each other (WHO, 2013).The martial art of Tai chi can relieve depression and boost self esteem, it is designed to promote relaxation and improve balance, strength and psychological wellbeing.A growing number of studies support the positive impact of Tai chi on many aspects of psychological wellbeing.This motivated the researcher to undertake this study.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sixty-eight engaged couples, 113 newly weds, and 222 couples married for over 5 years, were studied for a number of physical, psychological and socioeconomic traits. The measurements were repeated a year later. Correlations were highest for age (r = 0·454, 0·903 and 0·888 respectively). They were also high for height (but not weight), neuroticism (but not extroversion), occupation, education, religion and smoking. Similarities were already present about the time of marriage, with little convergence or divergence. Thus, men do not grow to resemble their wives, nor vice versa.",

We discuss the impact of \"coming out,\" or defining a homosexual orientation, on the development and identity formation of youths who come out during adolescence. The process of coming out is presented as entailing four broad dimensions: recognizing oneself as lesbian or gay; exploring one's sexual orientation through the gay and lesbian community; disclosing one's sexual orientation to others; and becoming more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Some of the major challenges faced by these youths are described, and future directions for research efforts are discussed.",

Part of the explanation for this continuing lack of clarity lies in the tendency to treat different components of socioeconomic status …",

In those groups where widowhood and retirement are relatively rare either change in status places the individual in a deviant position among his peers, differentiates his interests and experiences from those of his associates, and thereby exerts a detrimental effect on friendships. In those structural contexts, however, where these changes in status are prevalent, it is the still married or employed individual who occupies a deviant position in relation to his peers and whose social life therefore tends to become more restricted.",

Como norma general el inicio de la actividad sexual coincide con la adolescencia y los adolescentes no suelen tener conciencia del peligro de las enfermedades de transmisión sexual, sin embargo, son más conocedores de los métodos anticonceptivos, pero dejan de lado las ETS. Una buena educación sexual desarrolla tanto la salud del individuo como la construcción de un modelo de comportamiento integral que engloba el equilibrio personal, las habilidades comunicativas y un buen desarrollo de la afectividad1. “Las infecciones de transmisión sexual se transmiten fundamentalmente a través de las relaciones sexuales desprotegidas sin uso del condón o preservativo, con penetración de la vía vaginal, anal u oral, y representan mundialmente un serio problema, tanto en términos de salud como económicos y sociales”2. Para realizar una intervención eficaz para prevenir dichas enfermedades, se precisa de equipos multidisciplinares de profesionales relacionados con la salud, éstos deben prestar una atención de calidad al paciente, de una manera uniforme y eficaz, promoviendo una serie de hábitos de vida saludables y un mejor conocimiento para evitar las transmisiones de ETS. Se necesita una adecuada organización, coordinada entre la atención primaria, especialistas y centro educativos.

      "abstract": "Commonly debated in the public sector as well as in academic circles and scientific research, the basic concepts of the phenomenon of sexual orientation are being confused or simply recognized inadequately. This especially affects the conceptual understanding of sexual behaviour, sexual orientation, but also sexual identification and sexual identity. Homosexual behaviour does not have to correspond to or be the cause of homosexual orientation. Homosexual behaviour may not necessarily be an indication of homosexual orientation. Homosexual orientation has deeper biological roots than homosexual behaviour, which, in humans, is strongly influenced by culture. The phenomenon of sexual orientation does not have to be perceived as a positively dichotomous occurrence anymore. Quite the opposite, it seems it is a continuum of various sexual orientations that can have their own specific biological and socio-cultural roots. The psychological concept of the sexual identi­fication process suggests there can be a discrepancy between the psychological and the biological aspect of a single phenomenon, a discrepancy between sexual orientation [with no regard to behaviour] and sexual identification. The second part of the article seeks to outline the complex issue of gender conformity and nonconformity, which is closely related to the topic of homosexual orientation and, furthermore, is significantly overshadowed hy numerous 'popular myths', common among laymen. ln gender nonconformity we distinguish between Childhood Gender Nonconformity [CGN] appearing before puberty and Continuous Gender Identity [CGI]. Childhood gender nonconformity is one of the most common [although not completely accurate] predictors of future homosexual orientation. As far as the 'popular myths' connected withthis issue are concerned, the most widespread yet overly simplified idea is that every homosexually oriented male is positioned nearer to the feminine end of the masculinity-femininity scale. The article aims to illustrate that the problem is in reality more complex: actually, it is possible to distinguish more types of male homosexual orientation.",

This is probably a minimum estimate because many cases, particularly those involving intrafamilial abuse, go unreported. Identification of sexual abuse depends upon a high index of suspicion. Occasionally a child spontaneously discloses the abuse. Others, especially young children, may manifest specific behaviors indicative of abuse, such as sexual acting-out, or less specific behaviors suggesting psychologic stress. Only a small proportion of children have genital findings or sexually transmitted diseases indicating sexual contact. The evaluation of such cases requires special skills of a number of professionals who understand the legal, social, psychologic, and medical ramifications of this information.",

However, the origins and early development of this skill have not been well investigated. To clarify the mechanisms for the acquisition of this skill, we examined whether 6- to 8-month-old infants show a preference for a more trustworthy-looking person. Results showed that infants preferred a trustworthy face to an untrustworthy one when both faces were high in dominance. This difference was not seen when both faces were low in dominance. Moreover, this preference disappeared when the faces were upside down. These findings suggest that the perception of trustworthiness based on facial appearance emerges in early development with little social experience. Further research is needed to verify whether infants also perceive other traits, such as competence.",

This article questions one key part of that theory: the hypothesis that children recognize disgust from its purported facial signal. Over the first 5 years, children experience disgust, produce facial expressions of disgust, develop a concept of disgust, understand and produce the word disgust or a synonym, know about disgust's causes and consequences, and infer disgust in others from a situation or a behavior. Yet, only gradually do these children come to \"recognize\" disgust specifically from the \"disgust face\" found in standardized sets of the facial expressions of basic emotions. Improvement is gradual, with more than half of children matching the standard disgust face to disgust only at around 9 years of age and with subsequent improvement continuing gradually until the late teens or early adulthood. Up to age 8, a majority of children studied believe that the standard disgust face indicates anger. Rather than relying on an already known signal value, children may be actively learning to interpret the expression.",

In this exploratory research, we are pointing out a kind of potentially less than eight months old infants meeting mediatised by caretakers in front of meeting mediatised by toys, if infants are exposed to peers very early. It is suggested by these first contacts, that differentiation between peer and physical object, named « Social directed behaviors » by E. Mueller doesn't proceed from the babys' dialogued actions structure, but rather develops independently to the « interpersonal contingency » preludes. This one is beginning at about third or fourth months with repeating contiguous actions. If social interactions are getting on from one side direction to both side direction of peer actions dependency, in temporal contiguity, indeed, they appeared later than eight months. In fact, they involve « contingency between social directed behaviors » as Mueller explains. But, I thought this one is proceeding from peer differentiation with dialogued actions 'structure integration. To catch those very young coming into contacts, the observer is fitting up a special situation which put down the threshold of first contacts with or without objects, then taking up a special « clinical standardized behavior » appropriated to mediatise potential contacts, he is redirecting babys' attention to near at hand peers. We illustrate this outline by some examples from about forty observations. These first data suggest that both interactions systems — parent-infant and infant-infant — are coming from the same initial contingencial perception to the contingencial surrounding responses. Their mutual consequential effects would be better interpretated as a joint than as a parallel development.",

      "abstract": "The area of psychosexual dysfunction in the elderly has been relatively ignored and very little research has been conducted into the aetiology, assessment, and treatment of such disorders. Many negative attitudes have been held traditionally relating to the sexual behaviour of older people, and this may account for the reluctance of many elderly clients to seek help, and for the lack of attention paid by helping professionals. The number of referrals for sex therapy from older persons is now beginning to increase, and evidence confirms that the majority of healthy older persons remain sexually active and sexually capable throughout their later years. Although there is a marked lack of empirical research, case studies suggest that cognitive-behavioural approaches offer promise in the treatment of psychosexual dysfunction in the elderly. Factors are discussed that relate specifically to older clients in the application of a cognitive-behavioural approach to assessment and therapy.",

Certainly, the reproductive processes such as pregnancy and childbirth occur in the female body. For this reason, men have never been considered as the subjects of reproduction. However, it is now becoming clearer that men are also involved in reproduction. This paper therefore aims to clarify men's reproductive experience by re-establishing men as reproductive subjects. Specifically, based on interviews with ten men who are actively engaged in childcare and are highly interested in reproduction, describe the actual reproductive experience of men that has been a black box.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Envisioning sexual fantasies as any image or mental settingthat is sexually exciting or erotic for the individual, the present work aims to study the nature of the relationship between sexual fantasies and gender, sexual orientation, and some of the different dimensions of psychological well-being, such as life satisfaction and satisfaction with sex life. The present study was developed through a sample of 569 participants, aged between 18 and 29 years old, obtained by completing a Sociodemographic Questionnaire, Wilson’s Sexual Fantasies Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Satisfaction with Sex Life Scale. The findings revealed that, although there are no statistically significant gender differences concerning the sex drive, there were differences in Exploratory content, favoring the male gender, and BDSM, emphasized by the female gender in comparison. The occurrence of cross-orientation fantasies was also verified, proving to be significant for the heterosexual group for the item “Being much sought after by the same-sex” with women reporting more frequently than men. There was also a significant mediation between Satisfaction with Life and Intimate Fantasies, through Satisfaction with Sex Life. These results reinforce the breadth that sexual fantasies have, both in areas closer to sexual expression (e.g., gender, sexual orientation) and in more peripheral areas (e.g., psychological well-being), proving that sexual fantasies – and their capacity for arousal – relate to one’s psychological well-being.",

Bien avant les premiers articles scientifiques, la litterature et le theâtre mettent en exergue les effets controverses de ce breuvage sur les relations amoureuses et sexuelles. Des publications recentes rapportent que l'ingestion de faible quantite de boissons alcoolisees ne modifie pas les comportements ni les competences sexuelles contrairement aux idees recues d'une amelioration des performances et de l'eveil sexuel. Lors de consommations moderees ou importantes, l'activite sexuelle masculine et feminine est alteree et caracterisee par une alteration de la sensibilite, une perte de l'envie sexuelle, des retards ou des absences d'orgasmes et d'ejaculations. L'alcool est implique de facon recurrente dans les violences sexuelles mais il semble qu'il soit une comorbidite associee a un trouble de la personnalite plus qu'un moteur en soi. La consommation ethylique altere le controle de ses propres pulsions et aussi la perception des reactions de l'autre selon la theorie de la myopie alcoolique. L'influence du milieu intervient aussi dans les facteurs favorisant les agressions. Les conduites sexuelles a risque pourraient aussi etre favorisees par l'alcool. Cependant, ces donnees sont controversees et font egalement intervenir d'autres facteurs comme la personnalite de l'individu, l'influence socio-culturelle, les campagnes de prevention... Malgre une association negative entre l'alcool et les comportements sexuels, les etudes sont contradictoires quant au lien de cause a effet. Il existe de nombreuses limitations methodologiques et il parait actuellement difficile de generaliser les resultats obtenus. De nombreux efforts restent encore a fournir pour comprendre precisement le lien entre alcool et sexualite.",

As assessed by a modification of the Purpose-in-Life Test, the amount of purpose did not vary per se with age or sex. Similarly, the sources of meaning did not alter across time or sex. Themes of involvement emerged as the salient sources of meaning and included love, work, births of children, independent pursuits, accidents, illnesses, deaths, separations, or divorces, and to a lesser extent major purchases. The common sources and their timing are discussed within the context of a lifespan developmental model.",

Temperamental characteristics and experiences of child rearing are associated with children's prosocial behavior. However, little research has examined the associations between prosocial behavior and either temperamental inhibition or paternal child rearing. This study examined the contributions of maternal and paternal parenting and inhibition at 2 years to displays of prosocial behavior toward mothers and unfamiliar adults by 46 male and 42 female preschoolers. There were no direct links between toddler inhibition or fathers' parenting and prosocial behavior 2 years later, although protective maternal parenting predicted prosocial behavior. Toddlers' inhibition and gender moderated the links between maternal parenting and prosocial behavior. Maternal parenting was most strongly predictive of the prosocial behavior of more highly inhibited girls, suggesting there may be temperament- and gender-specific pathways for the development of positive characteristics.",

      "abstract": "We have little robust empirical evidence that articulates what being lonely means to older people and even less knowledge about what loneliness means to older widows and widowers; this article addresses that deficit. We undertook a re-analysis of 125 interviews with older people (aged 55-98) that explored their experiences of widowhood. In this article, we focus on those interviews in which participants described themselves as experiencing loneliness by the spontaneous use of terms such as ’’lonely’’, ’’loneliness’’ or ’’lonesome’’. Almost half of the participants (42%) described themselves in that way without any prompting from the interviewer. In terms of understanding and describing the meaning of loneliness, 50% explained loneliness in terms of absence of either their spouse, a physical presence in the house or people. One-third (34%) discussed loneliness in relation to time and place: night, weekends and home, and 4% described the emotional impact of loneliness. Fifteen per cent just said they were lonely without elaboration, assuming a common understanding of what loneliness means. Our findings suggest that widowed people’s understanding and experience of loneliness resonates with the concept of ’’emotional’’ loneliness, resulting from the loss of significant social and emotional attachment. This has important implications for the types of interventions that may be appropriate for remediating loneliness in this group.",

Having children can give vital meaning and purpose to people’s lives. Many women race against a “biological clock”—the fact that difficulties having a healthy baby skyrocket after age 40. Hence, miscarriages and failures to conceive can feel devastating. The fact that friends of the same age are having children can heighten these strains. Men with little or no sperm often feel guilty, ashamed, and less “macho” and are uncomfortable discussing infertility, even with their doctors, hampering communication and referrals. Outsiders, including patients, parents, siblings, extended family, and friends, may fail to appreciate these travails and ask or push prospective parents about having children, unaware of these impediments. Stigma and misunderstandings regarding infertility persist.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation reflects disruptions in the integration of memories, perception, and identity into a coherent sense of self, and may develop following childhood maltreatment. The preschool years were identified as an important period for the development of dissociation. However, prior research has not examined the development of dissociation during this time. In order to address this gap, evidence of dissociation in 45 maltreated children, assessed for sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect, was compared with dissociation in 33 nonmaltreated children. Rather than depend on adult observer reports of behavior, the study sought to gain an understanding of dissociation from the child's own point of view. Because self-reports have limitations with such young children, a measure of dissociation evidenced in children's narrative story-stem completions was utilized. Maltreated children, especially physically abused children and sexually abused children, demonstrated more dissociation than did nonmaltreated children. Moreover, during the preschool period maltreated and nonmaltreated children followed different trajectories such that dissociation increased for maltreated children but did not do so for nonmaltreated children. Findings suggest that although the self is normatively integrated during the preschool period, it becomes increasingly fragmented for some maltreated children. Results are discussed in terms of cascading effects of maltreatment throughout development, and the importance of developmentally sensitive interventions.",

Dans ce registre, l'attention se focalise actuellement sur des adolescents a problemes multiples ou sur des enfants prepuberes qui apparaissent comme des handicapes psychosociaux et/ou comme des agresseurs (physiques ou sexuels) potentiels. Les plus marginaux parmi ces adolescents sont representes par ceux qui abusent sexuellement d'enfants plus jeunes. Ils apparaissent au regard de certains comme des « abuseurs sexuels » comparables aux delinquants sexuels adultes. Suivant un raisonnement tres lineaire de cause a effet, certains professionnels pensent que l'ensemble des mineurs qui commettent des abus sexuels risquent de devenir des abuseurs a l'âge adulte et qu'il faut les reeduquer de la maniere la plus efficace possible. Ainsi, et au risque d'une radicalisation et d'une stigmatisation abusive, interpretative et systematique, les cliniciens multiplient dans les pays anglo-saxons des programmes de traitement adaptes a cette problematique. Afin d'eviter cet ecueil, une evaluation clinique fine et rigoureuse devrait permettre d'orienter les prises de decision d'une maniere mieux adaptee. Autant les profils de personnalite des adolescents qui transgressent sexuellement doivent faire l'objet d'une evaluation diagnostique multidisciplinaire, autant les circonstances de leurs passages a l'acte, les caracteristiques de leur(s) victime(s) et la nature de leur(s) offense(s) apportent une meilleure comprehension de cette problematique. L'orientation therapeutique de ces adolescents transgresseurs sexuels devrait s'elaborer a partir d'un examen medicopsychosocial complet et specifique pratique dans un cadre institutionnel eprouve par des reperes ethiques et juridiques solides.

On average, adolescents showed moderate levels of ambivalence. Younger adolescents, students from the highest school track, adolescents with less positive body image, those with higher love attitudes, those who did not take the initiative to have intercourse, and those feeling pressured to have sex showed higher levels of ambivalence during their decisions. Higher levels of decisional ambivalence about having intercourse were associated with a later age at the time of first intercourse and with a lower probability of contraceptive use. This study concludes that some levels of ambivalence are common in young people's decisions about having coitus as they have to negotiate contradictory sexual scripts, beliefs, and needs.",

Method : This qualitative study with a conventional content analysis was conducted in 2014 and 2015 wherein 26 Iranian married men and women were individually interviewed. Results: Sexual talk with the spouse is the conversation about planning, performance and evaluation of sexual relationship that leads to sexual agreement, intimacy, resolving the existing problems and greater sexual compatibility and satisfaction of the couple. Sexual talk should be romantic, pacific, clear, continuous, with admiration and without shame, sarcasm, anger, comparison, reproach. Couples can express their views about the partner's sexual behavior, but expressing partner's incurable physical problems is not helpful. Shyness, fear of being stigmatized as impolite and promiscuous, fear of being rejected or breaking pride, to expect the spouse to read minds, lack of opportunities, presence of children and failing to receive sexual conversation skills from adolescent are among the main barriers against sexual talk with the spouse conclousion : Sexual talk with the spouse is necessary throughout the marital life: During the early days of marriage, in order to attain initial sexual coordination and agreement and to avoid early divorce and after several years of marriage, in order to give variety and freshness in relationship and to resolve the problems.

      "abstract": "Are young people lonely?Loneliness is a subjective experience of social isolation.It is related to the perceived quality -rather than quantity -of a person's relationships.Loneliness is characterised by feelings such as social disconnection and feeling misunderstood.It is also associated with poorer physical and mental health outcomes and represents an emerging public health problem.Loneliness can affect anyone, but it may be particularly common among young people.Adolescents and young adults are often well-connected to strong social structures such as families, friends, schools, universities, work environments, social media, sport, and interest groups.However, critical transitions that characterise youth (e.g.leaving school and/or home, beginning higher education or work) can be stressful and compromise these connections and supports, increasing social vulnerability, loneliness, and isolation. While young people are often well-connected to strong social structures, critical transitions that characterise youth can be stressful and compromise these connections and supports, increasing social vulnerability, loneliness, and isolationLittle is known about the extent and impacts of loneliness among adolescents and young adults.",

      "title": "The adolescent and contraception.",
      "abstract": "Coital activity is often initiated during adolescence, and adolescents, like many adults, do not behave in purely rational ways and frequently fail to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Public attention is focused on adolescent pregnancies because of their increasing number and because the consequences are usually catastrophic. Unplanned pregnancies can have physical, psychosocial, and prenatal effects. It is important from both the individual and societal perspective that high priority be given to the task of preventing adolescent pregnancy. The health care provider, to gain the trust of the adolescent, must be open, honest, and willing to consider the young person's feelings and motivations. In addition to historical data and physical examination, the choice of a contraceptive method is based on individual preferences involving personal, familial, religious, and societal beliefs as well as sexual practice. A decision involving birth control for the adolescent can be complicated by parental influence and involvement. The teenage years are frequently a time of embarrassment about the physical maturation and biological functioning of the body. Birth control methods which require a person to touch himself/herself or to be used at the time of sexual intercourse may be unacceptable to the teenager. Fertility awareness techniques, such as basal body temperature, rhythm, and cervical mucus methods are inexpensive but call for a high degree of personal motivation. The use of a diaphragm requires an office visit and a pelvic examination for fitting and prescription. Contraceptive foam, suppositories, and condoms can be easily obtained over-the-counter for a minimal cost, and a moderate degree of personal motivation is needed for their effective use. Though effective, abortions should not be recommended indiscriminately. Permanent contraceptive methods are not recommended for the adolescent. The IUD and oral contraceptives (OCs) are recommended for adolescents who are unwilling to touch themselves or who desire a birth control method which can be used apart from the act of sexual intercourse. Both are highly effective, but there are important factors to consider in their prescription. Both methods require an initial office visit and pelvic examination and an additional procedure for the insertion of the IUD. Follow-up visits are essential and a prescription is necessary for the OCs. Cost can be prohibitive for the adolescent. Both have possible side effects contributing to mild to major discomfort.",

However, a good deal of sex differences in health issues have their origins in the genes on the sex chromosomes themselves and in X inactivation-the developmental program that equalizes their expression in males and females. Most females are mosaics, having a mixture of cells expressing either their mother's or father's X-linked genes. Often, cell mosaicism is advantageous, ameliorating the deleterious effects of X-linked mutations and contributing to physiological diversity. As a consequence, most X-linked mutations produce male-only diseases. Yet, in some cases the dynamic interactions between cells in mosaic females lead to female-specific disease manifestations.",

To address this question, this study compared pupillary responses of heterosexual men and women to naked and dressed portraits of male and female adult film actors. Pupillary responses corresponded with observers' self-reported sexual orientation, such that dilation occurred during the viewing of opposite-sex people, but were comparable for naked and dressed targets. These findings indicate that pupillary responses provide a sex-specific measure, but are not sensitive to sexually explicit content.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "Introduction for the editors “LADIES FIRST!” This phrase today, perhaps more than the custom it refers to, sounds off, ill-advised, antiquated at best. One can hardly imagine a native speaker — and it would be a man, wouldn’t it? — uttering it at all, except humorously or with thinly veiled hostility. On “ladies,” the OED is loquacious — a very good read, and endlessly instructive. This word dates to the Middle Ages, and among its oldest senses are those that attribute some form of authority, to either a “woman who rules over subjects, a queen” or to the “female head of a household; a woman who has authority over servants, attendants, or slaves.” Chivalrous, religious, and courtly meanings follow in later centuries, with the more general and enduring usage — a mark of respect or courtesy — toward the end of this arc. The pejorative, sexist, and misogynist content implicit in nearly all such forms of address, not surprisingly, seems roughly coeval with the privileges it pretends to bestow. This is the master’s house, after all. The OED notes as well how the word appears, “In later use also (chiefly N. Amer.) in less formal contexts, sometimes with overtones of brusqueness or hostility.” Others may not agree, but I find this comment particularly revealing. The lexicographers cite a Canadian newspaper: “He said, ‘Look lady, you can deal with me or you can deal with the police’” (London Free Press, Nexis 15, July 4, 2007). Even more striking, perhaps, is the etymology of the term: “lady,” it turns out, comes from the Old English “hláfdige,” or “loaf-kneader,” with “lord,” correspondingly, from the Old English “hláford, once hláfweard,” namely, “loaf-keeper.” On the nature of the loaf, little is said (or needs to be). The through line uniting all these senses, etymological and lexical — the rope woven from each varied strand — is vocative. Throughout history, patriarchy has called women into assigned places and roles for them. These days, we often hear idle talk about our postfeminist or postracial society; in such moments, I generally think to myself, Well, clearly we’re not yet postidiocy. Certainly the two stories that open this issue, by Elizabeth Denton and Amy Collier, put the lie to that postfeminist fairy tale; both explore creative female lives framed in a world that still prefers its women procreative. Elsewhere, though separated by continents and cultures, Siobhan Phillips and Zaher Omareen (in an ALTA Award–winning translation by Alice Guthrie) map the mystical relations of production and [End Page 176] reproduction, demonstrating that the ingestion of food may well be our most deeply political act. And here the psychodelirotogenetical art of Dorothy Iannone — also featured in this issue — can lend a hand: one look at her cookbooks and you’re hooked. Similarly, in praise of the Folly Cove Designers, Jennifer Scanlon recovers a story from modern feminism’s pupal stage, showing us once again that all real progress is collective. Or perhaps I should say “teneral,” as Taije Silverman puts it in her poem “Grief,” one of this number’s lyrical highlights. The OED tells us that Silverman’s adjective is used to describe “the imperfect imago of a neuropterous insect, when it has just emerged from the pupa state, and is still soft.” We are none of us, ladies or otherwise, there yet: as Christa Romanosky’s second-person recipe for disaster suggests, knowing better is never enough. Such suffering is voiced also during Tim Seibles’s “Walk”: “the suspicion / that life would not / save us, that love itself / was little more than a hook / for the mouth.” Set inside the force field of feminism, this issue’s most memorable tales by men also stress the chains that still bind us. René Char’s dream of a drowned child, admirably rendered by Nancy Naomi Carlson, tells a tale of womb-envy. And we also note that Daniele Del Giudice’s fable of buying time, translated by the dynamic duo of Liz Harris and Louise Rozier, concludes in a vision of women’s temporality first coined by Julia Kristeva. Martín Espada’s revelation of one of Roberto Clemente’s greatest moments, long confined by racist commentary to...",

Fortunately, more en lightened theorists, backed by empirical data and research have dispelled this very damaging myth. June, Maslow, Rogers and others offer more optimistic models of personality development which stress the individual’s striving towards self-fulfilment or self-actualisation. This is a process which begins later in life and is in fact more readily dealt with in old age when less energy is being expended on physical activity, making more available for this all important task of the psyche. Today the aged are known to respond well to various forms of psychotherapy.",

Furthermore, discrimination may influence its targets either directly (for instance, when housing discrimination makes insurance, mortgage rates, or rents higher for African Americans than for whites) or indirectly, that is via perceptions on the part of the stigmatised. In the latter case the outcomes are caused or amplified by perceptions on the part of the victim that he or she is the target of discrimination. This chapter focuses on current research concerning factors that influence the perception of discrimination and its indirect influence on individuals. We review work from our own lab as well as from the field more broadly, focusing on research that attempts to explain contextual and individual variability in how events that are potentially due to discrimination are initially perceived, subsequently interpreted, and then publicly reported or withheld.",

      "abstract": "The quotes are proved by unjust and inhumane action of killing in the name of false pride. Honour killings or crime against humanity has risen to prominence in recent years and is a global phenomenon. The punishments for cases obviously vary from society to society as per the nature and extent of the defiance and dishonour. Honour killing is the result of  socio-psychological milieu of cynical societies where some acts of the behavior of human beings especially of the females are recognized as making dishonour to their families and communities and the lost honour is recovered by killings them. Honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the perception of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community. The pseudo dishonour is generally the result of the unaccepted behaviors or the suspicion of such behaviors like desiring to terminate or prevent an arranged marriage or inter-caste marriage, inter-religion marriage, ‘sagotra’ marriage, desiring to marry by own choice or against the wishes of their family especially if to the member of a society deemed inappropriate, engaging in hetero-sexual acts outside marriage, adultery and engaging in homosexual acts etc. It is the menacing phenomena of repressive social practices in the name of honor triggering violent reaction from the influential members of community who are blind to individual autonomy. The ‘honour killings’ or ‘honour crimes’ are not peculiar to our country. It is an evil which haunts many other societies also and a global problem. Honour killings, for whatever reason needs immediate attention. Law needs to be used as a weapon to curb social evil. What is needed is a firm decision by the government for a separate law. There is paucity of research studies in this area. The networking of the police, judiciary, government, NGOs, human rights activists, sociologists, social workers, and psychologists is to be done in order to mitigate this social evil. Honour killing cannot be accepted in the name of culture or tradition. Honour killing is unjust and inhumane action. It is crime against mankind. The paper analyses the menace of honour killing, causes and legal framework.",

      "abstract": "Elevated social anxiety (SA) is linked to issues with emotional distress, substance use, and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Notwithstanding concerns of how sexuality has been defined in the extant literature, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of SA and related challenges may be disproportionately present among sexual minorities, including lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs). This trend may be especially relevant within the developmental context of emerging adulthood, an important period for development of sexual identity, and a time when individuals are already predisposed to heightened feelings of SA. The present study examined the relationship between sexual orientation (measured using sexual identity, sexual attraction, and past romantic and sexual behavior) and social anxiety (related to social interaction and social performance) among emerging adults. minority sexual identities [Welch's F(5,48.08) = 5.56, p = .002, ηp2 = .02.], same-sex attraction [Welch's F(4,108.06) = 11.27, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .04], and same-sex romantic [Welch's F(5,85.91) = 6.88, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .03] and sexual experiences[F(5,61.95) = 8.88, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .04], particularly among those who indicated attraction to multiple sexes. Findings support research that indicates that sexual minority adults experience higher levels of SA than majority (i.e., heterosexual, opposite-sex oriented) adults, and that assessment of sexuality may reflect number of sexual minorities identified. Future directions including intersections of race/ethnicity and gender are discussed.",

Method: A qualitative study based on a sample of 16 self-neglecting elders. Data collection was performed through in-depth semi-structured interviews, followed by content analysis. Findings: Four major themes emerged from the older participants: “I was unlucky:” a life course of suffering; “That's the way it is:” self-neglect as a routine of life; “They tell me that I'm disabled:” old age as exposing situations of self-neglect; “My empire:” how do I perceive my old age. Conclusions: Self-neglect is not necessarily an issue of old age, but is related to the person's life history. Self-neglect as a way of life accompanied the participants into old age, but it was not originated or created there. The overall message of the self-neglecting elders was to see them as human beings and not as old neglected people; not to label them as an “age syndrome” but to perceive them in a holistic and humanistic manner.",

Sexual boundary violations cast a long shadow over us: they generate horror, anxiety, curiosity, and sometimes excitement. Our need to deny what we know and to protect exalted mentors from scrutiny has led to a toxic collective silence; by and large, we have remained publicly silent while engaging in plenty of private gossip. Anxiety about the destructive consequences of \"telling\" further complicates our experience and can result in disavowal—a near-total foreclosure of the reality of the breach along with our experience of it. The author queries the dynamics driving our complex responses to sexual boundary violations and explores their collision with our professional ideal, using a personal experience to illustrate some of these issues.",

These activities are not only fun but also create a sense of fullness, self-love, self-satisfaction and joy in them, further combating issues like depression, anxiety and social isolation.

Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

      "title": "Emotionally and cognitively informed consent for clinical care for differences of sex development",
      "abstract": "Clinicians who utilise recommended best practices for informed consent may be surprised that families in support groups frequently report that some physicians continue to recommend certain irreversible treatments for children with differences of sex development (DSD) without adequate psychosocial support for cognitive processing of information necessary to decision-making. Such practice is contrary to recommendations in the 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders. When psychological preparation is lacking for aspects of DSD such as uncertainty about future gender identity, a false sense of urgency can propel parents to agree to genital surgery or removal of gonads without adequate understanding of the long-term consequences in adulthood. If physicians are uncomfortable discussing gender and sexual issues, they may not explore the feasibility of, or offer support for, alternative approaches towards sex atypicality. Families may draw unrealistic conclusions regarding the extent to which such interventions will relieve their distress and improve quality of life for the child and family. Failing to offer adequate psychosocial support to parents making irreversible decisions about DSD can raise significant ethical and legal concerns. Families may experience regret and anger when they make decisions on the basis of limited or even biased information while in an emotionally vulnerable state. Children's autonomy is violated when they are completely excluded from decision-making. We propose adoption of a holistic approach to emotionally and cognitively informed consent in this setting, with inclusion of psychosocial and peer support from the earliest stages.",

Father-absent subjects were not found to be more sexually permissive in reported likely behavior or attitude than father-present subjects. However, the father-absent group was found to have significantly greater inconsistency between behavioral and attitudinal scores in which the reported behavior was more permissive than the reported attitude. Finally, within the father-absent group, those subjects whose fathers became absent before they were five years old, were found to have a significantly higher need for social approval than subjects whose fathers became absent after they were five years old.

Two groups of subjects, singles and parents of two or more children, rated the similarity of 16fertility-status persons representative of parents, the voluntarily childless, and the involuntarily childless. Multidimensional scaling of the similarity judgments revealed two dimensions: the first related to likability, being loving, devoted, and emotionally mature; the other differentiated among fertility-status groups in terms of loneliness and happiness. The three fertility statuses were located in distinct quadrants in the space, with parents of two or more children being judged most favorably on the first dimension, followed by the involuntarily childless and then by parents of one child by choice and the voluntarily childless. On the second dimension, parents of two or more children, the voluntarily childless, and parents of one child by choice were perceived as less lonely and happier than the invollntarily childless. Sex of the stimulus person made little difference to location in the stimulus space. Single subjects and parents presented highly similar perceptions.",

      "abstract": "Kindermishandeling is een complex gegeven en is soms moeilijk met zekerheid vast te stellen. Het begrip kindermishandeling kent vele verschillende definities en deze worden steeds aangepast en verscherpt. Vaak worden zes categorieen onderscheiden: lichamelijke mishandeling, emotionele en psychische mishandeling, seksueel misbruik, verwaarlozing, institutionele mishandeling en structurele mishandeling. Kindermishandeling is multifactorieel bepaald en komt voor in alle socio-economische milieus. Kindermischandeling is moeilijk aan te tonen. Veel signalen kunnen erop wijzen, maar de aanwezigheid van die signalen betekent niet automatisch dat er sprake is van kindermishandeling. Kindermishandeling kan pas bestreden worden als de signalen herkend worden. Artsen, meer bepaald de huisarts en de kinderarts, hebben een cruciale rol bij de bestrijding ervan. Kindermishandeling kan ernstige gevolgen hebben op de emotionele en motorische ontwikkeling van het kind. Een adequaat en vroegtijdig ingrijpen bij vermoeden van kindermishandeling is essentieel. Nochtans melden artsen relatief weinig (vermoedens van) kindermishandeling. Er bestaat een wettelijk en deontologisch kader waarbinnen de arts kan functioneren, terwijl ook de consensus bestaat dat de arts in principe niet alleen te werk dient te gaan en zich best laat bijstaan door deskundige collega's en instanties.",

      "abstract": "Infertility, although not a life-threatening illness, is a life crisis that leads to medical, psychological, social and ethical issues. This article aims to investigate psychological, social and ethical dimensions of infertility, a major problem for women. Infertility can cause couples to have problems in a social and ethical sense besides its reactions such as depression, anxiety, loss and mourning. The societyâ€™s perspective of infertile couples can lead to emotional problems, sexual dysfunction and deterioration in marital relationships. Social and familial pressures for the continuity of the family line and physical, psychological and economic pressures of assisted reproductive techniques can adversely affect couples. Infertility is an unforeseen condition whose diagnosis takes a long time, causes excessive depression, stress and anxiety and weakens the adjustment mechanism. Infertility affects nearly 10-15% of couples of reproductive age. According to data released by the World Health Organization, it affects about 60-80 million people in the World. In conclusion, infertility is a major life crisis which brings about physical, psychological, social and ethical issues. Therefore, not only the assisted reproductive treatment of infertile couples but also their psychological, social and ethical situations should be considered. Couples undergoing treatment should also be provided counseling by health professionals as part of the routine treatment.",

As our laws pertaining to wills have not changed, and as the disease—so-called senile dementia—has not changed, why is that about nine in ten wills made by wealthy persons are subject to litigation, and the wealth earned by the testator, which was as much his own as his watch or his",

However, sharing this information with family members can be difficult, particularly in Zimbabwe where broader social and cultural forces pose significant challenges to 'coming out', and gender and/or sexuality diversity is strongly reacted against. This paper explores the experiences of gender and sexuality diverse persons in Harare as they came out to their families, or were 'outed' by others. The study involved semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, and focus group discussions with 31 gender and sexuality diverse individuals aged between 18-31 years. The participants revealed the different ways in which their families became aware of their sexual orientation. These pathways included planned disclosure, outing through extortion, blackmail, and other incidents. The narratives shared by participants varied significantly, encompassing a spectrum from overtly negative or positive responses to more complex reactions from families regarding their child or siblings' gender and sexuality diversity.",

The chapter also focuses on the aspects of sexual life directly linked to health; however, one should never forget that adolescents who are not sexually active are still sexual beings, and sexual experience and intercourse is just one aspect or dimension of sexuality among those teenagers who are sexually active. The development and acknowledgement of sexual orientation plays an important role in the formation of adult identity. Adolescents suffering from chronic diseases and/or disability often face difficulties in integrating a defective body within their sexual development.",

      "abstract": "people value fetuses and advocate protecting them because they are potential persons.1 However, granting rights to potential persons leads to unwelcome consequences when the principle of potentiality is extended to its logical conclusion. But devaluing potential persons also entails unpalatable consequences. The first outlook appears to leave its supporters protecting gametes from destruction. The logic of the second approach seems to permit the termination of fetuses in their thirty-sixth week and even the killing of infants because neither creatures in the womb nor newborns satisfy any of the most frequently suggested secular criteria for personhood. The problem of potentiality is thus we either end up condemning birth control and abstinence or we find ourselves condoning late abortion and infanticide. How to navigate between the Scylla and Charybdis of potentiality will be the concern of this paper. What I have labeled the stagnation thought will show that none of the familiar cutoff points for permissible abortions are morally significant. This thought experiment involves imagining that the conceptus stagnates, that is, stays alive but never develops any further.2 In other words, it loses its potential. Stagnating the conceptus at different times of development will reveal that any stage we initially thought to be intrinsically morally significant was only of importance because of the presence of the potential to develop further and acquire the genuinely valuable intrinsic trait(s) that normal children and adults possess. Despite the absence of a stage in which the fetus' development warrants moral legal protection, I will defend the idea that there should be a grace period at the beginning of pregnancy, perhaps as long as five or six months, in which a woman should be free to ponder her situation and choose an abortion if she so wishes. Two factors, neither sufficient by itself, must be present to allow a woman a grace period in which to choose to terminate a potential person.",

While commonly mentioned, the exact criteria a gay person uses when employing their gaydar are little discussed. Drawing methodologically on a series of five focus groups of self-identified lesbians and gay men, this study explores the physical, visual, energetic, and conversational cues gay people consider when they employ the trope of gaydar. Specifically, interview subjects most often described their gaydar as triggered by the following elements: physical presentation, including mannerisms, dress, and voice; interactions, especially eye contact; a presence or absence of certain conversational social norms; and, intangibly, as a kind of energetic exchange.",

      "abstract": "Sex on the rebound: Motivations for sex and sexual experiences following a relationship breakup.Despite widespread belief in the rebound phenomenon, few studies have examined sexual experiences after relationship loss, including what is popularly called being â€oeon the rebound.â€•The present study uses a longitudinal, online diary methodology to examine emotional and sexual responses to the loss of a romantic relationship among 170 undergraduate students who had experienced a recent breakup.Consistent with popular belief and previous research, individuals were more distressed and had lower self-esteem after a breakup, especially if they were â€oedumpedâ€• or had a higher quality or longer-lasting relationship, but these effects dissipated within 5-6 months post-breakup.Counter to belief, however, individuals were not more likely to have sex right after the breakup vs. later.However, when they did have sex it was often for unhealthy reasons, including to get over or get back at the ex-partner.Overall, although rebound sex was uncommon after a breakup, it still exists and is no less potentially harmful to those who engage in it.Not only does this study provide ground-breaking research on the motivational and behavioral consequences of a breakup, but it also highlights an important misconception about popular rebound lore.Specifically, although people appear to be vulnerable to poor sexual decision making in the aftermath of a breakup, as rebound lore suggests, actual occurrences of rebound sex appear relatively rare either because of lack of opportunity or experience, or because of restraint exercised at the individual level.",

      "title": "Wasting Time as a Cultural Practice in Contemporary Serbia",
      "abstract": "The expression \"wasting time\" is a colloquial label for periods of time spent waiting to receive services in various social situations in which people find themselves in state or private institutions, such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs or health institutions, banks and technical inspections of vehicles, etc. In this way, the superiority of social or cultural time over individual time is manifested. Cultural use of time represents the tendency to manage linear time by repeating events anchored in certain time segments, such as rituals, music festivals, sports events, or national holidays. Individuals perceive time based on cultural learning, understanding sociocultural time as a framework for organizing their personal time. This means that when they are not engaged in activities arising from collective time, individuals tend to organize their time according to their personal needs and intentions - as much as possible.Wasting time is therefore perceived as time not spent on activities related to work or free time that are the consequence of personal choice or existential necessity. The term most often refers to the waiting periods, which are apparently not regarded as integral to completing a task, such as a medical examination or obtaining personal documents. The concept of wasting time emerges as an uncreative, imposed, wasted time spent on completing tasks that could be organized differently. It is an empty time, devoid of important events and which is contrasted with periods of activity. The idea of ​​wasting time corresponds to the personal experience of time. The given expression is a consequence of evaluating whether or not a certain period of time was spent usefully, viewed from a personal perspective. Everyone's experience suggests that time seems to pass more slowly when we can do nothing but wait. The networking of such experiences, arising from a multitude of social situations that impose prolonged waiting as a procedural part to obtain what is considered useful or necessary for individuals, can be characterised as a cultural practice. The contributors to this practice include all social institutions that provide services to users through direct contact and hold a societal monopoly of performing their activities.",

But adults also apply such expressions to certain sociomoral transgressions, such as cheating on one's spouse or stealing from the poor. Here, the authors explore whether young children associate disgust with physical and moral events by endorsing either verbal or facial expressions of disgust. Results indicate that children in Grades K, 2, and 4 (N = 167) label moral violations \"disgusting\" more often than nondisgusting physical acts or neutral negative acts but less often than physically disgusting acts. Likewise, children associate facial expressions of disgust with moral violations. These findings are discussed in the context of different theories about the relationship between physical disgust and moral disgust.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The complexities of women's sexual response preclude useful management strategies which are modelled only on the traditional human sex response cycle beginning with sexual desire rather than other motivations. Both biological and psychological parameters affecting women's sexual motivation and arousability can be depicted in alternative models. These reflect that motivations to begin a sexual experience, although varied, are most often intimacy-based in women. The key role of subjective sexual arousal, which often precedes and then accompanies sexual desire, is clarified. A positive outcome emotionally and physically is necessary to achieve the original goal of enhancing emotional closeness, sense of being attracted and attractive, committed, loved—together with the goal (accessed en route) of sexual satisfaction. Innate, spontaneous desire may only occasionally augment the intimacy-based motivation. Thus therapy for 'desire disorders' may more profitably focus on the woman's problematic motivation, inadequate sexual stimuli and context, diminished arousability and/or unsatisfactory outcome to an experience. A model of subjective sexual arousal reflects the ongoing affective and cognitive modulation and variable input from physical genital congestion. Awareness of the poor correlation between genital vasocongestion and the subjective experience allows subtyping of arousal problems in order to facilitate their management.",

Esta ligazon tambien se ha demostrado en situaciones sociales relacionadas con la agresion interpersonal y que los seres humanos tienden a tomar decisiones mas agresivas en funcion del placer resultante. El objetivo de este estudio fue comprobar si esta tendencia se observa tambien en reclusos. Los resultados son similares a los observados en sujetos “normales” si bien el grado de hedonismo es mas alto en los reclusos. No se encontraron diferencias de edad ni sexo. Concluimos que cuanto mas agresiva es la conducta mas placentera es para el agresor, con la excepcion de los niveles mas elevados de agresividad. Esta tendencia se observa tanto en sujetos “normales” como en reclusos, aunque es mas fuerte en estos ultimos.[ABSTRACT]Maximization of pleasure (hedonicity) is a major mechanism in human decision-making, as previous research on both hoth sensory pleasure and purely mental pleasure. In addiction, it has also documented that pleasure is a major factor in decision-making in social situations related to interpersonal aggression, and that people tend to make aggressive behavioural decisions as a function of the resulting pleasure. The present study tried to verify whether this trend was also found in inmates. The results were similar to the ones previously observed in ‘normal’ subjects, even though the degree of hedonicity was higher in the prisoners. No sex nor age differences were found. We conclude that increasingly aggressive behavior is increasingly pleasurable to the aggressor, whith the exception of the highest levels of aggression. This trend is found in both ‘normal’ and inmate populations, even if it seems to be stronger in prisoners.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse and assault can be characterized by an individual committing a sexual act against other individuals who are too young to consent. Sexual acts could range from verbal sexual harassment, to sexual organs being fondled, to penetration (oral or genital), and other sexual acts. Perpetrators stem from heterogeneous populations and can be related to their victims, known by their victims or, more rarely, strangers to their victims. Victims of sexual abuse can suffer short-term and long term adverse consequences on different levels. In many, mostly western, societies the occurrence of child sexual abuse is regarded as a traumatic experience for the victims on an individual level and as a problem of the corresponding society on a macro-societal level. One (Western) response to the problem has been the development of group-based empowerment prevention programmes which are seen as cost cutting and cost-effective. Still, many critiques view the empowerment model is ineffective and dangerous for children at the same time. Some critiques are outlined here and suggestions are made for further preventive directions in child protection.",

For eleven- to thirteen-year-olds, however, a significant relationship between animism and both cognitive style and classification ability existed.

Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists. Here, boys are stratified in accordance to a popularity ranking, which is determined by the possession of a matrix of variables: Namely, charisma, authenticity, emotional support, and social fluidity.",

Each of these decisions is, of course, shaped by outside forces such as school, family, and peer groups. However, perhaps the most difficult of these decisions are made with some of the least discussion, and are met with the most severe consequences. These are the decisions of body, sexuality, and sex. Most teenagers are faced with making sexual decisions in a vortex of misinformation, excitement, stigma, and fear. Society frowns upon teen sexuality, often meeting sexual discussion with avoidance or condemnation. Teens are not supposed to talk about sex; or if they talk about it, they are not supposed to have it; but if they have it, they are not supposed to do it outside of socially and morally acceptable standards. At a fundamental level, we as a society do not provide teens with complete information about sex and their bodies. We expect them to make choices without the necessary information, and the choices they make are often punished, in a framework of legal, social, and familial responsibility.",

The article involved a thematic analysis of 117 cases, identified from nine services that work with children with sexual behaviour problems. While a number of young people were from stable backgrounds, others were from highly disrupted sociological situations characterised by chaotic families, erratic living situations, poor family relationships, unstable parental backgrounds, generalised neglect and abuse, sexual abuse and school/social problems. Many of these young people's lives appear to be characterised by varying degrees of liminality and chaos. Such chaos may not only be traumatic, it may potentially be traumagenic, and contribute to the emergence of sexual behaviour problems in some young people.",

The higher rates of mental illness among women can be linked to aspects of their societal role and particularly to aspects of the marital role. Therapists who treat women whose mental illness is in part a response to the characteristics of conventional sex roles have no treatment alternatives that are not in some way problematic. The treatment alternative chosen has, in the broadest sense, political implications for the society at large.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders (ED) are characterized by severe disturbances in eating behavior, which may result in biological, psychological and social prejudices.Prevalence is significantly higher in female gender and symptoms start mainly during adolescence, coinciding with the psychosocial transition that marks this stage of vital cycle and the intensification of sexual experiences.From the perspective of psychoanalysis, ED can be understood as somatic responses to emotional tension triggered by mental processes that could not be symbolized.This difficulty of symbolization seems to be related to the adolescent's impossibility to individuate, which would require an adult´s woman body and mind.Psychic fusion and the resulting anxiety from separation of the mother figure is also related to the unconscious representations of femininity: the eruption of sexuality in adolescence leads the girl to grieve for her child body, and also her child's parents, which are being left behind.Starting from the premise that the symptom of food refusal may be regarded as an unconscious defense used to obliterate the process of separation-individuation, which is an inherent part of emotional development, the present study aimed to investigate the development of sexuality and femininity in women who developed ED, from the perspective of patients, their mothers and their fathers, seeking to establish links between these fundamental aspects of subjective constitution and the symptoms that characterize the psychopathological condition.It is a collective case study, descriptive and cross-sectional, with qualitative approach.Participants were female adolescents and young adults with ED, linked to the Group of Assistance on Eating Disorders (GRATA), from the Clinics Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo (HC-FMRP -USP), and their parents (parental couple, interviewed separately), totalizing seven oedipal triads.The instruments used for data collection were: semi-structured interviews, applied individually with each member of the triad consisting of daughter-mother-father; field diary, prepared by the researcher during data collection; and Brazilian Economic Classification Criterion/2015.Interviews were audiorecorded for later transcription and thematic analysis.Data was be interpreted with the support of the theoretical framework of Joyce McDougall´s psychoanalytic psychosomatic.Results showed that the triads´ psychic dynamic included mother-daughter fusion, and father´s detachment.Mothers and daughters perceived femininity as equivalent to vulnerability and source of distress.Fathers were frightened by their daughters´ femininity, which made them distance themselves.Daughters´ difficulties regarding reaching genitality was evident, and was associated with difficulties of individuation and separation from the parents from childhood.This study provides input into clinical practice with regard to the relationship between the experiences related to sexuality/femininity and symptoms of ED, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological aspects related to sexuality by the professionals involved in care, prevention and health promotion in adolescence.",

There are confusing messages about the extent to which teachers (and headteachers) are expected to be moral exemplars and role models. Heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, transsexuals and transvestites – any of whom could be practising or celibate – will be found amongst teachers (and headteachers), as in the rest of the population. Most of the time the sexuality and sexual behaviour of teachers and headteachers will have nothing to do with the institution in which they work, but on occasions this distinction may not prevail.

However, research on masculinities notes scripts are changing and providing mixed messages regarding the expression of sexualities for heterosexual men. Given this, we look closely at sexual scripts in initiation of sexual intimacy as a means of exploring transformation in sexualities and understanding men’s interpersonal/intrapsychic narratives as expressions of masculinities. Based on in-depth interviews with sixty-nine heterosexual men, ages twenty to fifty-nine, we found that interviewees recounted feelings of readiness and desire for sex as boys and young men. We also found that though, as boys and young men, interviewees felt ready for and desired sex, yet in first experiences, they shared they were anxious and usually waited for partners to initiate or for clear clues partners were ready. Men’s accounts reflect concerns with sexual performance and the incongruence of sexual scripts at the cultural and interpersonal/intrapsychic levels, as well as a private expression of masculinity, reserved for situations with intimate partners.",

A quantitative synthesis of published research showed, however, that the sex difference is age specific. There is little sex difference in either childhood or advanced old age, but a notable sex difference in middle life. This sex difference appears because rates for females rise sharply from childhood to adulthood and then decline somewhat in old age. By contrast, rates for males show a small rise in early adulthood but are otherwise fairly stable throughout life. The age-specific nature of these sex differences may be explainable in terms of differences in social roles at various ages.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Twenty‐six gay, 24 lesbian, and 49 heterosexual (19 male and 30 female) individuals who were separated from their relationship partner for about 6 months provided reasons why their relationship ended and rated their current separation distress. Relative to partners in heterosexual couples, those in gay or lesbian couples did not differ in reasons for the separation or in level of separation distress. Aspects of relationship quality assessed shortly before the separation occurred did not predict later separation distress. However, individuals who indicated that problems with intimacy were the cause of the separation were unlikely to be distressed by the separation, whereas individuals who indicated that problems with communication were the cause of the separation were likely to be distressed by the separation. Separation distress was positively related to the severity of neurotic symptoms reported when the relationship was intact and was negatively related to the extent to which the separation was expected. It is concluded that separation distress is more strongly related to personal strategies for coping with stress than to relationship‐related events leading to separation.",

The chapter argues that the theoretical traditions which have shaped the field of CSA disclosure – and particularly theories that seek to explain non-disclosure – are firmly rooted in an understanding of sexual abuse as something occurring to younger children within the family. Child-related barriers are those which arise from developmental characteristics of the child and/or emotional turmoil experienced by the child as a result of the abuse. Relational barriers are those which arise from the nature or characteristics of a relationship or set of relationships which can be actual or perceived. Social barriers are those which arise from broader societal responses to or messages about sexual abuse that may prevent disclosure.",

Bu bölümde, yaşlılık döneminde cinsel işlev bozukluklarının ortaya çıkmasına katkı sağlayan durumlar ve yaşlı ile çalışan sağlık profesyonellerinin dikkat etmesi gerekenlerden bahsedilmektedir. Cinsel işlev bozuklukları, bireylerin cinsel uyaranlara gösterdiği fizyolojik yanıt tepkilerinden birinde veya birkaçında ortaya çıkan ve bireylerin cinsel olarak yanıt verme veya cinsel zev- ki deneyimleme yeteneğinde önemli sıkıntılara yol açan bir durumdur. Dünya genelinde, cin- sel işlev bozuklukları kadınlarda %22-46 arasında görülürken erkeklerde %31-39 arasında görülmektedir. Kadınlarda en sık rastlanan cinsel işlev bozukluğu cinsel ilgi/uyarılma bozuk- luğu iken, erkeklerde erken boşalmadır. Bu bozuklukların yaş ile birlikte daha da fazla arttığı bilinmektedir. Yaşlı kadınlarda, menopoz dönemiyle birlikte östrojenin vücuttan çekilmesinden dolayı vajinal sekresyonlarda azalma, disparoni, vajina boyunun kısalması, idrar kaçırma gibi sorunlar yaşamaktadır. Bu sorunlar kadınların cinsel aktiviteden kaçınmalarına yol açar. Bunun yanı sıra bazı kadınlar menopozun üreme yeteneğinin kaybına neden olan bir dönüm noktası olarak tanımlamakla birlikte bu noktadan sonra cinselliğin normal olmayacağını düşünmekte- dirler. Erkeklerde ise testosteron düzeylerinde düşme ile birlikte sertleşme sorunları ve cinsel istek azlığı yaşanmasına rağmen erkeklerde kadınlara göre cinsel işlevlerde ani bir şekilde du- rum değişikliği olmamaktadır. Bu bağlamda, yaşlı bireylere bakım veren sağlık profesyoneller- in bireylerin yaşla birlikte bazı fonksiyonlarında değişimler olacağı ile ilgili bilgilendirilmesi ve bu değişimlerin fizyolojik bir süreç olduğu belirtilmesi ortaya çıkacak cinsel işlev bozuklarının azaltacaktır. Ayrıca bu dönemde yaşlı çiftlere verilecek olan cinsel terapi ile bireylerin mevcut durumundaki cinsel kapasitesinin kabulü sağlanıp toplumsal ön yargılardan uzak ve herhangi bir başarısızlıkla ilgili suçluluk hissetmeden cinsel işlevlerine devam edilmesine katkı sağlaya- caktır. Sonuç olarak sağlık profesyone lleri tarafından yaşlılık döneminde cinsel işlevler hakkında daha fazla hizmet sağlanmalı ve bu cinsel işlev bozukluğu yaşayan kişilere ulaşılmalıdır.",

      "title": "Deviance, Normative Definitions of",
      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake &amp; Kingsley 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviance is a formal violation of the rules.",

      "title": "“No more a child, not yet an adult”: studying social cognition in adolescence",
      "abstract": "There are several reasons why adolescence is interesting. It is in this phase that an individual finds herself fully facing the external world: basically equipped with the kind of social cognition that s/he has acquired at home, at school and through the media during childhood, s/he has now to meet a host of other, diverse views of what \"reasonable\", \"appropriate\" or \"expected\" courses of thought and emotions are, in the wild with friends and peers, romantic or sexual partners, teachers and employers, and the society at large. Furthermore, she is also expected, both at home and in the external world, to have a wholly new degree of control over such courses. While the idea that the development of social cognition still progresses after infancy (and possibly throughout the life span) is clearly gaining consensus in the field, the literature building on it is still scarce. One of the reasons for this probably is that most tests used to study it focus on its basic component, namely ToM, and have been mostly devised for us with children; therefore, they are not suitable to deal with the hugely increasing complexity of social and mental life during adolescence and adulthood. Starting from a review of the literatuer available, we will argue that the development of social cognition should be viewed as a largely yet-to-be-understood mix of biological and cultural factors. While it is widely agreed upon that the very initial manifestations of social life in the newborn are largely driven by an innate engine with which all humans are equally endowed, it is also evident that each culture, and each individual within it, develops specific adult versions of social cognition.",

Sexual advances made by one’s partner were associated with increased sexual satisfaction that day and for up to 72 hours later, regardless of whether the advance was accepted or rejected.

We examined risk factors involved with disclosure to posit how sex education might diffuse stigma and warn of risks. Semi-structured interviews asked 20 adults reporting an interest in BDSM about their disclosure experiences. Most respondents reported their BDSM interests starting before age 15, sometimes creating a phase of anxiety and shame in the absence of reassuring information. As adults, respondents often considered BDSM central to their sexuality, thus disclosure was integral to dating. Disclosure decisions in nondating situations were often complex considerations balancing desire for appropriateness with a desire for connection and honesty. Some respondents wondered whether their interests being found out would jeopardize their jobs. Experiences with stigma varied widely.",

      "abstract": "Recent changes in societal attitudes toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual identities have resulted in more people openly identifying with sexual minority status. Due to research on the effects of denying one's sexual orientation and the negative effects of this, many have advocated for more openness in queer sexual orientation. Compassion means connecting to the suffering of others not by avoiding their pain but instead by identifying it so that the feeling of kindness may emerge. Self-compassion, therefore, involves being touched by and open to one's own suffering, not avoiding or disconnecting from it, generating the desire to alleviate one's suffering and to heal oneself with kindness. The purpose of the research is to understand the impact that being out has on a queer person's self-compassion. The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) is a 26-item, 5-point Likert measure, where a higher score equated to higher self-compassion and looked at how a person showed loving kindness to one's self through the six dimensions of self-compassion. The six dimensions of self-compassion are mindfulness, over-identification, self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, and isolation. Results showed that those who are totally out have a higher sense of self-compassion. Implications for practitioners working with the queer population are also discussed.",

Jopa hetkellinen ostrakismi satuttaa, ja pitkittyessään hyljeksintä voi johtaa syrjäytymiseen, mielenterveysongelmiin ja joskus jopa väkivallantekoihin. Ilmiöllä on siis huomattava merkitys niin yksilön kuin yhteiskunnankin kannalta. Ostrakismitutkimus auttaa hahmottamaan monien ilmiöiden, kuten koulukiusaamisen, rasistisen syrjinnän ja avioeron, vaikutuksia yksilöön. Ostrakismiin liittyviä kokeellisia tutkimuksia on julkaistu maailmalla satoja, mutta Suomessa tämä tutkimus lienee verrattain tuntematonta. Tämän katsausartikkelin tarkoitus on tuoda esille tätä tutkimusta. Esittelemme lukijalle ostrakismia ilmiönä ja avaamme joitakin keskeisiä kokeellisen ostrakismitutkimuksen menetelmiä, tuloksia ja teorioita. Artikkelin lopussa paneudumme erityiseen mielenkiinnon kohteeseemme: siihen, miten hyljeksityksi tuleminen muuttaa ihmisen sosiaalista havaitsemista ja sosiaalisesti merkityksellisen informaation prosessointia ja tulkintaa.",

      "abstract": "The initial question that nervous parents ask when they attend their first routine scan during pregnancy is usually ‘is it a boy or a girl?’ We attribute major significance to the sex of our offspring, and throughout their lives these males and females will forever be labelled accordingly, and provided with numerous ‘rules’ from various societal, legal and religious sources, that will govern their interactions with one another. It is not surprising then that one of the key questions that has enthralled behavioural endocrinologists and social scientists, in almost equal amounts, concerns that of sexual determination/differentiation – how genes initially determine sex, and then how a variety of factors (principally hormonal) cause the sexes to differentiate in terms of their morphology, physiology and, most controversially perhaps, behaviour and psychology. From a psychological perspective, the study of such sexual differentiation in relation to cognition, personality, mood, etc. has formed major research topics that even now are dogged by controversy, hyperbole and downright sensationalism.",

      "abstract": "A nascent body of research is growing on the issue of disclosing one’s sexuality, also termed “coming out,” and the implications for attitudes, behavior, and health. This research engages (a) the political attitudes of those reporting their sexual identity, and (b) the social conditions that lead people to express different forms of sexual identity. Four main findings help to characterize the relationship between coming out and political attitudes among sexual minorities. First, people who come out tend to be socially liberal, but the reasons behind this pattern remain unclear. Second, tolerant social conditions correlate with coming out; expressions of tolerant attitudes; and political engagement on behalf of lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights. Third, the reverse holds as well: Intolerant, homophobic social conditions correlate with the concealment of one’s homosexuality and the expression of homophobic attitudes. Fourth, homophobic social conditions also may lead to worse mental health outcomes, which in turn reduce political efficacy and participation. However, the causal relationships between social conditions, coming out, political outcomes, and health outcomes elude existing research. Future research can unpack these relationships and include more cases outside Western Europe and North America, where most research on this topic is conducted.",

Pictured above the caption is an older couple, strolling hand-in-hand on a beach, who have discovered that firn begins after reproduction ends. Aging as a liberator counters the myth that being old means being sick and sexless. However, the idea of sexual activity as lifelong is contrary to the thinking of some older persons, their children, and their physicians. As a result, older adults may be reluctant to admit romantic aspirations; their children may resent a widowed parent's dating; and physicians may not inquire about an elderly patient's sexual history or health for fear of embarrassing the patient. Nonetheless, old age can be looked upon as a period not devoid of sexual pleasures, though myths regarding sex late in life persist [1]. Clinicians who lack an awareness of these myths will find it difficult to treat sexual problems in the elderly.",

Using self-reported dyadic sexual desire relating to a partner, dyadic sexual desire relating to an attractive person, and solitary sexual desire from a large (N &amp;gt; 8000) and age-diverse (14.6 - 80.2 years) online sample, the current study had three goals: First, we investigated relationships between men and women’s sexual desire and age. Second, we examined whether individual differences such as gender/sex, sexual orientation, self-rated masculinity, relationship status, self-rated attractiveness, and self-rated health predict sexual desire. Third, we examined how these associations differed across sexual desire facets. On average, the associations between age and both men and women’s sexual desire followed non-linear trends and differed between genders/sexes and types of sexual desire. Average levels of all types of sexual desire were generally higher in men. Dyadic sexual desire related positively to self-rated masculinity and having a romantic partner and solitary desire was higher in people with same-sex attraction. We discuss the results in the context of the evolutionary hypothesis that predict an increase of sexual desire and female reproductive effort prior to declining fertility. Our findings both support and challenge beliefs about gender/sex specificity of age effects on sexual desire and highlight the importance of differentiating between desire types.",

Here, we review recent cross-cultural, nonclinical research that suggests elevated childhood separation anxiety is simply a component of the more general pattern of femininity exhibited by pre-androphilic males (i.e., biological males who are sexually attracted to adult males in adulthood). Whereas clinical perspectives have tended to characterize the co-occurrence of femininity and elevated childhood separation anxiety as psychopathological, we propose an alternate perspective that views this co-occurrence as having a prosocial basis. Specifically, we argue that elevated childhood separation anxiety is a developmental precursor of cognitive biases that evolved to facilitate increased kin-directed altruism in androphilic males. We also detail findings concerning personality and behavioral characteristics of male androphiles that are consistent with this evolutionarily minded perspective. Possible clinical implications that arise from this evolutionarily minded perspective are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "No national consensus exists concerning adolescent capacity to consent to sex. The law gives differing legal significance to adolescent consent to teen-adult sex depending upon a variety of factors. In response to an increase in teen sexual harassment cases, this Article examines three subject areas that should inform the debate over the actual meaning of adolescent consent: adolescent development, adolescent sexuality, and child/adolescent sexual abuse. First, new neuroscientific and psychosocial science data suggest that adolescent physical and psychosocial development continue into the third decade of life. Studies reveal that adolescents' activities influence their physical brain development and growth. In other words, adolescents hard-wire their experiences into their brains. Second, statistics regarding adolescent sexuality indicate that teens are having sex that is not always completely voluntary. Moreover, parents are often unaware that their children are having sex. Finally, evidence demonstrates that child sexual abuse can permanently and physically disable youth. This Article suggests that the new scientific and statistical evidence should prompt law reform pertaining to teen capacity and consent. It concludes that while adolescents need to exercise their decision-making skills as they mature, they still need protection from adult sexual predators. As the Supreme Court's recent decision in Roper v. Simmons suggests, we should not presume full capacity where science indicates adolescents are immature and still developing capacity. This Article recommends, in particular, that sexual harassment law should be revised to make teen consent to workplace sex with an adult supervisor voidable by the minor. Courts should find teen-adult sex unwelcome as a matter of law, when the minor alleges sexual harassment. This Article recommends a strict liability civil response to teen sexual harassment, whether or not the teenager once consented to sex with the adult supervisor.",

The second hypothesis was also supported: For girls only, activity was significantly related to peer rejection during Year 1 only, the time when high-activity girls also interacted frequently with boys.

The Relationships of Parental Expectations and Preschool Children's Verbal Sex Typing to Their Sex-typed Toy Play Behavior. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1980, 51, 266-270. Parents of 52 preschool-age children predicted how frequently their children would play with each of 12 adultdefined sex-typed and neutral toys. Each child played 10 min with the toys; 32 of the children verbally rated the toys as to sex appropriateness. Children sex-typed the toy groups in the expected cultural directions but with lower agreement than adults; younger children assigned fewer toys exclusively to the opposite sex than did older children. Girls played longer with neutral and equally long with feminine and masculine toys; boys played longer with masculine and equally long with feminine and neutral toys. With increasing age, both sexes played longer with feminine toys; no age differences were found for masculine and neutral toys. The children were highly concordant in their verbal sex typing and play; younger children played with a smaller proportion of self-defined sex-inappropriate toys, but there were no age differences in proportion of playtime spent with these toys. Parents expected their children to play with culturally defined sex-appropriate toys, but in general their predictions were not accurate.",

      "abstract": "Evidenciar que en Guatemala se ha ejercido una homofobia generalizada que ha provoca el estigma y discriminacion a los homosexuales masculinos. El sistema hetero – patriarcal transmitido de generacion en generacion dentro del ambito familiar, contribuye en la prevalencia de actitudes, conductas, comportamientos y conocimientos que no permiten aceptar la diversidad sexual de los individuos (homosexuales, bisexuales, otros). De esta forma se han generalizado fenomenos especificos tales como: la represion, la disfuncionalidad familiar, el machismo, la homofobia y la misoginia. En el ambito religioso consideran a la homosexualidad como un pecado y una practica antinatural, bajo la creencia que la sexualidad es especialmente para la reproduccion y procreacion. Anulando el placer mutuo; en lo laboral las empresas publicas y privadas buscan una imagen corporativa con caracteristicas fisicas como hombre (masculino) o mujer (femenino), considerando un desprestigio para la misma, tener personal homosexual; debido a esto y a otros factores una persona homosexual es constantemente menospreciada, objeto de burla, tema de comentario, descalificacion y muchas veces son directamente maltratados fisica y psicologicamente, a la vez ha generado el desempleo masivo en homosexuales. En el ambito politico se discrimina a la poblacion homosexual al no establecer leyes que rijan derechos y obligaciones que protejan la integridad y dignidad de las personas homosexuales como todo ser humano. Dentro del ambito educativo la poblacion homosexual es considerada como influencia negativa en la formacion de los ninos y ninas, porque la sociedad cree que los menores que se relacionan con personas homosexuales pueden ser victimas de acoso, abuso y/o violacion sexual por la poblacion homosexual. Es por ello que los homosexuales son victimas de discriminacion y estigma social, a corto, mediano y/o largo plazo desencadena trastornos psicologicos y sentimientos de inseguridad, que afectan significativamente la salud integral de los mismos.",

The first and the last of these phases are characterized by cycles of acceleration followed by deceleration in growth rates, both are accompanied with striking developmental changes. The middle phase, in contrast, is one of relatively steady, moderate progress in both growth and maturation. The term adolescence refers rather loosely to the last of these three major phases, to the time during which the child becomes a man or woman. The earliest and latest changes of this transformation take place insidiously and are not easily recognized or defined. They reach back well into what is usually thought of as childhood, or the stable middle period of growth, and they extend forward into what is, in most respects, adulthood. The major changes of adolescence, however, take place within a much shorter period and are recognized more",

      "title": "Anxiety increases sexual arousal.",
      "abstract": "Twelve male subjects who were trained to expect tolerance-level electric shocks viewed an erotic film under three different counterbalanced conditions. In one condition, subjects viewed erotic film in conjunction with a signal light indicating threat of shock. A second light indicated threat of shock if subjects did not achieve an erection of a certain size. A third light indicated no shock. Both anxiety-inducing shock-threat conditions increased penile response over and above np-shock-threat condition. Furthermore, shock threat contingent on size of erection produced more arousal than noncontingent-shock threat. There is an almost universal assumption that primary maintaining factor in male sexual dysfunction is anxiety, specifically, performance anxiety or fear of performance, and modal treatments employed have as a major goal reduction of this anxiety. Masters and Johnson (1970) note a number of initial etiological pathways to erectile dysfunction, such as alcohol abuse and unfortunate, early traumatic sexual experiences; but, in regard to subsequent maintaining factors, they observe that the prevalent roadblock is one of fear. Fear can prevent erections just as fear can increase respiratory rate or lead to diarrhea or vomiting (p. 196). Unfortunately, this is an assumption without evidence in either dysfunctional or normal subjects, an assumption that goes beyond careful observations that Masters and Johnson and other clinicians have made when dealing with sexual dysfunction. The few attempts to examine relationship between anxiety and sexual arousal have been puzzling. In 1977, Hoon, Wincze, and Hoon showed 2-minute film sequences that were either neutral in content or that were designed to produce anxiety (vivid scenes of auto' accidents) to normal women, These",

Seventy‐two individuals were presented with written descriptions of an elderly person who did or did not have control over relocation to a family member's home or an institution. It was predicted and found that subjects did not hold negative attitudes to aging per se but such attitudes were influenced by negative environmental conditions (un controllability and institutionalization) associated with aging and which have been found to actually promote physical and psychological decline. Negative attitudes toward aging may not merely reflect the aging process, but may be determinants of both the experience of aging and general attitudes toward the aged.",

      "title": "Why boys will be boys and girls will be girls: Human sex development and its defects",
      "abstract": "Among the most defining events of an individual's life, is the development of a human embryo into male or a female. The phenotypic sex of an individual depends on the type of gonad that develops in the embryo, a process which itself is determined by the genetic setting of the individual. The development of the gonads is different from any other organ, as they possess the potential to differentiate into two functionally distinct organs, testes, or ovaries. Sex development can be divided into two distinctive processes, \"sex determination,\" which is the commitment of the undifferentiated gonad into either a testis or an ovary, a process that is genetically programmed in a critically timed manner and \"sex differentiation,\" which takes place through hormones produced by the gonads, once the developmental sex determination decision has been made. Disruption of any of the genes involved in either the testicular or ovarian development pathway could lead to disorders of sex development. In this review, we provide an insight into the factors important for sex determination, their antagonistic actions and whenever possible, references on the \"prismatic\" clinical cases are given.

      "abstract": "Previous research has shown that the early learning of male–female categories is characterized by rigid beliefs about stereotypic differences, but that once gender knowledge is well established, the beliefs become more flexible. Because most studies are cross-sectional, it is not known if the early rigidity represents a normative transitional developmental stage that passes, or if early individual differences in rigidity continue into later childhood. To answer that question, analyses were performed on longitudinal data of 64 children who had been questioned about their gender concepts yearly from ages 5 to 10 years. Supporting a cognitive-developmental approach, the findings showed that the period of rigidity was short-lived whether rigidity began early or late or whether the level of peak rigidity was high or low.

Thus the minimal generation time is about 20 months for a marmoset smaller than a laboratory rat, 4 years for a typical Old World monkey the size of a dog, perhaps 10 or 12 years for a great ape. Nor does maturation cease with sexual maturity: increasingly, it is ber:oming clear that interaction patterns, the role, of adult primates of either sex continues to change for many years (e.g. Sackett and Ruppenthal 1973). This is not necessarily a peculiarity of primates, however; social maturation probably continues beyond sexual maturity in other social mammals. We can, of course, make cross-sectional descriptions of social development, obtaining means and ranges of such measures as time spent in contact with mother, or frequency of maternal intervention in interactions between infants and others at particular ages. This method can be extended relatively easily to infants develop-",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this chapter is to offer an evolutionarily framed overview of human male reproductive health. The chapter is situated within key themes of the overall volume: the relevance of evolutionary and life history theory; sex differences in reproductive effort and their relevance to lifespan and health; the complementary distinctions between proximate and ultimate causation; the importance of context; and the consistent relevance of senescence for understanding aspects of male reproductive health. The structure of the chapter features precopulatory, copulatory, and postcopulatory sections, with key concepts and illustrations presented. The precopulatory section highlights male reproductive health consequences of intrasexual selection, courtship, and sexual coercion. These consequences include male injuries, death, and concerns over status and secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle that have shaped ancestral, if not also contemporary, reproductive success. The copulatory section covers sexual desire, erectile function, semen parameters, genetic parameters, and sexual satisfaction. Patterns in these aspects of male reproductive health commonly vary with age, health status, and partnership dynamics. Other facets of postcopulatory male reproductive health include reproductive constraints (e.g., contraception), sexually transmitted infections, and prostate cancer. Postcopulatory reproductive health touches on key domains such as partnership and sexual dynamics, metabolic consequences (e.g., physical activity and body composition), mental health (e.g., depression), and neuoroendocrine mechanisms (e.g., brain activity and hormone differences associated with paternal care). The scope of this review encompasses key concerns (e.g., erectile dysfunction, testosterone treatment, infertility) of biomedical approaches to male reproductive health while also expanding the scope to include more precopulatory and postcopulatory aspects, all framed within an overarching evolutionary and life history perspective.",

      "title": "L’évaluation de la capacité de consentement sexuel chez les personnes âgées souffrant de démence : quelle place et quels outils pour les psychologues ?",
      "abstract": "Résumé Les capacités décisionnelles des personnes âgées présentant une démence comptent parmi les problématiques sociétales et éthiques les plus importantes dans le champ du vieillissement. La question est particulièrement épineuse lorsqu'il s'agit d'aborder la capacité de consentement sexuel chez ces personnes. En effet, des travaux montrent que les personnes âgées institutionnalisées (atteintes ou non de démences) conservent des intérêts et besoins sexuels similaires à ceux des personnes âgées vivant à domicile. Néanmoins, les personnes âgées cognitivement ou physiquement vulnérables constituent également un groupe à risque d'agressions et/ou de victimisation sexuelles, en particulier celles atteintes de démence sévère. Cet article s'intéresse à la place du psychologue et à la démarche qu'il peut développer pour évaluer la capacité de consentement sexuel chez le sujet âgé présentant une vulnérabilité cognitive. Abstract Decision-making capacities of older people with cognitive disorders are among the most important societal and ethical issues in the field of aging. The question is particularly thorny when it comes to addressing the issue of sexual consent capacity among these people. Indeed, research shows that institutionalized elderly people (with or without dementia) maintains sexual interests and needs similar to those of elderly people living at home. Nevertheless, cognitively or physically vulnerable elderly people also constitute a group at risk of sexual assault and/or victimization, and especially with people with severe dementia. This article examines the place of the psychologist and the approach he can develop to assess the capacity of sexual consent in the elderly subject with cognitive vulnerability. Following the recommendations of the American Bar Association/American Psychological Association for the assessment of capacity in older adults with diminished capacity, we make some propositions to assess psychological and neuropsychological functions implicated in sexual consent.",

Those wanting to remain childless were in favor of delaying marriage. This group and the group wanting a career 1st both saw career as more important than did the 3rd group. Those desiring no children reported more stereotypically male traits and less female ones but did not see their careers as more important than the group wanting to establish a career then have children. In other words career was not the substitute for children as a source of satisfaction. Voluntarily childless women scored higher on dependence and other traits deviating from the female norm. This supports a hypothesis that those with more traditionally male traits will be more inclined toward goals of success dominance aggressivity and independence. Achievement scores were fairly equal among the 3 groups. Those wanting to delay childbearing did not score higher on dominant traits nor lower on socioemotional traits than those not delaying children. These findings support a personality predisposition toward childlessness.",

Nowadays, there have been many sexual behavior deviations done by the teenagers such as holding hands with the opposite sex, embracing, kissing, and even having intercourse like a husband and wife. Sexual behavior deviations are caused by internal and external factors. Internal factors can occur due to the sexual arousal that occurs in the age of adolescence and want to channel it to the opposite sex, while external factors can occur due to the environment that makes adolescents commit sexual behavior irregularities, as there are pornographic sites seen by teenagers, then they demonstrate with the opposite sex and lack the education. The purpose of this research is to look at the adolescent perception relationship about the maturity of reproductive tools with sexual behavior deviations. This study uses propotional stratiefied random sampling techniques. Based on research done, it was found that there was a significant link between juvenile perception of the maturity of reproductive tools and sexual behavior deviations.",

      "abstract": "Sex and sexuality are contentious concepts, blending the deeply personal with the profoundly political. They concern most of us in our private spaces of fantasy and meaning, relationships and families, pleasure and pain, creation and loss. But sex and sexuality are not solely private matters; with conceptual boundaries moving and being transgressed, they have increasingly been brought into public life and contested in the courts.1 Should we press on with this use of the law, or not? This special issue of the Medical Law Review looks at cutting-edge medical and legal aspects of sex and sexuality. Sex, a biological classification of human, other mammalian, and non-mammalian bodies, has extensive sociopolitical and cultural baggage beyond its putative function of referring to (and drawing divisions on the basis of) clusters of reproduction-related bodily features. Sexuality, by which we mean the whole landscape of one’s sexual desires and activities, has also been decoupled from reproduction in various ways over the last half-century or more. Section II offers an explanation of the biological territory on which current arguments and future legal cases may be fought (and can be skipped by those with a detailed understanding of the science already). Section III considers regulation. In Section IV, we explain some difficult choices facing us as a society and the interaction of the various articles in this issue.",

The likelihood of a highly able child being called a prodigy partly depends upon whether or not the individual's abilities are readily apparent to other people. By no means all outstanding adults were prodigies as children. Biographical accounts by prodigies themselves provide interesting insights. They show that most child prodigies devote a substantial amount of time to learning and studying, that some prodigies experience serious problems which appear to be related to their unusual early lives, and that very few prodigies emerge in families that do not provide good opportunities to learn. The fact that evidence from prodigies and other sources of information shows that all outstanding adults were at least fairly able in childhood raises the question of whether it is ever possible for an individual who displays no signs at all of above-average ability before adulthood to eventually become outstanding over a broad range of intellectual abilities.",

The early life experience of the individual is found to be the major force in making the decision about whether and how the aggressive drives are expressed in violent forms. There are some constitutional patterns which particularly lend themselves to the more openly aggressive forms of interactive and impulsive individuals. There are environmental shaping forces which can be major influences such as being reared in a setting where violence between people is commonplace. Group pressures and influences can be later determinants. There are specific developmental stages, particularly between two and four years of age when there is active interest in and experimentation with sadistic and other violent forms of interaction and expression. It is during these stages that major decisions are made about whether the aggressive energy is expressed in socially acceptable, useful patterns and interests, or whether they will be anti‐social in nature.

When males anticipated interacting with a homosexual male, however, they rated him less favorably than did males who did not anticipate interacting with him. It was also found that both males and females liked the stimulus person less and attributed stereotypic traits to him more when he was homosexual than when he was not.

Specifically it is concerned with determining the state of the science and identifying research opportunities that could result in major reductions in work disability. Disability has be defined as (Brandt and Pope 1997): Disability is defined as a limitation in performing certain roles and tasks that society expects of an individual It is the expression of the gap between a person's capabilities and the demands of the environment - the interaction of person's limitations with social and physical environmental factors. Available data show that there are many persons in our society who are disabled in that they are unable to achieve expectations established by employers, e.g., production rates, quantities and quality, without endangering themselves or others in the workplace or community. This expectation typically extends to forty hours per week, but could be more or less hours. Limitations in performance may result from conditions of birth, illness or injury. They also may be a primary or secondary effect of work. This is the case with Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders; WMSDs. WMSDs are a leading cause of work disability and compensation in many contemporary work settings. Although this program focuses on prevention of disability due to WMSDs, it is broadly concerned with the prevention of all disability. The models and methods discussed have common elements that are applicable to many if not all persons and situations. For example, the above definition defines disability as a “gap” between job demands and worker capacities. This definition applies to a person with paraplegia as well as a person with carpal tunnel syndrome. In both instances, methods are needed for assessing and comparing worker capacities and job demands. The program includes presentations by leading investigators who will draw on their own work and work of others to describe the state of the art and develop recommendations for future research.",

      "abstract": "Lifespan perspectives on personality development have gained much momentum in recent years, mostly focusing on benevolent and neutral traits such as the Big Five. Despite their strong associations with critical personal outcomes, surprisingly little research has investigated the development of malevolent traits. Addressing this gap, we examined age trends in Machiavellianism across the lifespan.Using data from a large-scale cross-sectional sample (n = 1,118,643), we analyzed mean-level changes from age 10 to 67.Age differences in Machiavellianism were most pronounced as a strong upward trend during the transition from late childhood to adolescence, when it peaked. Throughout adulthood it exhibited a steady downward trend, reaching an overall minimum at age 65. Across the lifespan, Machiavellianism tended to be higher in men and high-income participants. Compared to Machiavellianism, the age trends in Agreeableness and-to a lesser extent-Conscientiousness showed almost perfectly polar opposite patterns.Age trends in malevolent personality conform to established patterns of normative change, indicating temporary disruption in adolescence and social maturation across adulthood. The results advance theory and research on personality trait development across the lifespan and highlight crucial developmental windows that can inform targeted interventions to keep socially aversive traits in check.",

Anger and aggression exist in all human beings, though these may remain buried, as in some passive, quiet children who may give an impression of meekness and gentility. A possible outcome is, therefore, the attempted self-destruction by the adolescent of his own body, it is as if his body is held responsible for his unbearable thoughts or his guilt feelings, or for the physical sensations that he experiences. The extent of guilt that exists is never easy to assess in any individual, but the breaking-point may be much closer in vulnerable young people than may seem to be the case at first glance.",

The strong consensus is that sex-related differences increase with age and that early adolescence, when pubertal change occurs, is the crucial time period for the substantive differentiation of the sexes in performance on spatial tasks, with males performing better on most tasks. The development of sex differences in cognition, often thought to merge in adolescence, has been attributed to a variety of influences. A common explanation for behavioral changes seen in adolescence is that puberty causes great upheaval in adolescent behavior. A clear factor in success on cognitive tasks is experience. It has been proposed that experience leading to skill development is influenced by genderrole stereo-types and expectations. The substantial evidence that neurological development continues at least until puberty indicates that plasticity in development may also occur until this time.",

One potential avenue by which it may occur is the misinterpretation of social cues, and such misperception may be mediated by extreme sex role adherence, i.e., hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity. 62 undergraduate students viewed a film of a neutral interaction between a college-aged man and woman. Subsequently, participants indicated which behaviors they remembered the opposite-sex actor performing, offered a prediction as to the outcome of the scenario and what they would do had they been in a similar situation, and then completed either the Hypermasculinity Inventory or the Hyperfemininity Scale. Scores on the former correlated negatively with recall accuracy, and men indicated that they were more likely to date and have sex with the actress than women reported being likely to date or have sex with the actor. Women reported a high perceived likelihood of dating the actor coupled with the expectation that he would have sex with the actress. Likewise, women expected to be sexually coerced by the actor had they been in a similar situation. Social implications of these findings and possible research are discussed.",

Kemampuan berkomunikasi dan penyesuaian diri yang baik dan efektif terutama sangat diperlukan oleh para remaja. Hal ini sesuai dengan salah satu tugas perkembangan masa remaja yang tersulit yaitu berhubungan dengan penyesuaian sosial. Masa remaja dikenal sebagai usia bermasalah, remaja dituntut berperilaku sesuai aturan kelompok, dimana aturan tersebut seringkali berbeda dengan cara, kebiasaan dan norma yang diterapkan oleh keluarga. Remaja harus cermat dalam membedakan yang benar dan salah. Aturan kelompok kadangkala memaksa sehingga remaja perlu berperilaku asertif untuk melindungi diri dari pergaulan yang tidak baik. Lebih dari 200 remaja perempuan meninggal setiap hari disebabkan komplikasi pengguguran, perilaku seks pranikah itu cenderung dilakukan karena pengaruh teman sebaya. Dari berbagai dampak yang ada dapat dilihat bahwa kerugian terbesar dialami remaja perempuan. Remaja perempuan kurang dapat berpikir logis disaat mendapat bujukan atau rayuan dari pacarnya, remaja perempuan juga perlu bersikap tegas terhadap bujukan atau pengaruh laki-laki untuk melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perbedaan asertifitas remaja ditinjau dari jenis kelamin.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif. Sampel penelitian adalah remaja yang berusia antara 14-15 tahun, sedang menempuh pendidikan di tingkat SMP kelas III berjumlah 120 orang yang di ambil dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Sedangkan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah skala likert yaitu skala perilaku asertif. Pengambilan data dilakukan pada tanggal 22 - 25 Februari 2011. Adapun metode analisis yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Independent sample t-test dengan program SPSS 13.00 for windows.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa ada perbedaan asertifitas remaja yang sangat signifikan ditinjau dari jenis kelamin, laki-laki (157.78) sedangkan perempuan (147.63). Hasil uji hipotesis menunjukkan t = 2.925; p = 0.004. Dengan demikian hipotesis di terima, hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang sangat signifikan asertifitas remaja laki-laki dan remaja perempuan.

      "abstract": "In this article, the author details how 16–18-year-old boys ascribe to the tenets of inclusive masculinity in a U.K. secondary school that the author calls “Standard High.” Drawing on five months of participant observation and twelve in-depth interviews, this article demonstrates that the boys' masculinities are predicated in opposition to the orthodox values of homophobia, misogyny, and aggressiveness. Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists. Here, boys are stratified in accordance to a popularity ranking, which is determined by the possession of a matrix of variables: Namely, charisma, authenticity, emotional support, and social fluidity.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Fecal Incontinence",
      "abstract": "DEFINITION Fecal incontinence is defined as either the involuntary passage or the inability to control the discharge of fecal matter through the anus. Clinically there are three subtypes (a) passive incontinence—the involuntary discharge of stool or gas without awareness; (b) urge incontinence—the discharge of fecal matter in spite of active attempts to retain bowel contents, and (c) fecal seepage—the leakage of stool following otherwise normal evacuation. The severity of incontinence can range from the unintentional elimination of flatus to the seepage of liquid fecal matter or sometimes the complete evacuation of bowel contents. Not surprisingly, these events cause considerable embarrassment, which in turn can lead to a loss of self-esteem, social isolation, and a diminished quality of life (1). EPIDEMIOLOGY Although fecal incontinence affects people of all ages, its prevalence is disproportionally higher in women, in the elderly, and in nursing home residents. Estimates of its prevalence vary greatly and depend on the clinical setting, the influence of social stigma, the definition of incontinence, and the frequency of occurrence. In the U.S. householder survey, frequent leakage of stool or fecal staining for more than 1 month was reported by 7.1% and 0.7% of the population, respectively (2). In contrast, two or more episodes of fecal incontinence per month were reported by 0.8% of patients presenting to primary care clinics in the UK (3). In an elderly (>65 yr) self-caring population, fecal incontinence occurred at least once a week in 3.7% of subjects and in more men than women (men:women = 1.5:1) (4). In contrast, 25–35% of institutionalized patients (5) and 10–25% of hospitalized geriatric patients (6) suffer from fecal incontinence. In the United States, fecal incontinence is the second leading cause for placement in nursing homes (6). In a survey of 2,570 households, comprising 6,959 individuals, the prevalence of at least one episode of incontinence during the previous year was 2.2%; among these 63% were women, 30% were >65 yr of age, 36% were incontinent of solid stool, 54% of liquid stool, and 60% of flatus (7). Furthermore, in another prospective survey of patients attending either a gastroenterology or a primary care clinic, over 18% reported fecal incontinence at least once a week (8). Only one third had ever discussed the problem with a physician (8). When stratified for the frequency of episodes, 2.7% of patients reported daily incontinence, 4.5% weekly, and 7.1% once per month (8). In another survey, fecal incontinence was associated with urinary incontinence in 26% of women attending a Uro/Gyn Clinic (9). A higher incidence of mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was also reported in nursing home residents (10, 11). The cost of health care related to fecal incontinence includes items that can be measured such as the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of incontinence, medications, the use of disposable pads and other ancillary devices, skin care, and nursing care. Approximately $400 million/year were spent for adult diapers (8, 12) and between $1.5 and $7 billion/year were spent on care for incontinence among institutionalized elderly patients (6, 13). In a long-term facility, the annual cost for a patient with both mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was $9,711 (14). In the outpatient setting, the average cost per patient (including evaluation) was estimated at $17,166 (15). Additionally, there are other costs that cannot be measured such as the impaired quality of life and social dysfunction (1). SUMMARY. The prevalence of fecal incontinence ranges between 1% and 7.4% in otherwise healthy people and up to 25% in those who are institutionalized. Both the embarrassment and the social stigma attached to this disorder, often delay presentation as well as treatment for several years. Fecal incontinence not only causes significant morbidity in the community but it also consumes substantial health care resources. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Functional Anatomy and Physiology of the Anorectum The neuromuscular integrity of the rectum, anus, and the adjoining pelvic floor musculature helps to maintain normal fecal continence. The rectum is a muscular tube composed of a continuous layer of longitudinal muscle that interlaces with the underlying circular muscle. This unique muscle arrangement enables the rectum to serve both as a reservoir for stool and as a pump for emptying stool. The anus is a muscular tube 2–4 cm. long, which at rest forms an angle with the axis of the rectum. At rest, the anorectal angle is approximately 90 degrees, with voluntary squeeze it becomes more acute, approximately 70 degrees, and during defecation it becomes more obtuse, about 110–130 degrees. The anal sphincter consists of the internal anal sphincter, which is a 0.3–0.5 cm thick expansion of the circular smooth muscle layer of the rectum, and the external anal sphincter which is a 0.6–1 cm thick expansion of the striated levator ani muscles. Morphologically, both sphincters are separate and heterogeneous (16). The anus is normally closed by the tonic activity of the internal anal sphincter and this barrier is reinforced by the external anal sphincter during voluntary squeeze. The anal mucosal folds together with the expansile anal vascular cushions provide a tight seal. These mechanical barriers are augmented by the puborectalis muscle, which forms a flap-like valve that creates a forward pull and reinforces the anorectal angle to prevent incontinence (16). The anorectum is innervated by sensory, motor, and autonomic parasympathetic nerves as well as by the enteric nervous system. The principal nerve is the pudendal nerve, which arises from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves and innervates the external anal sphincter, the anal mucosa, and the anorectal wall. This is a mixed nerve and subserves both sensory and motor function (17). Its course through the pelvic floor makes it vulnerable to stretch injury, particularly during vaginal delivery. It is likely that rectal contents are periodically sensed by the process of \"ano rectal sampling\" (18, 19). This process may be facilitated by transient relaxations of the internal anal sphincter that allows the movement of stool or flatus from the rectum into the upper anal canal where they may come into contact with specialized sensory end organs such as the numerous Krause end-bulbs, Golgi–Mazzoni bodies and genital corpuscles and the relatively sparse Meissner's corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles (20). Specialized afferent nerves for touch, cold, tension, and friction subserve these organized nerve endings. An intact \"sampling reflex\" allows the individual to choose whether to discharge or retain their rectal contents, whereas an impaired \"sampling reflex\" may predispose to incontinence (19, 20). In contrast, the rectal epithilium shows no organized nerve endings (21). Myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers are present adjacent to the rectal mucosa, the submucosa and the myenteric plexus. These subserve the sensation of distention and stretch and mediate the viscero-visceral, the rectoanal inhibitory, and contractile responses (22). The sensation of rectal distention travels along the parasympathetic system to S2, S3, and S4 (21). Thus, the sacral nerves are intimately involved with the sensory, motor, and autonomic function of the anorectum and in maintaining continence. Pathogenic Mechanisms and Etiology Incontinence occurs when one or more mechanisms that maintain continence are disrupted to an extent that other mechanisms are unable to compensate. Thus, the cause of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial (23–25). In a prospective study, 80% of patients had more than one pathogenic abnormality (23). In adult women, obstetric trauma is a major predisposing factor (26). This injury may involve either the external anal sphincter, the internal anal sphincter, or the pudendal nerves or all three structures. In prospective studies, nearly 35% of primiparous women (normal ante partum) showed evidence of sphincter disruption following vaginal delivery (26–28). Other important risk factors include forceps delivery, prolonged second stage of labor, large birth weight, and occipito-posterior presentation (29–31). Perineal tears, even when carefully repaired, can be associated with incontinence, and patients may either present immediately or several years following delivery (27). Other causes of anatomic disruption include iatrogenic factors such as anorectal surgery for hemorrhoids, fistulas, or fissures. Anal dilatation or lateral sphincterotomy may result in permanent incontinence due to fragmentation of the internal anal sphincter (32, 33). The internal anal sphincter is occasionally and inadvertently damaged during hemorrhoidectomy (34). Accidental perineal trauma or a pelvic fracture may also cause direct sphincter trauma leading to incontinence (35). In the absence of structural defects, internal anal sphincter dysfunction may occur because of a myopathy (36, 37), or internal sphincter degeneration (37), or a complication of radiotherapy (38, 39). Neurological diseases can affect continence by interfering with either sensory perception or motor function, or both. In the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, brain tumors, sedation, dorsal and spinal cord lesion may each cause incontinence (40–43). In the peripheral nervous system, cauda equina lesions, diabetic neuropathy (41, 44, 45), toxic neuropathy from alcohol, or traumatic neuropathy in the post partum setting may all lead to fecal incontinence. Up to 30% of patients with multiple sclerosis are incontinent (41). Skeletal muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and other myopathies can affect external anal sphincter and puborectalis function. Reconstructive procedures such as ileoanal (46) or coloanal pouches (47) can increase anorectal capacity and may improve continence. However, up to 40% of patients with an ileoanal pouch experience periodic, often nocturnal fecal incontinence, possibly related to uncoordinated pouch contractions (48). Similarly, rectal prolapse may be associated with fecal incontinence in up to 88% of cases (49–51). This is most likely due to prolonged inhibition of anal tone from intussusception of the rectum into the upper anal canal. Conditions that decrease rectal compliance and accommodation may also cause fecal incontinence (52). Etiologies include radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis, rectal inflammation secondary to ulcerative colitis (53, 54), or Crohn's disease and infiltration of the rectum by tumor, ischemia, or following radical hysterectomy (39). Rarely other causes include high intrarectal pressures generated in some patients with ulcerative colitis (53), or with severe voluminous diarrhea (55). In many patients fecal seepage or staining of undergarments is due to the incomplete evacuation of stool. A majority of these patients show obstructive or dyssynergic defecation (56). In these patients, anal sphincter and pudendal nerve function are intact but the ability to evacuate stool is impaired (56). Many also exhibit impaired rectal sensation (56, 57). Similarly, in the elderly and in children with functional incontinence, the prolonged retention of stool in the rectum leads to fecal impaction. Fecal impaction causes prolonged relaxation of the internal anal sphincter tone that allows liquid stool to flow around impacted stool and to escape through the anal canal (58). SUMMARY. Anal sphincter disruption or weakness, pudendal neuropathy, impaired anorectal sensation, impaired rectal accommodation, or incomplete evacuation may all contribute to the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence. These changes may be a consequence of local, anatomical, or systemic disorders. Thus, the origin of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Patients with fecal incontinence may be categorized into passive or urge incontinence or fecal seepage and their severity can be graded based on a prospective stool diary and clinical features. The evaluation of a patient with fecal incontinence involves a detailed clinical assessment together with the appropriate physiological and imaging tests of the anorectum. These three sources of information are complementary and should provide useful data regarding the severity of the problem, the underlying etiological factors, and the impact of the problem on the quality of life. Equipped with this knowledge, it is possible to design appropriate treatment strategies that could lead to clinical improvement. Clinical Features Many patients who suffer with fecal incontinence or soiling, take refuge under the term \"diarrhea\" or \"urgency\" (59). Thus, the first step in the evaluation is to establish a rapport with the patient and to confirm the existence of fecal incontinence. Thereafter, further characterization is desirable. This can include an assessment of its duration, its progression, its nature, i.e., incontinence of flatus, liquid stool, or solid stool, and its impact on the quality of life (Table 1). The use of pads or other devices and the ability to discriminate between formed or unformed stool and gas should be enquired. A detailed inquiry should also include obstetric history, a history of coexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pelvic radiation, neurological problems or spinal cord injury, dietary history, and a history of coexisting urinary incontinence. Also, during clinical assessment, it is useful to ask if a patient can differentiate between formed and unformed stool or flatus, i.e., the presence of rectoanal agnosia. A prospective stool diary may also be very useful (Fig. 1).Table 1: A List of Important Information That Should be Elicited When Taking a History in a Patient with Suspected Fecal IncontinenceFigure 1: A sample stool diary for assessing patients with fecal incontinence. Use the following descriptors for describing stool consistency: Type 1: Separate hard lumps. Type 2: Sausage shaped but lumpy. Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface. Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft. Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily). Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool. Type 7: Watery.The circumstances under which incontinence occurs should also be determined. Such a detailed inquiry may facilitate the identification of the following possible scenarios: Passive incontinence—which is the involuntary discharge of fecal matter or flatus without any awareness. This suggests a loss of perception and/or impaired rectoanal reflexes either with or without sphincter dysfunction. Urge incontinence—which is the discharge of fecal matter or flatus in spite of active attempts to retain these contents. Here, there is a predominant disruption of the sphincter function or the rectal capacity to retain stool. Fecal seepage—which is the undesired leakage of stool, often after a bowel movement with otherwise normal continence and evacuation. This condition is mostly due to incomplete evacuation of stool and/or impaired rectal sensation (56, 58). The sphincter function and pudendal nerve function are mostly intact (56, 57). Although there is an overlap between these three groups, by making a clinical distinction, it is possible to assess the underlying etiology and to guide investigations and management. Symptom assessment can also provide useful insights regarding the underlying mechanism(s), but may not correlate well with manometric findings. In one study, leakage had a sensitivity of 98.9%, a specificity of 11%, and a positive predictive value of 51% for detecting low resting anal sphincter pressures (31). The positive predictive value for detecting a low squeeze pressure was 80% (31). Thus, for an individual patient with incontinence, history and clinical features alone are insufficient to define the pathophysiology and therefore objective testing is essential. Nevertheless, based on the clinical features, several grading systems have been proposed. Recently, a modification of the Cleveland Clinic grading system (60) has been validated by the St. Mark's investigators (61). This system can provide an objective method of quantifying the degree of incontinence. It can also be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapy. This grading system is based on seven parameters that include whether the anal discharge is either solid, liquid or flatus, and whether the problem causes alterations in lifestyle, (scores: Never = 0, Always = 5); the need to wear a pad or the need to take antidiarrheal medication, and the ability to defer defecation (scores: No—0, yes—2). The score ranges from 0 (continent) to 24 (severe incontinence). Clinical features alone are, however, insufficient to define the pathophysiology. The use of validated questionnaires such as the SCL-90R SF-36 may provide additional information regarding the psychosocial issues and impact on the quality of or life. Physical Examination This should include a detailed physical and neurological examination of the back and the lower limbs, because incontinence may be secondary to a systemic or a neurological disorder. The perineal inspection and digital rectal examination is best performed with the patient lying in the left lateral position and with good illumination. Upon inspection, the presence of fecal matter, prolapsed hemorrhoids, dermatitis, scars, skin excoriation, the absence of perianal creases, or a gaping anus may be noted. These features suggest either sphincter weakness or chronic skin irritation and provide clues regarding the underlying etiology. Excessive perineal descent or rectal prolapse can be demonstrated by asking the patient to attempt defecation. An outward bulge that exceeds 3 cm is usually defined as excessive perineal descent (62). The perianal sensation should also be checked. The anocutaneous reflex examines the integrity of the connection between the sensory nerves and the skin, the intermediate neurons in the spinal cord segments S2, S3, and S4, and the motor innervation of the external anal sphincter. This can be assessed by gently stroking the perianal skin with a cotton bud in each of the perianal quadrants. The normal response consists of a brisk contraction of the external anal sphincter. Impaired or absent anocutaneous reflex suggests either afferent or efferent neuronal injury (63). Digital Rectal Examination Recommendation: Digital rectal examination can identify patients with fecal impaction and overflow. It is not accurate enough for diagnosing sphincter dysfunction or for initiating therapy. After inserting a lubricated, gloved index finger, one should assess the resting sphincter tone, the length of the anal canal, the integrity of the puborectalis sling, the acuteness of the anorectal angle, the strength of the anal muscle, and the elevation of the perineum during voluntary squeeze. Also, the presence of a rectocele or impacted stools may be noted. Unlike the examination of other organs, one should exercise considerable sensitivity and allay any fears when performing a digital rectal examination. The accuracy of digital rectal examination—as an objective test for evaluating anal sphincter function—has been assessed in several studies. In one study of 66 patients, digital examination by an experienced surgeon was somewhat correlated with resting sphincter pressure (r = 0.56; p < 0.001) or maximum squeeze pressure (r = 0.72: p < 0.001) (64). In another study of 280 patients with several anorectal disorders, a reasonable correlation was reported between digital palpation and manometry (65). However, the sensitivity, the specificity, and the positive predictive value of the digital exam were very low (65). By the digital exam, the positive predictive value of detecting a low sphincter tone was 66.7% and a low squeeze tone was 81% (31). In another study of 64 patients, the agreement between digital examination and resting anal canal pressure or squeeze pressure was 0.41 and 0.52, respectively (66). These data suggest that digital examination is only an approximation, which is influenced by many factors including the size of the examiner's finger, the technique, and the cooperation of the patient. Thus, it is not very reliable and is prone to interobserver differences.Table 2: Treatment of Fecal IncontinenceINVESTIGATIONS OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Endoscopic evaluation of the rectosigmoid region is appropriate for detecting mucosal disease or neoplasia that may contribute to fecal incontinence. At the outset it is important to distinguish whether the incontinence is either secondary to diarrhea or independent of stool consistency. If there is coexisting diarrhea, a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed to exclude colonic mucosal inflammation, a rectal mass, or stricture. Stool studies, including stool screening for infection, stool volume, stool osmolality and electrolytes may be performed. Similarly, biochemical tests may reveal thyroid dysfunction, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Breath tests may reveal lactose or fructose intolerance or bacterial overgrowth (24). Several specific tests are available for defining the underlying mechanisms of fecal incontinence (23, 52, 63, 67). These tests are often complementary (23, 52, 63, 67). The most useful tests are anorectal manometry, anal endosonography, balloon expulsion test and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (23, 52, 63, 67). A description of these tests and others that are commonly used for the evaluation of fecal incontinence and their clinical significance has been discussed in detail by Diamant et al. (67). Hence, a brief description of these tests and their clinical relevance is presented here with particular emphasis on recent literature and contentious issues. Anorectal Manometry and Sensory Testing Recommendation: Anorectal manometry with rectal sensory testing is the preferred method for defining the functional weakness of the external or internal anal sphincter and for detecting abnormal rectal sensation. Measurement of rectal compliance (reservoir function) may be helpful in some patients. These tests may also facilitate biofeedback training. Anorectal manometry provides an objective assessment of anal sphincter pressures together with an assessment of rectal sensation, rectoanal reflexes, and rectal compliance. Currently, several types of probes and pressure-recording devices are available. Each system has distinct advantages and drawbacks (63, 68, 69). A water-perfused probe with multiple closely spaced sensors is commonly used (63, 69). Alternatively, a solid-state probe with micro-transducers may be used (63, 69). Although more expensive and fragile, they do not require perfusion equipment, are easier to calibrate, and are possibly more accurate (63, 68). The anal sphincter pressures can be measured by stationary, station pull-through, or rapid pull-through techniques, but the former two are probably more accurate (63, 67, 68). A rapid pull-through technique can give falsely high sphincter pressures (67, 70). The resting anal sphincter pressure predominantly represents the internal anal sphincter function and the voluntary squeeze anal pressure predominantly measures the external anal sphincter function. Patients with incontinence have been shown to have low resting and low squeeze sphincter pressures (65, 71, 72). The duration of the sustained squeeze pressure provides an index of sphincter muscle fatigue. The ability of the external anal sphincter to contract in a reflex manner can also be assessed during abrupt increases of intraabdominal pressure such as when coughing (25, 63, 68, 69). This reflex response causes the anal sphincter pressure to rise above that of the rectal pressure to preserve continence. The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. In patients with spinal cord lesions above the conus medullaris, this reflex response is present but the voluntary squeeze may be absent, whereas in patients with lesions of the cauda equina or sacral plexus both the reflex response and the voluntary squeeze response are absent (63, 73, 75). The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. Sensory Testing Rectal balloon distention with either air or water can be used for the assessment of both the sensory responses and the compliance of the rectal wall. By distending a balloon in the rectum with incremental volumes, it is possible to assess the thresholds for first perception, a first desire or an urgent desire to defecate (25, 52, 63, 68, 69). A higher threshold for sensory perception suggests impaired rectal sensation (23, 25, 41, 52, 71). Also, the balloon volume required for partial or complete inhibition of anal sphincter tone can be assessed. It has been shown that the volume required to induce reflex anal relaxation was lower in incontinent patients than controls (71, 74). Because sampling of rectal contents by the anal mucosa may play an important role in maintaining continence (18, 19), quantitative assessment of anal perception using either electrical (22) or thermal (22, 76) stimulation has been advocated. In one study, anal mucosal sensation was assessed by recording perception threshold for electrical stimulation of the mid anal canal using a ring electrode (77). A combined sensory and motor defect was seen in patients with incontinence (77). In another study, although anal canal perception was impaired immediately after a vaginal delivery, there was no difference at 6 months (78). The role of thermosensitivity appears controversial (22). In one study, the ability of healthy anal mucosa to differentiate between small changes in temperature has been questioned (79). Hence, under normal conditions it is not possible to appreciate the temperature of fecal matter passing from the rectum to the anal canal during sampling (79). Whether patients have a pure sensory defect of anus without coexisting sphincter dysfunction or rectal sensory impairment has not been shown. In contrast, a combined sensory and motor defect has been reported in many studies (77, 78, 80). Rectal compliance can be calculated by assessing the changes in rectal pressure during balloon distention with air or fluid (41, 44, 52, 67, 68). The ratio dv/dp describes the relationship. Rectal compliance is reduced in patients with colitis (53, 54) and in patients with low spinal cord lesions and in diabetics with incontinence (41, 44, 52). In contrast, compliance is increased in high spinal cord lesion (42, 75). When performed meticulously, anorectal manometry can provide useful information regarding anorectal function (23, 52, 67, 80). A technical review recommended the use of anorectal manometry for the evaluation of patients with incontinence because it can define the functional weakness of one or both sphincters and helps to perform and evaluate the responses to biofeedback training (67). Unfortunately, to date there has been no uniform technique or equipment for performing anorectal manometry (81). Also, there is a dearth of normative data and uniform methods of interpreting test results. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop standards of testing anorectal function and to validate the significance of abnormal results. Recently, the American Motility Society has initiated an international collaborative effort to develop standards for manometry testing and a consensus document has been published (82). Such efforts may lead to standardization of testing and interpretation of anorectal manometry. Although there are insufficient data regarding normal values, overlap among healthy subjects and patients with incontinence (65, 67), and large confidence intervals in studies that have examined test reproducibility (64, 83), for the individual patient with incontinence, manometry testing can be very useful. Manometric tests of anorectal function may also be useful in assessing objective improvement following drug therapy (84), biofeedback therapy (85), or surgery (86). Imaging the Anal Canal Recommendation: Anal endosonography is the simplest, most widely available and least expensive test for defining structural defects of the anal sphincter and should be considered in patients with suspected fecal incontinence. ANAL ENDOSONOGRAPHY. Traditionally, anal endosonography has been performed using a 7 mHz rotating transducer with a focal length of 1–4 cm (87). It provides an assessment of the thickness and structural integrity of the external and internal anal sphincter muscle and can detect the presence of scarring, loss of muscle tissue, and other local pathology (87, 88). More recently, higher frequency (10–15 mHz) probes that provide better delineation of the sphincter complex have become available (89). After vaginal delivery, anal endosonography has revealed occult sphincter injury in 35% of primipara women and most of these lesions were not detected clinically (27). In another study, sphincter defects were detected in 85% of women with third-degree perineal tear compared with 33% of subjects without tears (28). In studies that compared EMG mapping with anal endosonography, there was a high concordance rate for identifying sphincter defects using both modalities (90, 91). The technique is, however, operator dependent and requires both training and experience (67). Although endosonography can distinguish an internal sphincter injury from that of an external sphincter injury, it has a low specificity for demonstrating the etiology of fecal incontinence (92). Because anal endosonography is more widely available, is less expensive, and is certainly less painful than needle insertion, currently, it is the preferred technique for examining the",

Much remains to be learned about both the somatic and the psychological aspects. Research and reliable reporting about spinal-cord-injured women has been scant. It is important to keep in mind that there is great variation from one individual to another and, even in the same individual, from one time to another. The goal of sexual activity is satisfaction for the particular individual within the limits possible, not reaching for a standard and probably impossible ideal of function and feeling (1,2).",

Do children possess the sort of meta-theory of acting that adults possess? In two studies we find that, unlike adults, children between the ages of 3–5 do not think that a realistic actor is better at portraying a characteristic than a nonrealistic actor, nor do they prefer one to the other. As they develop, they come to understand that realistic acting is different from nonrealistic acting, but unlike adults, children think that a nonrealistic, pretense-like portrayal is more difficult to achieve than a realistic representation of an emotional or physical state. These findings show that children's metarepresentational understanding of acting is relatively immature at age 5, and that their understanding of this specific domain of pretense lags behind their understanding of pretense in general.",

      "title": "High Reproductive Success Despite Queuing – Socio-Sexual Development of Males in a Complex Social Environment",
      "abstract": "The start of actual breeding in male social mammals can occur long after individuals attain sexual maturity. Mainly prevented from reproduction by older and dominant males, young males often queue until strong enough to compete for favorable social positions and, in this way, to obtain access to females. However, to what extent maturing males also apply tactics to reproduce before this time is largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to elucidate male socio-sexual development from onset of sexual maturity through first mating success until the achievement of a stable social position in a complex social environment. For this purpose, guinea pigs were used as a model system and reproductive success of males living in large mixed-sex colonies was assessed during their first year of life. As a reference, males in a mixed-sex pair situation were examined. Pair-housed males reproduced for the first time around the onset of sexual maturity whereas colony-housed males did so much later in life and with a considerably higher variance. In colonies, reproductive success was significantly affected by dominance status. Dominance itself was age-dependent, with older males having significantly higher dominance ranks than younger males. Surprisingly, both younger and older colony-housed males attained substantial reproductive success of comparable amounts. Thus, younger males reproduced irrespective of queuing and already before reaching a high social status. This mating success of maturing males was most likely achieved via several reproductive tactics which were flexibly applied with the onset of sexual maturity. The period of socio-sexual development before a stable social position is established may, therefore, be a time during which male mammals use flexible behavioral tactics to achieve reproductive success more frequently than commonly is presumed. In addition, the findings strongly indicate that high behavioral plasticity exists well beyond sexual maturity.",

Although estimates of child sexual abuse prevalence differ widely owing to disclosure biases and the definitions that researchers have used in studying it, it is clear that child sexual abuse is a serious public problem. Also troubling is the extent to which “normal” adults, especially males, exhibit sexual interest in children, suggesting that a substantial number may be at risk for victimizing minors; fortunately, a variety of inhibitory mechanisms prevent most adults from committing this crime. Although victims typically suffer from sexual abuse, surprisingly, some evidence suggests that victims of sexual abuse can exhibit neutral or even positive outcomes, a controversial finding that has numerous possible explanations. Tragically, childhood sexual abuse may lead the victim to become an abuser later in life, sometimes while still a minor.

However, traditional notions of heteronormativity and heterosexual masculinity prevented boys from talking about, understanding and handling experiences that may be identified as digital sexual harassment. Additionally, because of traditional gendered perceptions, students had difficulty categorizing victims and perpetrators of sexting.

      "title": "Disorders of Sex Development",
      "abstract": "Traditionally, ambiguous genitalia have been defined as a \"medical and social emergency\"; however, it is not. It requires a systematic, team-oriented approach.Access to genetic testing and molecular diagnosis permits better understanding of conditions that produce ambiguous genitalia and allows better planning for gender assignment and further care.After completing this article, readers should be able to: Disorders of sex development (DSDs), a vastly heterogeneous array of innate conditions, are secondary to abnormal development of sex chromosomes, as well as atypical growth of the gonads and genital anatomy. Specifically, DSDs result from insufficient virilization of the genitalia in a 46,XY fetus due to disorders of gonadal development, abnormal androgen synthesis, or disorders of androgen action, or secondary to the masculinization of the genitals of a 46,XX fetus. There is broad phenotypic expression of DSDs, ranging from minor variations of gonadal function and genital appearance to severely atypical gonads and genitalia.The incidence of ambiguous genitalia at birth is estimated to be 1:4,500 to 1:5,500. (1) Among 46,XY individuals, the incidence of DSDs has been estimated to be 1:20,000 births; however, cryptorchidism and hypospadias are common congenital anomalies, occurring in 1:200 to 1:300 newborns. (1) Among 46,XX individuals, the most common cause of DSDs is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which occurs in 1:14,000 to 1:15,000 live births. (1)Prenatal karyotype evaluation as part of cell-free DNA testing is now common. Conditions such as complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS) or complete gonadal dysgenesis were often missed at birth or during infancy and childhood, and they can now be diagnosed sooner. This is due to affected newborns having a mismatch between their karyotype and the genital appearance on fetal ultrasonography or at birth.In 2005, the Pediatric Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology organized a meeting of international experts to create a consensus on the management of intersex disorders. At this meeting, new terminology was adopted, and terms such as intersex, pseudohermaphroditism, hermaphroditism, and sex reversal, as well as gender-based diagnostic labels, were replaced by DSDs, as defined by congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. (2) In this review, the consensus-recommended terminology is used.The development of normal genitalia (Fig 1) involves 2 processes: sex determination and sex differentiation. Sex determination depends on synchronized expression and interactions of genes and transcription factors that permit the formation and appropriate functioning of the gonad. Sexual differentiation depends on the influence of gonadal and nongonadal hormones, which then transform embryonic structures into the genitals present at birth.Testicular determination/formation depends on the presence of the SRY gene, on the Y chromosome, and encodes the testis-determining factor. The formation of the ovary requires the absence or dysfunction of SRY and a complex process that is beyond this review but is covered in the article by Tevosian and Manuylov. (3)The urogenital ridges develop from the coelomic epithelium by week 4 to 6 of gestation. Thereafter, the gonads, adrenal cortex, kidneys, and reproductive tracts form from the urogenital ridges. Expression of SRY in pre-Sertoli cells at gestation week 7 triggers the activation of genes that produce testicular formation. Sertoli cells secrete anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), which produces regression of the müllerian ducts. Leydig cells produce testosterone, which is involved in the development and differentiation of the Wolffian duct structures (epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles). 5α-Dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, is responsible for the development of the male external genitalia, urethra, and prostate. Both 5α-DHT and testosterone work through the same androgen receptor, but 5α-DHT has stronger affinity for this receptor.Sexual differentiation in females depends on the absence of testosterone/5α-DHT and AMH. Müllerian ducts will form the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper one-third of the vagina.Herein we present the most common conditions producing DSDs in four major groups: conditions produced by sex chromosome abnormalities, genetic mutations with 46,XY karyotype, genetic mutations with 46,XX karyotype, and conditions not caused by chromosomal or hormonal abnormalities.Although Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome are considered DSDs, individuals with these conditions do not have ambiguous genitalia.Mixed gonadal dysgenesis is most often secondary to 45,X/46,XY karyotypes. Individuals with this condition have 2 gonadal germ cell lines, with testicular differentiation correlated with the proportion of 46,XY cells. (4) They have 1 streak gonad on one side and a dysgenetic fibrotic testicle with disordered tubular architecture on the other, retained müllerian structures, and incomplete genital masculinization. Due to the risk of developing gonadal neoplasia, early gonadectomy is recommended. (4)Individuals with ovotesticular DSD have both testicular tissue with seminiferous tubules and ovarian tissue with follicles. They usually have ambiguous genitalia and gonads with testicular and ovarian tissue called ovotestes. Karyotypes of individuals with this condition are 60% 46,XX, 30% 46,XX/46,XY, and 10% 46,XY. (5)Although not caused by abnormalities on sex chromosomes, gonadal dysgenesis is notable herein. It is characterized by a disruption of the gonadal development. Pure gonadal dysgenesis is defined as the absence of ovarian function (streak gonads) in a phenotypical female with a 46,XX or 46,XY karyotype. The term complete gonadal dysgenesis refers more specifically to 46,XY individuals with pure gonadal dysgenesis, female external genitalia, and müllerian derivatives. This condition is also known as Swyer syndrome.In 46,XY individuals, gonadal dysgenesis is secondary to defects in testicular development or differentiation. Abnormalities in more than 18 genes have been found to be related to 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. The most common are loss-of-function mutations of SRY, NR5A1(SF1), and WT1, and gain-of-function mutations of MAP3K1 (Table 1). (6)(7)(8) If the gonads of these patients are not removed early in childhood, there is higher risk of developing gonadoblastomas and/or dysgerminomas. (9)SRY is located on the end of the short arm of the Y chromosome and encodes the protein SRY, a transcription factor. When SRY activity is absent, the undifferentiated gonad does not become a testicle. Without testes, the 46,XY fetus will have female external genitalia and müllerian structures. Mutations in SRY are found in approximately 10% to 15% of patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. (9)The transcription factor NR5A1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A, member 1), previously known as steroidogenic factor 1, regulates genes related to the development of the gonads and adrenal glands. Mutations of the NR5A1 gene explain approximately 20% of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and result in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations: Swyer syndrome; 46,XY with female phenotype, clitoromegaly, palpable gonads with partial gonadal dysgenesis, and absence of müllerian derivatives; and 46,XY with oligospermia/azoospermia. Adrenal failure is rare in 46,XY patients with mutations on NR5A1. (10)46,XY individuals with mutations of Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1) may, according to the location of the mutation, present with gonadal dysgenesis and renal disease as part of Frasier or Denys-Drash syndrome. Individuals with Frasier syndrome have female genitalia at birth, müllerian structures, as well as variable degrees of corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to segmental glomerulosclerosis. (4) Individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome have partial gonadal dysgenesis with undervirilized or ambiguous genitalia and absent müllerian structures. (4) They also have renal disease and will develop end-stage renal disease. Overlap of these conditions has been described. (11) Most individuals with WT1 mutations have a high risk of developing Wilms tumors.MAP3K1 encodes a signal transduction factor essential for testicular development. Autosomal dominant or sporadic gain-of-function mutations of this gene have been identified in 46,XY individuals with complete gonadal dysgenesis and increased risk of gonadoblastoma and in individuals with partial gonadal dysgenesis who have incomplete testicular development, micropenis, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. Recent data show that mutations on MAP3K1 may account for 28% of patients with 46,XY DSDs with complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis. (7)(8)These autosomal recessive conditions (Table 2) are secondary to enzymatic defects that affect the production of testosterone or 5α-DHT, with subsequent undermasculinization that correlates with the degree of enzymatic activity.17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17β-HSD3) catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone in the testes. (12) The external genitalia of these patients are female in most cases. Some may have clitoromegaly or ambiguous genitalia with hypoplastic Wolffian duct derivatives and bilateral cryptorchidism characterized by inguinal masses. The biochemical diagnosis is made when the ratio of testosterone to androstenedione is less than 0.8 after a human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) stimulation test. Most individuals with this condition are raised as females; during puberty, however, virilization often occurs due to extragonadal activity of other 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases or residual gonadal 17β-HSD3 activity. (12) In a report from Brazil, 5 of 15 individuals (33%) with this condition who were assigned as female at birth later changed their gender to male. None of those raised as male changed their gender. (13)5α-Reductase type 2 (5α-RD2) catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to 5α-DHT. 46,XY patients with this condition have different degrees of undermasculinization, from normal-appearing female external genitalia, to clitoromegaly without labial fusion, isolated micropenis, microphallus with differing degrees of hypospadias, and bilateral cryptorchidism. However, the most common presentation is female external genital with clitoromegaly, or microphallus with varying degrees of hypospadias. (14)Historically, most patients with this condition were raised as girls. Typically, they presented with virilization at puberty due to increased activity of the 5α-reductase type 1 enzyme and subsequent increase in testosterone levels. In reports from Brazil and France, 16 of 30 individuals (53.3%) and five of 40 individuals (12.5%), respectively, who were assigned as female at birth changed their gender to male later in life. (13)(14) Patients assigned male at birth retained male gender identity independent of the degree of virilization at birth. (13) For this reason, male gender assignment is unlikely to result in gender change later in life.This type of CAH is produced by mutations of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase type 2 (3β-HSD2), which is expressed in the adrenal glands and gonads and catalyzes the conversion of Δ5 precursors into Δ4 steroids, allowing the production of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Its deficiency, therefore, produces deficiencies in all of these hormones but elevation of their precursors, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Male newborns are undervirilized due to lack of adequate androgen production in the testes. (15)This type of CAH is produced by mutations of the CYP17A1 gene. 46,XY individuals with this condition have a feminine phenotype due to low levels of testosterone, with hypertension and hypokalemia secondary to elevated mineralocorticoid levels. On laboratory evaluation they also have elevated gonadotropin, corticotropin, progesterone, and corticosterone levels, with low 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and renin levels. (15)Lipoid CAH is most often caused by mutations in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which moves cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membranes to synthesize pregnenolone. This condition is more common among Japanese, Palestinian, and Korean individuals. Patients with lipoid CAH have impairment of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis. 46,XY individuals with this condition are born with female phenotype and absent müllerian derivatives; however, due to some steroidogenesis independent of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, they do not develop adrenal crisis in the first months after birth. Elevation of the corticotropin level will produce hyperpigmentation and accumulation of cholesterol esters in steroid-producing cells, which will ultimately destroy these cells. (16)Defects in the androgen receptor prevent normal development of male genitalia and are the most common cause of male undermasculinization. The androgen receptor gene is located on the X-chromosome; therefore, androgen insensitivity syndrome has an X-linked pattern of inheritance, affecting only 46,XY individuals. According to the severity of the mutation, affected individuals have CAIS or partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS). Persons with CAIS characteristically have female external genitalia and absent müllerian structures; therefore, they have a short vagina with a blind ending, absent Wolffian-derived structures, no prostate, and absent pubic and axillary hair as adults. They have normal breast development, normal to elevated testosterone levels, elevated estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and normal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels during and after puberty if the testicles are not removed before puberty. (17)(18) Feminization is secondary to aromatization of high levels of testosterone to estrogens. Individuals with PAIS have a wide spectrum of findings, according to the severity of the androgen receptor mutation. They may have female external genitalia with clitoromegaly and some degree of labial fusion, ambiguous genitalia with micropenis, perineal hypospadias, and cryptorchidism, or a well-formed penis with variable degrees of hypospadias, or isolated infertility. (18)As previously mentioned, CAIS is often diagnosed when there is a mismatch between the prenatal karyotype and the genital appearance on fetal ultrasonography or at birth. Previously, this diagnosis was suspected when a prepubertal girl was found to have male gonads during evaluations of inguinal hernias or on evaluation for primary amenorrhea. Gonadectomy was frequently performed at the time of diagnosis due to suspected increased malignancy; however, recent data show that this risk is low. If gonads are not removed, the development of thelarche occurs at a normal age.Leydig cell hypoplasia is an autosomal recessive condition caused by loss-of-function mutations on the LH/HCG receptor, whose activation is essential for the maturation of Leydig cells and testosterone production. In 46,XY individuals, Leydig cell hypoplasia is characterized by various degrees of decreased virilization, from normal-appearing female genitalia with bilateral masses in the inguinal region to micropenis and/or hypospadias and/or cryptorchidism, low baseline testosterone levels without response to HCG stimulation, and elevated gonadotropin levels. (19)Gonadal dysgenesis in a female is more commonly secondary to Turner syndrome with 45,X or 46,XX/45,X genotypes. Other causes of gonadal dysgenesis in 46,XX individuals are FSH receptor abnormalities and mitochondrial histidyl transfer RNA synthetase mutations.Approximately 60% of individuals with ovotesticular DSD have a 46,XX karyotype. (5) They are caused by SRY translocations, duplications of SOX3 and SOX9, mutations in RSPO1, WNT4, NR2F2, or a specific mutation in NR5A1. Patients with SRY gene translocations to the X, or to an autosomal chromosome, explain most of these cases; they have ambiguous or male genitalia, small azoospermic testicles, and elevated gonadotropin levels. (20)21-Hydroxylase (CYP21A2) deficiency is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in 46,XX individuals. Approximately 95% of the cases of CAH are caused by recessive mutations in CYP21A2, which converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to deoxycorticosterone substrates for the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone, respectively. The classic form affects approximately 1:14,000 to 1:15,000 newborns and is classified as either salt wasting, which happens in 75% of patients, or simple virilizing, which occurs in 25%. A milder, more common form, nonclassic CAH, affects 1:500 to 1:1,000 newborns. Females with the classic form have ambiguous genitalia, graded according to severity on the Prader scale from 1 to 5 (Table 3). (21) Some females with the nonclassic form have clitoromegaly. The diagnosis is facilitated in most developed countries by the implementation of newborn screenings.11β-Hydroxylase type 1 (CYP11B1) deficiency represents 5% to 8% of CAH cases, affecting approximately 1:100,000 newborns. This condition is more common among the Moroccan Jewish population. CYP11B1 converts 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol to corticosterone and cortisol, respectively. Due to the low production of cortisol, high corticotropin levels stimulate the production of androgens, and girls with this condition will have ambiguous genitalia. Two-thirds of patients with this condition will develop hypertension in mid-childhood due to the high levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone, which has mineralocorticoid activity. This situation makes patients with CYP11B1 deficiency less prone to developing adrenal crisis than patients with CYP21A2 deficiency. (15)In this deficiency, elevation of the DHEA level, which is metabolized to some androgens, can produce mild virilization in the 46,XX individual. (15)This is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations of CYP19A1, which encodes aromatase. This enzyme converts androgens into estrogens in gonadal and extragonadal tissues, including the placenta. Placental tissue from the fetus with aromatase deficiency is unable to convert DHEA sulfate from the fetal adrenal glands into estrogens, with the subsequent accumulation of its precursors, androstenedione and testosterone. Affected females are born with ambiguous genitalia, and their mothers develop virilization after the first trimester of pregnancy. Affected females may develop ovarian cysts during childhood, may not develop secondary sexual characteristics at the time of puberty, and may have primary amenorrhea and signs of hyperandrogenism. If untreated, males and females with this condition will develop osteoporosis, eunuchoid habitus, and tall stature. (22)Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase is an electron donor for all microsomal P450 enzymes and other non-P450 enzymes. Mutations of this enzyme will affect the activity of enzymes involved in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and estrogens. According to the mutation, signs and symptoms vary from mild to severe. Ambiguous genitalia is usually seen in 46,XX and 46,XY newborns. Individuals with severe P450 oxidoreductase deficiency may also have skeletal anomalies such as craniosynostosis, flattened midface, prominent forehead, arachnodactyly, bowing of the thighs, and radiohumeral synostosis. This condition is known as Antley-Bixler syndrome. They also have choanal atresia, intellectual impairment, and developmental delay. Some of these newborns are born to mothers who became virilized during pregnancy due to deficiency of aromatase activity. (23)Pregnancy luteomas are benign nonneoplastic lesions of the ovaries produced by increased activity of luteinized cells under stimulation by HCG producing androgens. Approximately two-thirds of newborn girls born to virilized mothers will have a certain degree of virilization. (24)Krukenberg tumors of the ovaries are produced by metastatic adenocarcinomas from gastrointestinal tissues or the breast. Due to luteinization of the tumoral stroma, these tumors may produce androgens. During pregnancy, androgen production is higher due to elevated HCG levels. This will produce virilization of the pregnant woman and the female fetus due to placental passage of elevated androgen levels. (24)In cloacal exstrophy, aphallia, or some individuals with severe micropenis, the process of tubulization and cavitation of the caudal end of the embryo is affected, leaving an open bladder and exposing the abdominal organs. The phallic development in these individuals is highly abnormal; however, the gonads are usually unaffected. (25)Evaluation of the child with a DSD should start with a complete physical examination, including anthropometric measurements, skin assessment, identification of any midline defects and/or dysmorphic features that may be part of syndromes that include ambiguous genitalia. Jaundice is commonly seen in patients with hypopituitarism, and hyperpigmentation is seen in patients with CAH. Patients with DSDs present with 1 of the following: apparent female genitalia and clitoromegaly with variable degrees of posterior labial fusion; apparent male genitalia with micropenis, with or without palpable gonads; or variable degrees of hypospadias.In general, the Prader scale (Table 3) has been used as a basic method to evaluate the degree of genital virilization in patients with CAH and other DSDs. (21) However, use of the external masculinization score (EMS) is a more precise method to evaluate the extent of masculinization of the external genitalia. The EMS is calculated based on the site of the urethral meatus (3 indicates normal; 2, distal hypospadias; 1, medial hypospadias; and 0, proximal hypospadias), locations of the gonads (for each gonad: 1.5 indicates labioscrotal; 1, inguinal; and 0, abdominal), size of the penis (3 indicates normal; 0, micropenis), and presence of labioscrotal fusion (3 indicates fusion; 0, absent). A normal male has a score of 12 and a normal female has a score of 0. (26)Hypospadias is an abnormal location of the urethral meatus at the ventral side of the phallus, scrotum, or perineum, and it is classified as distal (glandular or subcoronal), medial (distal penile or midshaft), or proximal (penoscrotal or perineal). (27) When hypospadias is proximal, it produces a curvature of the phallus (chordee). Stretched penile length is measured by placing a ruler on the posterior aspect of the stretched penis and calculating the distance between the tip of the glans and the pubic symphysis. (27) A stretched penile length of less than –2 or –2.5 SD in any boy, or less than 2.5 cm in a term male newborn, is defined as micropenis. (28)The anogenital ratio is a marker of androgen exposure during the first trimester of gestation. In girls, it is calculated as the measure from the anus to the posterior fourchette, divided by the distance between the anus and the base of the clitoris. Mean ± SD anogenital ratio is 0.37 ± 0.07 in infants and 0.36 ± 0.07 in adults. An anogenital ratio greater than 0.5 suggests androgen-induced labioscrotal fusion and indicates a need for further evaluation. (29)Evaluation of sex chromosomes is one of the first tests to perform in an apparent male child with a low EMS, bilateral cryptorchidism, or severe hypospadias. Infants with an EMS greater than 11 do not warrant consideration for endocrine or genetic investigation. (30) Quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction allows identification of sex chromosomes with results within 1 to 2 days. In addition, a karyotype, which takes longer to be completed and reported, should be ordered simultaneously to identify any structural abnormality, chromosomal translocation, or mosaicism. (30)Laboratory evaluation of individuals with 46,XY DSDs should include LH, FSH, DHEA, androstenedione, testosterone, 5α-DHT, and AMH. Significant elevations of gonadotropin and testosterone levels are seen between 1 and 3 months of age. If testosterone levels are low, which usually occurs during the first month after birth and again after the fourth month after birth, an HCG stimulation test should be performed to clarify the diagnosis. A short protocol uses 1,500 IU of HCG intramuscularly on days 1, 3, and 5. If results are inconclusive with the short protocol, a long protocol using 1,500 IU intramuscularly every other day for a total of 7 injections is recommended. Samples taken at baseline and 48 hours after injection for DHEA, androstenedione, testosterone, and 5α-DHT should be collected. For patients with a single dose of HCG, blood samples are collected 72 hours after the injection.A low basal or post–HCG stimulation testosterone level is indicative of testicular dysgenesis or a testosterone biosynthesis defect. Normal or elevated levels of testosterone before and/or after HCG is suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome. The biochemical diagnosis of 5α-RD2 deficiency in a prepubertal child is made when the ratio of testosterone to 5α-DHT is higher than 30 after HCG stimulation testing. However, a ratio of less than 30 does not rule out the condition; therefore, when this diagnosis is suspected, DNA sequencing of SRD5A2 should be ordered.A normal AMH level is a marker of normal Sertoli cell function; however, during the newborn period, in children with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and in patients with persistent müllerian duct syndrome due to AMH gene mutations, AMH levels may be low. (31) Inhibin B is another marker of Sertoli cell function that may be used with, or in place of, AMH.Genetic analysis for mutations of the androgen receptor is recommended when a child has a DSD and normal testosterone production, proximal hypospadias, micropenis, and/or undescended testicles. However, 15% of individuals with CAIS, and 44% to 90% with apparent PAIS, are not found to have mutations of their androgen receptor. (31)The use of array comparative genomic hybridization allows for the detection of chromosomal deletions or duplications below 5 Mb, clarifying the diagnosis in approximately 20% of individuals with DSDs. (32) To increase the odds of finding a genetic diagnosis in 46,XY individuals with DSDs, when ordering array comparative genomic hybridization it is recommended to evaluate the most common genes associated with this condition: AR, NR5A1, SRY, SRD5A2, and HSD17B3. (31) The use of next-generation massive parallel targeted sequencing methods allows for the analysis of multiple genes that are known to be related to DSDs, and permits the evaluation of regulatory regions and microRNA, which cannot be detected using whole exome sequencing. (33) This technology also offers faster results than whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. One problem with these tests is the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance in genes that are not known to be related to DSDs. (31)Because CAH is the most common cause of DSDs in 46,XX individuals, evaluation of adrenal steroids, plasma renin activity, and electrolytes is essential. It is important to know that premature babies have higher levels of 17-OHP than term infants. If results are not conclusive, a cosyntropin stimulation test may be ordered after 48 hours of age. A dose of 0.25 or 0.125 mg in low-weight infants is used. Samples are obtained at baseline and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration. To evaluate for the different causes of CAH, levels of 17-OHP, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-OH-pregnenolone, DHEA, and androsterone should be measured. In small children, to avoid taking a large volume of blood, the basal sample can be avoided. Evaluation of CYP21A2 may avoid the need for a cosyntropin stimulation test; however, less common causes of CAH will be missed, and, therefore, a cosyntropin test is preferred.Pelvic-labioscrotal ultrasonography is part of the initial evaluation of patients with ambiguous genitalia. Laparoscopic evaluation allows for better visualization of the gonads and internal structures, and for a biopsy of the gonads if considered necessary. However, laparoscopy is a more invasive procedure with possible complications.Individuals with DSDs who carry Y chromosome material in their gonads are at increased risk for germ cell tumors, including gonadoblastomas, seminomas, and dysgerminomas. These tumors are seen in 30% of patients with gonadal dysgenesis, 17% with 17β-HSD deficiency, 15% with PAIS, 2.6% with ovotesticular DSD, and 0.8% with CAIS. Among patients with WT1 gene defects, malignancies have been reported in 60% with Frasier syndrome and 40% with Denys-Drash syndrome. (34)Gender assignment is a highly complex and controversial matter. In general, it is recommended to assign a gender to a child with a DSD after multidisciplinary team discussions, and in accordance with the family's wishes. Due to the possibility of developing gender dysphoria later in life, it is preferable to postpone genital surgery until the patient is old enough to have a thorough evaluation of his or her gender identity by a behavioral medicine specialist with expertise in this field. Furthermore, delaying genital surgery ensures that the patient is able to contribute to and participate in decisions about surgical procedures.To avoid gender dysphoria and all of its potential detrimental consequences, it is vital to discuss both the importance of identifying early signs of gender dysphoria with the child's parents, and the critical value of familial support of the child's preferred, expressed gender.Currently there are 5 main categories of DSDs in which gender assignment and, in some cases, surgical consideration for genital reconstruction, is necessary: 46,XX DSD, 46,XY DSD, sex chromosome mosaicism, ovotesticular DSD, and nonhormonal/nonchromosomal DSD. (25) Individuals with conditions associated with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with hydrocortisone at slightly supraphysiological doses three times a day, and with fludrocortisone if they also have mineralocorticoid deficiency. Salt supplementation is recommended in these patients to avoid higher fludrocortisone doses, which may induce hypertension.Treatment with monthly injections of testosterone cypionate or enanthate for three or four doses has been used on infants with micropenis and suspected or documented PAIS to evaluate phallic enlargement. This is a method used by some clinicians to help determine gender assignment. If there is poor response to testosterone, female sex is assigned; if penile enlargement is significant, then male gender is assigned.Hormone replacement in hypogonadism should be started at the time of puberty according to the assigned gender. Very low doses of estradiol via patches or oral micronized estradiol are commonly used in girls, and testosterone gels, patches, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injections have traditionally been used in boys. Progressive increments of the dose are used to reach adult hormone levels. In females, progesterone is added once they reach menarche, or after 2 years of treatment with estradiol. When no uterus is present, there is no need to use progesterone.The purpose of surgical treatment in patients with DSD is to make the genitalia as functional and normal-appearing as possible to allow intercourse, facilitate reproduction, reduce urologic complications, reduce risk of gonadal tumors, and avoid psychosocial problems related to atypical anatomy. (25)In 46,XX patients with classic CAH due to CYP21A2 or CYP11B1 mutations, traditionally, feminizing surgery was performed during infancy. Techniques for clitoral reduction with or without vaginal surgery have evolved during the past couple of decades, with positive functional results. Some teams prefer not to do surgery early in childhood, but later in life when the patient shows gender identity satisfaction. In cases of genital reconstruction during childhood, vaginal dilatation should be avoided until they become adolescents or young adults. (25)Among 46,XY individuals with 5α-RD2 and 17β-HSD3 raised as females and identified as females before or during puberty, testes can be removed if gender identity is clear, or puberty can be blocked until gender is clarified because they will be become virilized during puberty. In patients with PAIS raised as males, orchiopexy should be performed early in life and gonads should be followed closely for early detection of tumor development by physical examination, ultrasonography, and tumor markers. For individuals with CAIS, due to the low risk of gonadal tumors and the positive effect in terms of feminization, gonads are retained at least until puberty. However, although the risk of tumors is low, it is difficult to have an effective method for monitoring undescended testes. (35)Among 45,X/46,XY patients with Y material it is recommended to raise them as males despite the low chances of fertility and uncertain surgical outcomes. If male and female structures are present and female gender is considered, it is recommended to delay irreversible surgery until gender identity is established. (25) A streak gonad should be removed, considering the risk of developing tumors and the lack of function, and a scrotal gonad needs to be followed carefully. In individuals with ovotesticular DSD it is not recommended to remove genital structures until gender identity is clear.Children with ambiguous genitalia need early intervention to clarify their diagnosis, alleviate the anxiety that accompanies gender uncertainty, and, when necessary, begin lifesaving pharmacologic treatment. When ambiguous genitalia is identified, a multidisciplinary team approach, involving general pediatrics, neonatology, endocrinology, urology and/or surgery, genetics, radiology, nursing, and psychology, is of utmost importance. The general pediatrician or the pediatric endocrinologist should be the primary coordinator of care. The family should be educated that embryonic genital development is complex, and be advised that obtaining a definitive diagnosis can take several days. Gender assignment should be postponed until additional information regarding diagnosis and treatment options are available. Shared decision making is essential, taking into account family cultural and religious preferences, as well as expectations and perceptions of sex and gender roles.To avoid giving mixed or confusing information to the family, 1 member of the team should be delegated to communicate results and manage therapeutic decisions. Patient and family communication should occur frequently and in a calm environment with adequate time to address questions and concerns. Special attention should be given to the use of inoffensive terminology, and terms such as differences or variations in the genitalia should be used to avoid technical and intimidating language. For example, it can be said that \"your child's genitals look different than other girls or boys\" or \"some babies have variations of the common appearance of a child's genitals.\" The family needs to understand that the evaluation and management of these conditions is a long, ongoing process.Despite dramatic advances in diagnostic genetic laboratory techniques over the past decade, many cases still lack a molecular diagnosis. Given the highly complex and dynamic conditions faced by these patients, there remains no consensus on DSD surgery regarding indications, timing, exact treatment, and outcome measures. Identification of centers of excellence that use a multidisciplinary approach to care is crucial. This approach mitigates the anxiety that families can experience and avoids the risks associated with rushed gender assignment decisions that may not consider probabilities of gender conformity/nonconformity later in life.The ultimate goal of management is to optimize long-term quality of life by addressing issues related to anatomy, fertility, gender identity, physical and psychosocial development, and other physical, sexual, and mental health matters. This is best accomplished through ongoing, transparent communication between the team and the patients and their families, as well as by supplying tailored referrals to support groups for caregivers and the affected individual. Support groups can play a vital role in education, advocacy, peer support, and even obtaining necessary medical and mental health care.To view teaching slides that accompany this article, visit http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/content/42/8/414.",

      "abstract": "Sexual aggression in dating is now a widespread social phenomenon. The present study was designed to examine interpretations in a sexual disagreement situation within young dating couples. Forty-five heterosexual couples classified into one of three distinct stages of involvement were asked to complete several questionnaires requesting background and sexual information, and respond to six brief scenarios describing dating situations. It was hypothesized that the respondent's sex, couple's dating stage, woman's type of \"No\" response, and the level of intimacy were related to the following: a man's reaction to his date's refusal of unwanted sexual advances, and any future consequences to the couple's dating relationship. Results from MANOVAs and ANOVAs indicated that while many men, in general, would comply with a date's refusal, a substantial percentage of men would use some type of coercion to continue advances after a woman refused. Each man's compliance was found to be influenced by the particular dating stage and intimacy level in which he and his partner were involved. These findings indicate the dating situation is highly complex and susceptible to misinterpretation.",

Third, these norms, beliefs, and practices are continually influenced by the process of acculturation as these men try to adjust to life in the United States. The effects of the first two domains may vary by the degree to which a particular immigrant community remains socially and culturally insulated from the mainstream community.

      "title": "Woman and the masculine protest.",
      "abstract": "The contrast between the potent, aggressive male and the impotent female is so widespread that when anything gives a male a sense of weakness, inadequacy, or incompleteness, he seizes upon the contrast and begins to suspect that he is lacking in virility, a thing so unendurably disgraceful that his whole life becomes one intense, unremitting effort to prove to himself and all the world that this is not so. That is the and when one is obsessed with it, he soon develops the neurotic constitution--always determined to be the superior male, always tense and overbearing except when he is exhausted, and, of course, always subject to the physical symptoms that such a purgatorial life involves. When suspicion or accusation of inferiority leads to a protest in women, it is by no means always a masculine protest. An uncomfortable sense of inferiority is very common, indeed, with women. Its victims attribute it to a variety of causes. They care about all kinds of social relations; they want to be like other girls they admire; and their self-respect is not so steeped in thoughts of worthy masculinity that it is marked. The dominant thoughts and impulses of youthful human beings are more social than sexual, and their social ambitions are not all couched in terms of brute force.

      "abstract": "Vision is often an essential capacity for the interaction between individuals and their environment. Yet, for some individuals, an impaired visual system alters that opportunity. Visual loss can be lifelong, present from birth; for others, it can be progressive or abrupt. For some individuals, particularly those who lose vision later in life, the loss of vision is associated with a corresponding loss of independence, and impact on their emotional status. A lifespan perspective regarding visual impairment (VI) holds that the experience of VI since birth or early childhood is qualitatively different from the experience of individuals who acquire VI later in life. For example, in early childhood, VI impacts psychomotor and cognitive development that relies upon visual information processing and places challenges on the educational system, which must provide appropriate supports. In contrast, when acquired later in life, VI may place challenges on the ability to complete tasks of daily living, be independent, and engage in leisure activities, but not affect learning status or how knowledge is shared.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expresion. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppresion of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotesexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiences, of hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.",

Sexuality in fact includes the physiological, behavioural and relational aspects of human sexual life, which are variously influenced by psychological factors (e.g. sexual fantasies, desire, arousal, psychosexual orientation, and the choice of the sexual object), as well as social and organic (vascular, nervous, and endocrine) factors. From a functional point of view, a normal penile erection may be defined as an erection which permits the penetration of a lubricated vagina without additional assistance. Concerning the erectile mechanism, the haemodynamic changes in the penis require a high degree of central and peripheral nervous coordinated control and an unaffected endocrine system.",

      "abstract": "Context: Effect of sexual relations on mental and physical health has been the concern of the Iranian physicians, over a thousand years ago. Sexual ethics is one of the specific health topics of Iranian medicine archives. From the Iranian medicine point of view, because of different mental and physical differences in human, their sexual power and need for sex is different. It is necessary to observe the normal range, since the sexual indulgence causes different illnesses. Evidence Acquisitions: In Iranian medicine, different variables such as time, location, mental and physical situation, and also various forms of sex are discussed in sexual health. Safe sex not just reduces many mental disorders, but also prevents many neurological, digestive, urinary and genital disorders. Also, sexual indulgence is most harmful for health and causes stiffness, weakness and different diseases; therefore observing moderation in sex, according to the therapeutic characteristics and power, has been emphasized. Results: To have safe sex, it is necessary to consider time, mental, and physical status. Having sex when the stomach is full impairs digestion. Sexual relationship after heavy sports and severe emotional reactions such as anger or sadness, and after diarrhea or blood sampling is harmful. It has been recommended that having sex in temperate weather, and after evacuation of urine and feces, considering necessary arrangements, make the couple reach orgasm. Also, in the Iranian traditional medicine references, specific nutritional and health recommendations have been proposed for the sexually active people. Conclusions: Health care recommendations of Iranian physicians involve precious and new points for the updated scientific communities. Scientific revision of these recommendations can be promising for public health improvement.",

      "abstract": "The factors of the educational environment that have a depriving effect on participants in the educational process of both sexes in the form of unequal treatment, harassment, restrictions, exclusions or preferences, hidden or overt discrimination, any manifestations of gender-based violence have been analyzed in the article. At the macrosocial level the subject of analysis of gender deprivation in education is gender perceptions as a reflection of the state gender policy in general and the educational level in particular has been revealed. At the level of intergroup interaction there are gender stereotypes, at the level of interpersonal relations there are gender guidelines, at the intraindividual level there is a gender identity. Gender relations of participants in the educational process are considered as real practices and models of intersex interaction, determined by gender perceptions, prejudices, stereotypes, social rules, which are reflected in the minds of subjects. Gender bias is analyzed as social rules with negative and distorted content, as a prejudised opinion towards the representatives of one or another sex, which reflects the common norms of gender-specific behavior. Three components in the structure of gender bias: cognitive which is unreasonably biased, irrational thoughts about men/women in general or about their ability to be successful in some areas or unsuccessful in others; affective which means rejection, humiliation, underestimation, negative feelings towards members of one or another sex; behavioral which is connected with destructive, negative behavior towards them have been distinguished. The need to study the gender deprivation in education from the standpoint of different psychological approaches in the context of a comprehensive analysis of deprivation conditions, deprivation factors, the consequences of being brought up or living temporarily in such conditions and ways of their resocialization and integration into society in the process of socio-psychological support has been emphasized. The importance of systematic monitoring and finding diagnostic indicators of gender deprivation in the education system in order to prevent the deprivation of subjects of the educational process and create a gender-sensitive educational environment has been established.",

Research on health resistance has contributed two central reasons for the deliberate disregard or dismissal of health messages by reasonable people: one, a different definition or interpretation of health and health maintenance (largely encompassing free-will ideas) and two, a suspicion of authority-driven science, medicine, and government-funded communication. These findings ask questions about a strict adherence to a particular idea of human health and life, and a particular format of communicating these ideas.",

      "abstract": "Motivational drives guide behaviors in animals of different species, including humans. Some of these motivations, like looking for food and water, are crucial for the survival of the individual and hence for the preservation of the species. But there is at least another motivation that is also important for the survival of the species but not for the survival of the individual. Undoubtedly, sexual motivation is important for individuals to find a mate and reproduce, thus ensuring the survival of the species. In species with sexual reproduction, when males find a female in the appropriate hormonal conditions, they will display sexual behavior. However, some healthy males do not mate when they have access to a sexually receptive female, even though they are repeatedly tested. These non-copulating (NC) individuals have been reported in murine, cricetid and ungulates. In humans this sexual orientation is denominated asexuality. Asexual individuals are physically and emotionally healthy men and women without desire for sexual intercourse. Different species have developed a variety of strategies to find a mate and reproduce. Most species of mammals are polygamous; they mate with one or several partners at the same time, as occur in rats, or they can reproduce with different conspecifics throughout their life span. There are also monogamous species that only mate with one partner. One of the most studied socially monogamous species is the Prairie vole. In this species mating or cohabitation for long periods induces the formation of a long-lasting pair bond. Both males and females share the nest, show a preference for their sexual partner, display aggression to other males and females and display parental behavior towards their pups. This broad spectrum of reproductive strategies demonstrates the biological variability of sexual motivation and points out the importance of understanding the neurobiological basis of sexual motivational drives in different species.",

      "abstract": "In the early stages of romantic relationships, sexual desire is often intense, but over time, as partners get to know each other, desire tends to decline. Low sexual desire has negative implications for relationship satisfaction and maintenance. Self-expansion theory suggests that engaging in novel activities with a long-term romantic partner can reignite feelings of passion from the early stages of a relationship. Across 3 studies using dyadic, daily experience, longitudinal, and experimental methods, we find evidence for our central prediction that engaging in self-expanding activities with a partner is associated with higher sexual desire. In turn, we found that higher desire fueled by self-expansion is associated with greater relationship satisfaction. Self-expansion, through sexual desire, is also associated with an increased likelihood that couples will engage in sex, and when they do engage in sex, they feel more satisfied with their sexual experiences. We also demonstrate that the benefits of self-expansion for relationship satisfaction are sustained over time, and that the effects cannot be attributed solely to increases in positive affect, time spent interacting with the partner or closeness during the activity. Implications for self-expansion theory and sexual desire maintenance in relationships are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "Disciplining Bodies: The Aging Experiences of Older Heterosexual and Gay Men",
      "abstract": "This article explores ways that men in later life may attempt to retain or regain notions of youthful manhood-in particular, by disciplining their bodies through exercise or dieting. Sexual orientation is also a focus because it shapes experiences with manhood and with aging. Because heterosexuality is venerated and homosexuality stigmatized, gay men may experience old age differently compared to heterosexual men. Throughout paper, I draw on unpublished empirical data collected through intensive interviews with a group of fifty-two heterosexual and homosexual men who are in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. Interestingly, at least for this small, nonrandom sample of older, mostly privileged men, exercise and diet, health behaviors I explore in this paper, evidence no discernable differences between gay and heterosexual respondents. Both groups of respondents attempt to deal with stigma of aging bodies by engaging in fitness activities and body maintenance techniques that emphasize youthful appearances. Of course, relations of power shape relations between gender, age, race, sexuality, and body; variability in aging experiences is norm, not exception. BODIES, AGING, AND AGEISM While ways that people experience their bodies have garnered significant attention in recent decades, until recently, scholarship has largely ignored aging bodies (Calasanti and Slevin, 2001; Fairdoth, 2003; Katz, 2005; Slevin, 2006). Cruikshank (2003) also reminds us that despite body's critical role as a marker of age, even social gerontologists have given it scant attention in understanding how we experience aging of body, except in cases of disease and illness (Cruikshank, 2003). Tge researchers who have focused on bodies of people in later and even mid life have primarily emphasized loss of function; emphasis has been on a narrative of decline (Gullette, 1997). Indeed, because commonplace physical experiences with aging bodies are ignored, older people experience their bodies in an environment of profound cultural silence (Twigg, 2000, p. 115). Yet, story of aging is intimately connected with meanings we ascribe to our aging bodies. Indeed, these meanings are critical to making sense of age and aging (Laz, 2003). Laz (1998) also reminds us that age is an accomplishment, that it is more social than chronological. At same time, body has definite biological and physiological characteristics-bodies are more than social constructions-they do age and we do eventually die (Turner, 1996). Within literature on body, scholars have given little attention to empirically exploring accuracy of their broad and often sweeping theoretical claims (Williams and Bendelow, 1998). There has been little attention to the voices that emanate from bodies themselves (Nettleton and Watson, 1998, p. 2). With exception of a sizable volume of empirical literature on chronic illness and disability, embodied experience of people in their everyday worlds is absent. In our culture, growing old and being old are constructed as a problem, and we are now led to believe that not only can we chart paths of how we grow old, we can go farther and decide whether we do it at all. Apparently, technology has trumped biology; growing old has become new century's solvable problem (Cruikshank, 2003). Accordingly, widely preached exhortation to accept old age with grace is, in feet, no longer supported by practice (Gilleard and Higgs, 2000). Indeed, nowadays-at least in many Western societies-old age is seen as a pathology and stigmatized; more and more, it is viewed as a personal failure-one that especially affects those who lack requisite economic resources or physical abilities to partake of consumerism that surrounds aging (Katz, 2005). Consumerism touts desirable bodies as those that are young, toned, and thin; media convey to us that to be young and beautiful is to possess most desirable form of cultural capital. …",

Fifteen analytical categories were grouped together into the three dimensions of sexual scripts (intra-psychic, interpersonal and cultural).

      "title": "Nonhereditary Considerations",
      "abstract": "An animal's physiology evolves as it ages, so veterinary care needs to evolve with it. While every preventive care exam should include core elements regardless of a patient's age, there are additional components to consider as pets experience different stages of life. Regardless of age, all pets should receive regular preventive care. The frequency and components of each preventive care exam will vary based on life stage, but certain elements remain constant regardless of age. The four stages of life for the canine patient are puppy, young adult, mature adult, and senior. The six stages of life for the feline patient are kitten, junior, adult, mature, senior, and geriatric. Everyone – from client care representatives and assistants to technicians and doctors – needs to understand why preventive care recommendations are being made and should be able to discuss them confidently with clients. Gender can influence veterinary healthcare in a variety of ways. Some conditions may be associated with a gene on the sex chromosomes, some may just be more prevalent in one gender or the other, and others may be genetically influenced by mitochondrial DNA rather than nuclear DNA. Sex-linked traits are those that are transmitted on the X or Y chromosomes. Most DNA is found in the nucleus, but mitochondria in the cytoplasm contain their own DNA, derived almost entirely from the mother's ovum. In contradistinction to sex-linked traits, sex-limited traits are seen in one gender but are not transmitted on the sex chromosomes. Sex predisposition occurs when diseases are noted to have prevalence that are thought to differ between males and females. Normal sexual differentiation depends on a series of three steps under genetic control: the establishment of chromosomal, gonadal, and then phenotypic sex. Prevention and control of infectious disease requires an understanding of how infectious diseases are transmitted among pets. Infectious or contagious diseases can occur in dogs and cats and have a wide array of clinical signs ranging from a mild self-limiting illness to being life threatening. These diseases can be caused by a variety of pathogen types including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and parasites. Proper nutrition is essential to maintain health and a proper immune system in pets. All pets should have routine veterinary examinations and preventive care that is tailored for each patient and the geographical location. Pets should be kept in clean environments. Wildlife and rodents are reservoirs for some pathogens that cause disease in pets. Socialization of incompletely vaccinated puppies and kittens should take place only in environments where extreme caution is exercised to prevent introduction of infectious agents. Infection control strategies within small animal veterinary hospitals are implemented to protect both animals and members of the public from hospital-acquired infections (HAI). All small animal veterinary hospitals should have an infection control program (ICP) consisting of personnel overseeing the program, standard operating protocols, and regular training of staff members. HAI can result in increased patient mortality and morbidity, increased cost to owners, and can have public reputation consequences. ICP can decrease the rate of HAI and are integral to ensuring both patient and public health. Hand hygiene, when utilized correctly, will remove or decrease the population of transient flora present on the hands and can reduce the incidence of HAI. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and surfaces within veterinary hospitals decrease the risk of HAI, but when performed incorrectly or inconsistently, pathogens will remain and the risk of HAI increases. Prevention and control of parasites in dogs and cats is important to the concept of pet-specific care. Most pets will become infected with parasites at some point in their lives. This can include in utero, ectoparasitic infection, endoparasitic infection, or both – many of which may be zoonotic or involve zoonosis vectors. Parasites often cause one or more of the following more common clinical signs: weight loss, malnutrition, anemia, vomiting, diarrhea, and respiratory signs. Vector parasites transmit diseases that may cause fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, lameness, petechiae, neurological abnormalities, icterus, ocular abnormalities, epistaxis, muscle pain, and anemia. This chapter presents some common parasites of dogs and cats. It also presents some common vector-borne diseases of dogs and cats. Compliance testing reveals opportunities for the practice – this could be described as \"found\" business or business opportunity. Increasing compliance requires staff training and consistent messaging. Microorganisms maintain complex relationships with each other that may benefit or compromise their host. Recent technological advancements have helped the medical community to study the roles that microbial communities play in health and immunity. Early attempts to characterize microbial communities in humans and animals were limited to culture-based methods, which could isolate only a small percentage of organisms. The development of the polymerase chain reaction in 1983 revolutionized the ability to study the genetic sequence of nearly any organism. By comparing microbial communities of healthy and diseased individuals, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) investigators observed that key changes in microbial populations occur with certain diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and eczema. The HMP and other studies have identified several unique microbiome regions throughout the body, including the respiratory, integument, and gastrointestinal systems. Much attention has been given to the adverse effects of broad-spectrum antibiotic administration on the microbiome. Early detection is one of the core principles of pet-specific care. The early detection of issues allows the veterinary team to provide clients the most options for veterinary care, and often with a better prognosis than waiting for the condition to become more advanced. If the hospital goal is to detect problems early, when there are the most options available for successful management, then there should be plans in place for sensible early detection of problems in both dogs and cats, purebred, hybrid, and mixed-breed. Identifying problems when they are still subclinical may provide veterinary teams with the ability to change the course of disease. Screening tests can be breed specific, but also can be generalized based on the early detection needs of all dogs and cats. Laboratory expense is not a liability that needs to be controlled; there should be offsetting revenue generated for every test run. Veterinary teams strive to maintain patient health, and identify and manage disease. History taking and physical examinations are important diagnostic tools but laboratory tests are often necessary for early detection of disease. Reference intervals have been established for diagnostic tests to guide decision making and patient-specific care. They are typically reported in terms of means and standard deviations. Reference intervals are provided for diagnostic tests to establish if a patient's result is normal, high, or low. Retesting is an important diagnostic consideration. Panel testing is when a group of diagnostic tests are performed on one or more samples to facilitate disease detection or patient monitoring. Because pet-specific variations in hematological and biochemical parameters exist, it is important to establish baselines early and revisit them regularly. Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common conditions affecting dogs and cats. PD is the infection and inflammation of the tissues that surround and support teeth: attached gingiva, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, and the cementum on the surface of the root. Teeth with stage 1 PD involve only gingivitis. Teeth with stage 2 PD reflects early periodontitis, with upto 25% attachment loss (AL). Teeth with stage 3 PD involves moderate periodontitis, and 26–50% AL. Teeth with stage 4 PD have greater than 50% AL with extensive bone loss, tooth mobility, and compromised teeth. In most cases, PD is preventable or at least manageable to decrease long-term impact. A combination of veterinary examinations, professional care, and home care is the best strategy to provide optimal oral and dental health. Complete treatment requires general anesthesia. Dental radiographs are essential. Patient health is intimately connected to the environment. Environmental considerations are particularly valuable during comprehensive history taking. Environmental considerations are essential for the veterinary healthcare team, on whom the burden of diagnosis falls. The ambient temperature and humidity may challenge our patient's ability to maintain homeostasis. Heatstroke is the result of pathological hyperthermia. Hypothermia is a common complication of general anesthesia but it also results from prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Toxicological emergencies are common events in companion animal practice. Dermal exposure occurs more commonly in cats; oral exposure occurs more commonly in dogs. Several toxins cause neurotoxicity among companion animals, including heavy metals, such as lead. Pet-proofing the home is essential to keep pets safe because all ages, not just puppies and kittens, are at risk. Some environments foster disease including borreliosis, leptospirosis and systemic fungal infections. Dogs and cats require environmental enrichment. Although their environmental needs change with life stage, dogs and cats benefit from the opportunity to exhibit species-specific behaviors. Indoor-only lifestyles increase lifespan, but potentially sacrifice physical and mental wellness. Having a working knowledge of cats as solitary hunters, with keen senses and flexible social systems, facilitates healthy human interactions with cats. Cats have five environmental needs: safety, carefully spaced resources, predatory play, predictable, positive, social interactions, and olfaction-friendly surroundings. Cats may develop aberrant behaviors and compulsive disorders, such as feline hyperesthesia syndrome or psychogenic alopecia. Indoor living offers protection from the elements, predators, and automobiles. Outdoor living offers the advantage of freedom to roam. Indoor, indoor/outdoor, and outdoor lifestyles are choices that our clients make for their pets, with guidance from the veterinary team. Environmental enrichment is essential to improve the quality of a pet's living space, regardless of its lifestyle. Homeowner's insurance contracts are always split into two coverage sections: property and liability. All insurance companies require a completed application before they can quote or issue an insurance policy. After the application is completed and the insurance agent quotes and sells an insurance policy comes the underwriting process. Many insurance companies have made the decision to withhold from writing homeowner's policies for those who own specific dog breeds because those breeds have generated high claim payouts. Each company's dog exclusion list may vary as each company has differing loss experiences. Dog bite claims are the most common pet claims paid by insurance companies each year. It is extremely important for pet owners to understand the amount of liability insurance they have as well as the stance their insurance company takes on pet ownership.",

However, most of these have used highly selected samples, leading to the possibility that the results obtained are due to volunteer biases. The data analysed here consist of anonymous responses to a questionnaire on sexual behaviour and attitudes obtained from a large community-based sample of Australian male twins aged 18-52. Significant heritabilities were observed for a range of psychological and behavioural measures (orientation of present sexual feelings and fantasies, ever having been sexually attracted to a man, attitude to homosexual sex, number of male and female sexual partners), with approximately 42 to 60 per cent of observed variance estimated to be due to genetic influences in these variables. Familial aggregation was also observed in other measures (sexual behaviour in the past twelve months, attitude to heterosexual sex) but it was not possible to determine whether this was due to genetic or shared environmental influences.",

      "abstract": "A very wide range of sexual practices are available to adolescents. The options range from the socially approved act of absolute sexual chastity to uncommon ones such as group sex and same-gender sex. Many studies in the area of sexuality in Nigeria proceed from the premise that adolescent sexual behaviour hardly ever goes beyond premarital heterosexual intercourse whether it is voluntary, forced or transactional. Others are aware that other possibilities exist but hardly seek to document them. Thus, very little is known about the extent to which adolescents are involved in these \"unusual\" or atypical sexual practices. Using data from a survey of 614 sexually active adolescents in Lagos metropolis, this article fills the lacuna in the literature on the prevalence of atypical sexual practices in an urban setting in Nigeria. The results show that about 14% of the subjects had been involved in at least one of the two atypical sexual acts and about 1% had been involved in both acts. The study concludes therefore that sexual practices labelled \"uncommon\", \"atypical\" or \"unusual\" may not be as uncommon as people often imagine. Key words: Unusual sexual behaviour, uncommon sexual behaviour, adolescent sexuality, group sex, homosexuality.",

      "abstract": "The professional literature is replete with studies of the prevalence and type of sexual dysfunction in ESRD patients. Less has been published regarding the incidence of divorce or marital dissolution through separation. No information could be found on paticnt reactions to the questions of spousal fidelity. Throughout the last two decades, profound changes in mores and morals have modified societal views on fidelity in marriage. Two decades ago, marilal fidelity was considered a societal norm. Movies, television, and written &presentations overtly supported the concept of monogamy. Infidelity was not openly advocatcd or touted as a desirable way of living, nor was infidelity presented as a valid way of dealing with intramarital problems, economic or otherwise. We do have some evidence of a bipartite or double standard, however. That is, lip service to fidelity or portrayal of a public image of fidelity was the norm, while covertly, if kept quiet, sexual liaisons outside marriage went on without family or societal disapproval. Evidence for this view can be found in the Kinsey report (1948). This work investigated, by questionnaire, the prevalence of extramarital sexual activity among married men and women. Sixty percent of married men, and 40 percent of married women, admit",

Being a bully victim has long-term adverse consequences on physical and mental health and financial functioning, but bullies themselves display few ill effects. Here, we show that victims suffer from greater increases in low-grade systemic inflammation from childhood to young adulthood than are seen in others. In contrast, bullies showed lower increases in inflammation into adulthood compared with those uninvolved in bullying. Elevated systemic low-grade inflammation is a mechanism by which this common childhood social adversity may get under the skin to affect adult health functioning, even many years later.",

The sample consisted of 1021 participants aged between 18 and 75 years old (M = 32.68, SD = 8.79). A gender-stratified cluster analysis was performed to classify individuals regarding their scores on sexual boredom, general boredom, sexual sensation seeking, sexual desire, sexual excitation, sexual pleasure, and sexual satisfaction. A three-cluster solution was revealed for both men and women. Based on our findings, we put forward a profile for the sexually bored individual, who is more likely to be married or cohabiting with a partner, to have a boredom prone personality, to lack sexual sensation seeking, experience low sexual pleasure and satisfaction, and to present with sexual arousal and/or desire problems. Women dealing with sexual boredom might present low sexual desire for their partner but experience high sex desire for attractive others.

Outside of the postpartum period, feeling more satisfied with one's body is linked with feeling more sexually and relationally satisfied, with some cross-sectional evidence that sexual satisfaction mediates these associations. This dyadic daily experience study examined how new parents' daily satisfaction with their own and their partner's bodies relates to their own sexual satisfaction, and in turn, their own and their partner's relationship satisfaction during a vulnerable time in their sexual and romantic relationship-3- to 4-months postpartum. First-time parent couples (N = 240) completed 21 daily surveys. On days when birthing parents reported greater satisfaction than usual with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, higher relationship satisfaction. On days when non-birthing parents reported greater satisfaction with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, both parents reported higher relationship satisfaction. Evidence of bidirectionality was also observed such that relationship satisfaction mediated links between body satisfaction and sexual satisfaction. Findings support that daily body satisfaction is important for both sexual and relationship satisfaction among postpartum couples.",

Stories about romantic problems were four times more prevalent than stories about romantic nonproblems, and relationship instability was the most frequent type of romantic problem. Furthermore, discussions of romantic problems (versus nonproblems) were particularly likely to be softened or mitigated by projecting a detached, relaxed, or unknowing stance. Case studies of such conversational mitigation vividly illustrate how these primarily White, heterosexual, late adolescents conavigated the vagaries of developing serious and intimate bonds without appearing too invested or troubled by their romantic problems. The findings have implications for understanding the co-construction of social and personal identities.",

There are many aspects to this question over and above the legal aspects of such a person's rights, obligations, doing business, etc. What is the Halachic approach to a mentally ill person in general? Is this person subject to the code of Jewish law the same as the normal Jew? Should we make an effort to help this type of person fulfil the commandments and prevent him or her from transgressing them or perhaps since such a person is incapable of controlling his or her behaviour, there is no purpose in these efforts? Marriage and divorce are other serious issues to which the Jewish law gives special attention in this context. Marriage must be entered into by a rational and judicious person or the act will not be valid. A very serious problem arises when a husband is mentally ill and due to that halachically cannot divorce his wife and she remains an Agunah. The situation is more complicated as the definition of mentally ill encompasses a broader spectrum of cases. Which psychiatric disorders come under the definition of a mentally ill person who is unable to control his or her behaviour? Which symptoms attest the inability of a person to enter into marriage or to grant a divorce?

The action of coming out is not a singular event but an ongoing process that happens throughout one's life. The revealing of sexuality does not need to be done in a uniform or linear way and involves a spectrum of choices about how much to disclose, to which people, and in what contexts. The act of coming out is of personal and also political significance. On a personal level it can signify a need to be true to oneself as well as to brave external judgement. Politically, it represents the importance of acknowledging the need to convey difference as a collective action.",

For each of these schemas, we start from a given point (sexuality and its characteristics) and we look forward to reaching another point (i.e. satisfying enjoyment or making a child). We also encounter difficulties or conflicts in the given sexuality, in the symptoms, and then look forward to solving the problems and curing the sane person behind the patient. All these schemas can be represented with an arrow between two points: (given sexuality) ● → ● (full enjoyment) (given sexuality) ● → ● (successful reproduction) (given problems regarding sexuality) ● → ● (recovery of a sane sexuality) All of these schemas can be understood in the framework of a mathematical function. This leads from a point in a first set to a point in another set. My thesis is that this does not fit into the field of psychoanalysis.

Sexual response often is considered only in isolation as a reflection of good general health or relevant solely for reproduction. Yet, altered responsiveness to sexual rewards is evident in a number of affective disorders not limited to sexual difficulties. Sexual stimulation has been neglected for its potential to treat a range of general physical and mental health problems. Relative to other emotion sciences, sexual psychophysiology is underdeveloped. The chapter reviews how sexual responses are affected in general emotional disorders, then attempts to distinguish these, often unsuccessfully, from related sexual difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Background: Loneliness is receiving much attention in public discourse and through studies of its prevalence, distribution and relatedness to physical health. Consequently, much attention is given to interventions to remedy loneliness. Rarely is the concept of loneliness made the object of further scrutiny. Discussions tend to overlook questions such as what loneliness is, if it differs in type from adolescence to old age and whether it always demands intervention. The present paper aims at a discussion of the concept of loneliness with a focus on its manifestation among older single-dwelling males. Methods: A qualitative interview study was conducted with 39 men living alone in which they were asked about living alone, social relations and loneliness. Interviews were analyzed using a coping analysis developed by Munk based on Lazarus’ coping theory making it possible to identify what problems the men encounter, their meaning and how they are coped with. Results: Most of the older men living alone do not feel lonely. Secondly, where loneliness is felt it is typically of a particular kind related to the lack of someone with whom to talk over the day. Finally, loneliness is shown to be a somewhat ambivalent condition since the men’s attempts at alleviating it are also regarded as compromising their core values of independence and self-determination leading them to choose loneliness. Conclusions: Loneliness is a multidimensional construct not lending itself to simple solutions. It is necessary to consider the meaning of loneliness in the individual’s life if intervention is to be successful.",

Special attention is given to socioeconomic determinants. It is concluded that leisure satisfaction is higher for people who are older and have an optimistic outlook. They do not perceive a discrepancy between their actual and desired number of hours spent on leisure activities. Persons with a low leisure satisfaction are younger and have a pessimistic outlook. They perceive internal barriers (personal interest, capacity) that block them from spending more time on some leisure activities. Persons with medium leisure satisfaction perceive external barriers (time, money, circumstances) that block them from spending more time on some leisure activities. A tentative conclusion is that people from lower social classes more often belong to this latter group (medium leisure satisfaction), while people from middle social classes more often are characterized by a low leisure satisfaction. People from high social classes report most leisure satisfaction.",

      "title": "\"Developing Capacity\": Adolescent \"Consent\" At Work, At Law, And In The Sciences Of The Mind",
      "abstract": "No national consensus exists concerning adolescent capacity to consent to sex. The law gives differing legal significance to adolescent “consent” to teen-adult sex depending upon a variety of factors. In response to an increase in teen sexual harassment cases, this Article examines three subject areas that should inform the debate over the actual meaning of adolescent consent: adolescent development, adolescent sexuality, and child/adolescent sexual abuse. First, new neuroscientific and psychosocial science data suggest that adolescent physical and psychosocial development continue into the third decade of life. Studies reveal that adolescents’ activities influence their physical brain development and growth. In other words, adolescents “hardwire” their experiences into their brains. Second, statistics regarding adolescent sexuality indicate that teens are having sex that is not always completely voluntary. Moreover, parents are often unaware that their children are having sex. * Associate Professor of Law, Indiana University School of LawIndianapolis. J.S.D., Stanford Law School, 2000.

Finally, I am grateful for summer research stipends from Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis that supported this work. 2 UC Davis Journal of Juvenile Law & Policy Vol. 10:1 Finally, evidence demonstrates that child sexual abuse can permanently and physically disable youth. This Article suggests that the new scientific and statistical evidence should prompt law reform pertaining to teen capacity and consent. It concludes that while adolescents need to exercise their decision-making skills as they mature, they still need protection from adult sexual predators. As the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Roper v. Simmons suggests, we should not presume full capacity where science indicates adolescents are immature and still developing capacity. This Article recommends, in particular, that sexual harassment law should be revised to make teen consent to workplace sex with an adult supervisor voidable by the minor. Courts should find teen-adult sex unwelcome as a matter of law, when the minor alleges sexual harassment. This Article recommends a strict liability civil response to teen sexual harassment, whether or not the teenager once consented to sex with the adult supervisor. In accordance with this Court’s decisions in Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988), and Stanford v.

The transportation of gender role identity seen in transexualism relates to the two schemas, identification and complementation, by which gender role identity becomes established developmentally.

      "title": "Gender and Family Status Across the Life Course: Constraints on Five Types of Leisure",
      "abstract": "Abstract The family context is considered as it impacts involvement in culturally defined categories of leisure: active, passive, entertainment, social leisure and TV-viewing as well as total leisure are considered. How does family context, which varies across the life course, constrain leisure? Does family context have the same impact for men and women and for married and unmarried? These issues are examined for a subset of a national sample of adults (N=782) who provided behavioral data through multi-day time budget diaries. Using comparable samples of time from each individual, analysis of variance is used to test for differences in means. Family structure is examined as it constrains and facilitates various types of leisure. Women, and in particular, single mothers, are expected to be disadvantaged in terms of leisure time and involvement. Results indicate a more complex interplay of family context, gender-and-marital status and types of leisure. Women in general are not disadvantaged in terms of leisure time, although involvement in types of leisure vary for men and women. Family context often leads to higher or lower amounts of leisure. Post hoc explanations are often necessary, since predictions of differences between those not currently parents and parents were too simple. Models that take family development context and gender into account seem necessary to understand the constraints and opportunities for leisure participation. Résumé Comment le contexte familial, qui varie avec les années, influe-t-il sur la participation aux catégories de loisir définies culturellement comme suit: loisir actif, loisir passif, spectacles, loisir social et écoute de la télévision, et loisir total? Quelles contraintes impose-t-il au loisir? A-t-il le même impact sur les femmes et les hommes, ou sur les personnes mariées et célibataires? La présente étude analyse ces questions à partir du sous-ensemble d'un échantillon national d'adultes (N=782) dont les données comportementales proviennent de compte rendus d'emploi du temps effectués quotidiennement à plusieurs reprises. L'analyse porte sur la structure familiale compte tenu de ses nombreux éléments contraignant ou facilitant la pratique de divers types de loisir. Les auteures font l'hypothèse que les femmes, et plus particulièrement les mères de familles monoparentales, sont désavantagées quant à la participation aux activités de loisir et au temps de pratique de ces activités. Les résultats font ressortir un lien plus complexe que prévu entre le contexte familial, le statut sexuel et conjugal et les types de loisir. Les femmes en général ne sont pas désavantagées relativement au temps de loisir, bien que la participation à diverses activités de loisir varie en fonction du sexe. Le contexte familial modifie souvent à la hausse ou à la baisse la quantité de loisir. Les auteures ont souvent dû recourir à des explications postérieures à l'analyse, puisque les prédictions relatives aux différences entre les parents et ceux qui ne le sont pas étaient trop élémentaires. Des modèles permettant de tenir compte du contexte de développement familial et du sexe s'avèrent nécessaires à la compréhension des éléments contraires ou favorables à la participation au loisir. Resumen ¿ Cómo el contexto familiar, que varía según los años, influencia la participación en las categorias de tiempo libre definidas culturalmente como sigue: tiempo libre activo, liempo libre pasivo, espectáculos, tiempo libre social y escucha de la televisión como distracción total? ¿ Qué dificultades impone al tiempo libre? ¿ Tiene el mismo impacto en las mujeres que en los hombres, o en las personas casadas como en las solteras? El presente estudio analiza estas preguntas desde el punto de vista de conjunto de una muestra nacional en los adultos (N=782) en la que los resultados de comportamiento provienen del tiempo dedicado diariamente en varias ocasiones. El análisis porta sobre la estructura familiar teniendo cuenta de los numerosos elementos que dificultan o facilitan la práctica de diversos tipos de tiempo libre. Las autoras defienden la hipótesis que las mujeres, y particularmente las madres de familias monoparentales, están desaventajadas cuanto a la participación en las actividades de tiempo libre y al tiempo de práctica de estas actividades. Los resultados resaltan un lazo más complejo que previsto entre el contexto familiar, el estatuto sexual y matrimonial y los tipos de tiempo libre. Las mujeres en general no están desaventajadas en relación al tiempo libre, apesar de que la participación a diversas actividades de tiempo libre variá en función del sexo. El contexto familiar modifica con frecuencia a más o a menos la cantidad de tiempo libre. Las autoras han debido recurrir con frecuencia a explicaciones subsecuentes al análisis, puesto que las predicciones relativas a las diferencias entre los que son padres y los que no lo son eran demasiado elementales. Los modelos que permiten tener cuenta del contexto de desarrollo familiar y del sexo son necesarios para la comprensión de los elementos contrarios o favorables a la participación del tiempo libre.",

      "title": "Sex differences in social play: developmental trends in early childhood",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in play represent one of the largest non-reproductive physical or psychological sex differences and have been widely observed across taxa and cultures. Several aspects of play – including toys and activities, playmates’ sex, and play styles – differ between males and females in various animal species, including humans. In early childhood, boys’ and girls’ play styles are characterized by different behaviors and patterns of social interaction. Girls’ play is assumed to be more social, cooperative, structured and adult oriented than boys’ play. However, there is a notable lack of developmental studies in order to track whether and how sex differences change over time. The present study focuses on age and sex differences in social play by 2- to 6- year old children, when most children begin to experience peer social interactions. Crosssectional observations of social participation of 164 children from 16 classrooms in three French nursery schools were made during outdoor free play periods. The sample, ages ranging from 29 months to 74 months, was divided into four age groups corresponding to nursery school grades, with balanced sex-ratio in each group. Our results showed that, for both sexes, social play increased over time, while solitary play decreased. Although no sex differences were found in social play and interaction with peers, girls were systematically one year ahead of boys, and this induced successive sex differences in associative play, cooperative play and social interactions at some ages. Moreover, boys played solitarily more frequently than girls, especially when young. Finally, time spent interacting with adults also decreased over time for both sexes with no sex differences, even though the youngest girls spent twice as much time with adults as boys. Thus, important changes were found in social and solitary play during early childhood with a developmental gap between girls and boys. Our findings emphasize the need for developmental studies both in humans and animals in order to resolve conflicting results across single snapshot studies.",

The perpetrators of this crime take advantage of their position of vulnerability, trust, and power in order to commit child sexual abuse or attempt to do so for financial gain or other purposes. Given how similar the terms “child sexual exploitation” and “child sexual abuse” are, it can be challenging to distinguish between them. Children who experience child sexual abuse suffer grave consequences. It serves as a huge roadblock to growth and advancement.

      "title": "ATTITUDINAL DISTINCTIONS OF SOLO SEX ENGAGERS AMONG OLDER ADULTS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Solo sex gets little attention in the research on sexual activity of older adults as most studies frame definitions around partnered sexual behaviors. This does not reflect the reality of many older adults who lack active sexual partners due to death, dysfunction, or serious illness. When solo sex is included in studies, they rarely go beyond frequency. The aim of this study was to determine how sexually active older adults view solo sex, its importance, and attitude distinctions between solo sex engagers and non-engagers through survey research with a sample over age 60 (N=556). The majority (58%) of older adults engage in solo sex with men more likely (67%) than women (53%). As expected, solo sex engagers are twice as likely to use sexual toys and to be interested in using them if they currently do not. More solo sex engagers (70%) view orgasms as being extremely/very important for a good sexual experience than non-engagers (55%). Positive sexual outlooks correlate with solo sex as 80% of engagers anticipate an unlimited number of future orgasms compared to 65% of non-engagers. The most striking attitude distinction is 72% of engagers believe solo sex can be “great sex” compared to only 39% of non-engagers. Solo sex has psychological and physiological benefits for older adults and this study demonstrates solo sex correlates with positive sexual attitudes. The findings of this study highlight the need for further attention to the importance of solo sex for older adults and how it relates to positive sexual health.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Menschen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung zeigen die gesamte Vielfalt sexueller Fantasien und sexuellen Verhaltens ebenso wie ihre nichtbetroffenen Peers. Dennoch finden sich auch einige Besonderheiten in sexuellem Erleben und Verhalten bei Menschen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung, die größtenteils auf die störungsspezifischen Symptome zurückzuführen sind. Hierzu zählen eine höhere Diversität bezüglich der eigenen sexuellen Orientierung sowie des eigenen Geschlechtsrollenverständnisses, aber auch Probleme im Hinblick auf das Eingehen von festen Partnerschaften oder im Hinblick auf die eigene sexuelle Funktionsfähigkeit. Darüber hinaus finden sich bei manchen Personen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung (insbesondere bei Männern) Hinweise auf das Vorliegen hypersexueller Verhaltensweisen sowie paraphiler sexueller Fantasien und Verhaltensweisen. Bisher existieren keine empirischen Befunde, die nahelegen, dass eine Autismus-Spektrum-Störung einen Risikofaktor für allgemeine oder sexuelle Straffälligkeit darstellt. Basierend auf Fallstudien wurden jedoch einige Erklärungsansätze publiziert, die beschreiben, wie in einigen wenigen Fällen die autismusspezifische Symptomatik mit zu der Begehung einer Straftat beigetragen haben könnte, was auch bei der Schuldfähigkeitsbegutachtung Berücksichtigung finden könnte. Hierzu zählen eine fehlende Opferempathie, das Vorliegen kognitiver Verzerrungen oder defizitäre Kommunikations- und Interaktionsfertigkeiten. Straftäter mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung sollten individuell auf sie zugeschnittenen psycho- und pharmakotherapeutischen Interventionen zugeführt werden, um eine erneute Straffälligkeit im besten Falle zu verhindern.",

The various sexual problems encountered at this time are not so different from those occurring earlier in life, but in the final life-stage, they arise in a context of involution. Those not involved in relationships may still have problems relating to sexuality—changes in body image and regrets at never having reproduced are common themes. Consideration is given to the impact of a premature or surgical menopause and to whether ‘storm and stress’ in the perimenopause are necessary or functional for continuing sexual health into old age. The short- and long-term effects of oestrogen withdrawal and the option for replacement therapy are discussed, particularly in relation to the demographic trend towards an increasing proportion of post-menopausal women in the UK.",

However, the aging process does bring with it certain changes in the physiology of the male and the female sexual response, and these along with a number of medical problems that become more prevalent in the mature years, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the sexual disorders of the elderly. The typical patient over 50 has only a partial degree of biological impairment, which has, however, been escalated into a total sexual disability by a variety of cultural, intrapsychic, and relationship stressors. Fortunately, these problems are frequently amenable to an integrated psychodynamically oriented sex therapy approach that emphasizes the improvement of the couple's intimacy, and the expansion of their sexual flexibility.",

A Polish sample of 565 participants aged between 18 and 57 was tested. In females, regardless of chronotype, the greatest need for sex occurred between 18:00 and 24:00, but a secondary peak appeared only in morning types at 6:00–9:00. In males, the greatest need for sex occurred either in the morning or evening hours: in evening types at 9:00–12:00 and 18:00–3:00; in neither types at 6:00–9:00 and 18:00–24:00; in morning types at 6:00–12:00 and 18:00–24:00. Considering time of day when subjects were undertaking sexual activity most frequently, this appeared between 18:00 and 24:00 for all the participants, and prolonged until 3:00 at night in evening type males. Morningness preference was more strongly related to the timing of need for sex than to the timing of actual sexual activity (r = −0.275 vs. r = −0.174), while the timing of desire and the timing of sexual activity were positively, but moderately related (r = 0.320).",

It is typical of people of active reproductive age and, therefore, it can have a significant impact on the demographic dynamics.  The second trend is the disappearance of reliable specific differences between the average samples of men and women, which were previously quite pronounced in each gender’s profile. Theoretical assumptions about the possible causes of these phenomena are supported by a practical study of a random sample comprising fifty-six heterosexual couples. Both of these trends, each to its own degree, were found in the surveyed sample.

Similarly, although one-third of junior human siblings suffer physical, psychological, or relational aggression from siblings on a weekly basis, affecting self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety, interpersonal stress, and depression, rigorous studies found no effects on the major personality traits in adulthood: emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and imagination.

In rodents, mainly sexual hormones and pheromones, and secondarily sexual reflexes and reinforcement processes, would be the main innate factors at the origin of a genuine heterosexual reproductive behavior, the purpose of which is, at the favorable season, to achieve copulation permitting fecundation. It would seem that during evolution, owing to the modifications of the brain of rodents into that of Man's, the hormonal and pheromonal factors have become secondary, whereas the cognitive factors and the reinforcement processes (or reward systems) have become predominant. For these reasons, in Man, the behavior that leads to reproduction may be conceived not as an innate “reproductive behavior,” but as an acquired “erotic behavior” involving behavioral sequences of stimulation of the most erogenous body zones by a partner—no matter his sex.

There are many barriers to healthy expression of sexuality in older adults with dementia. Clinicians should be mindful that older adults remain at risk for sexually transmitted infections and that sexual risk-taking behaviour is not only a problem of younger people.

      "abstract": "Although the sexuality of older adults has historically been ignored by both the medical and research communities, recent studies have examined sexual attitudes, behavior, and experiences of older men and women. One important measure of sexual health is recent experience of sexual dysfunction or problems. Sexual problems tend to increase in prevalence with age, but not all older adults experience sexual problems. Some stop having partnered sex because of sexual problems, most often in the male partner. Some with partners are sexually inactive. Some without partners masturbate for sexual release. This paper explores differences between these groups, in terms of how each responds to questions about their recent experience with sexual problems. Considering response patterns to these questions, we argue that these questions carry different meanings for members of each group. We discuss these differences, and appropriate uses of information on sexual problems in both clinical and research applications.",

The most common type of ante mortem genital mutilations involves cultural practices such as male circumcision. Less common male mutilations such as subincisions are tribally based. Female genital mutilation is found particularly in African, Middle Eastern, or Asian populations. Self-inflicted genital injuries are most common in males and may be related to attempts at suicide, or to self-harming practices. The latter have a strong association with psychiatric illnesses. Postmortem injuries may arise from animal predation or deliberate mutilation of a corpse. The latter may be associated with ante mortem genital injuries in sadistic homicides.

      "title": "(290) Exploring the Link Between Conformity to Masculine Ideologies and Responses to Sexual Rejection in Cisgender Men and Cisgender Women",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexual rejection occurs when a person’s sexual advances are terminated by a potential sexual partner, leading to responses that may disregard the partner’s choice, such as attempts to entice or express resentment. Traditional masculine ideologies (TMIs) could play a role in motivating enticing or resentful responses. TMIs often emphasize superiority, encompassing power, control, dominance, and frequent sexual activity. When individuals adhering to TMIs face sexual rejection, they may experience feelings of inferiority and respond with enticing or resentful behaviors to reassert superiority. Objective Explore links between TMIs and the use of enticing and resentful responses following experiences of sexual rejection. Methods A German-speaking sample of 351 cisgender men and 345 cisgender women (age: M = 28.11, SD = 8.05) were randomly assigned to read one of two hypothetical stories in which participants should imagine being sexually rejected by their partner (rejection condition), or engaging in sexual activity with their partner (no-rejection condition). Afterward, participants had to report how they would react to sexual rejection. TMI was assessed with the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory. Results Compared to cisgender women, cisgender men more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .77, p &amp;lt; .001). Compared to participants who were rejected, participants who were not rejected more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .43, p &amp;lt; .001). Participants with higher levels of TMIs (being a playboy, dominating women, holding heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .18, p &amp;lt; .001; β = .15, p &amp;lt; .001; β = .11, p &amp;lt; .001, respectively). Compared to men with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation), women with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with resentful responses (β = .68, p &amp;lt; .001). This effect was reinforced through sexual rejection, as opposed to no sexual rejection (β = -.63, p &amp;lt; .001). Conclusions When sexual rejection hasn’t occurred men are more inclined to enticing behaviors. This tendency may stem from potential misunderstandings about desires and consent after initial sexual intercourse. Conversely, when sexual rejection does occur, resentful responses are more common among women adhering to a heterosexual self-presentation. Heterosexual self-presentation might align with adherence to traditional sexual scripts in which men are not expected to decline the sexual advances of a desiring woman. Consequently, rejection may be perceived as a direct challenge to their identity as a woman, triggering feelings of resentment. Therapists can apply these findings to better assist individuals or couples in their sexual relationships. By examining how adherence to traditional gender norms and scripts influences reactions to sexual rejection, therapists can help clients recognize these influences and promote respectful responses that honor all partners’ desires and boundaries.

No part of a newborn baby’s anatomy arouses as much interest initially as the external genitalia. Most newborn children have the typical features of a boy or girl, but in some cases the baby’s sex can’t be clearly identified. Infants born with ambiguous or abnormal genitalia may have indeterminate phenotypic sex.1 Disorders of sex development (DSDs), formerly termed intersex conditions, are congenital conditions in which development of the chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical and may affect up to 1:1000 individuals in the population.2&#x0D; J Shaheed Suhrawardy Med Coll, December 2018, Vol.10(2); 103-110",

Cluster 1 (socioeconomic and racial privilege; n = 239) was characterized by individuals who identified as trans women or cross-dressers, lesbian, bisexual, or questioning; had associates degrees; reported household incomes of $60,000 or more a year; and were non-Latino White. Cluster 2 (educational privilege; n = 191) was characterized by individuals who identified as trans men or genderqueer, gay, or queer; had a bachelor’s degree; reported household incomes of $10,000 or less a year; and were people of color. There was a pattern of individuals in Cluster 1 who identified with two privileged identities (identifying as White and having higher household incomes), whereas individuals in Cluster 2 identified only formal education as a privilege. Individuals in Cluster 2 reported statistically significant levels of anxiety. Implications of these results for future research and clinical practice are examined.",

The emancipation of children, the anxieties sometimes caused by the age of the parents, the lack of interest which society has in the 50 years old woman, but which it very readily takes in the old woman, conjugal lassitude, the lack of comprehension of those around her, very often bring such women to the doctor, who should know not only how to palliate the oestrogen deficiency, and the organic disorders, but also show evidence of a certain psychological understanding. It would seem that the role of the physician is primordial in so far as he, or she, is able to inspire confidence and explain the treatment prescribed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The affiliative interaction patterns of the immature members of a group of rhesus monkeys at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center reflected a strong bias toward matrilineal kin, although this effect was modified by age and sex variables. Association with kin decreased with age, particularly for males. Juvenile males showed less of a kin bias in their behavior than did juvenile females, especially for grooming. Juvenile males also exhibited a preference for interaction with other males. The diminished association with kin and the same‐sex bias may be reinforced in adolescence as adult males begin to aggressively target adolescent males involved in agonistic encounters with females or immatures. Adolescent males did not decrease their levels of social interaction relative to those of adolescent females; however, these males preferentially associated with other males (predominantly their own age‐sex class) and specifically avoided females and younger animals, both kin and nonkin. Avoidance may diminish conflicts with females or immatures which could result from association, thereby decreasing the potential for selective aggressive interference by adult males. Juvenile and adolescent females maintained strong ties with their kin and preferentially associated with other females and immatures. The breadth of interaction of females with other females may facilitate the establishment of dominance relationships as females mature. Familiarity and predictability may also decrease the necessity of more severe agonistic interaction.",

Yet inspite of a fairly smooth development in the motoric, perceptual, and other areas, her developing object relations were of a peculiar nature. The corrective device worn against the perineal area during the first year had surely aroused genital sensations, resulting in greater than average instability of genital schematisation.",

An instrument that contained items relating to eight aspects of sexuality (sexual feelings, sex education, masturbation, personal relationships, sexual intercourse, sterilisation, marriage, and parenthood) was developed and found to have good internal consistency and test‐retest reliability. Age was associated with attitudes, with those aged 60 and above holding more conservative attitudes. Parents and staff differed in their attitudes, with parents holding more conservative attitudes. This difference was the product of age differences between the groups; nevertheless it may produce some confusion for adults with intellectual disability unless it is addressed appropriately. Both parent and staff groups were less positive about parenthood than about other aspects of sexuality, however the community group did not differ in their views when attitudes towards parenthood were compared with the remaining items of the scale.",

      "title": "Self-Testing Among Transsexuals",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gender dysphoric individuals typically recount histories of prolonged conflict between their bodies and their minds to the effect that they believe they are born into the wrong body. Also, typically, they tell of an early onset of dislike and avoidance of activities appropriate to their genetic sex and affinity with and practice of behavior patterns appropriate for their preferred sex. The conviction that they are bom into the wrong sex and better suited to the opposite sex arises from day to day events of living: a so-called living test. Once accepted into a program of counseling leading to sex reassignment surgery, the individual is required to live in the manner of the opposite sex, e.g., a male believing he is a female is required to live as a woman for a year to two years. This is called the real-life test. The present paper describes the self-test and self-testing experience of many transsexuals wherein they, on their own, undergo circumstances that challenge their conviction: “I really am a male,” or “I really am a female.” Thus, a transsexual undergoes two or three types of sequential testing in establishing a final sexual identity.",

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. The same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

Injury is different from accident in that the latter cannot be expected and prevented, and also different from trauma that means the external forces on the body and the response against the force. Injury can be expected scientifically and prevented. The risk of injuries in children is closely related to the age, sex, socio-economical status, and environment. Injuries are always the most common cause of death in children throughout the world, and traffic accident is the most common cause of childhood injuries. Burn, near drowning, and fall down occupy most of the causes of injuries in infancy, and pedestrian injuries and traffic accidents are the major causes of injuries in pre-school ages. Suicide becomes an important cause of injuries in adolescents. Sexual abuse should be considered seriously in children with perineal injuries without definite causes. All of these childhood injuries are closely related to the status of growth and development of children.",

      "abstract": "Gay and bisexual (GB) men with prostate cancer (PCa) have been described as an \"invisible diversity\" in PCa research due to their lack of visibility, and absence of identification of their needs. This study examined the meaning and consequences of erectile dysfunction (ED) and other sexual changes in 124 GB men with PCa and 21 male partners, through an on-line survey. A sub-sample of 46 men with PCa and seven partners also took part in a one-to-one interview. ED was reported by 72 % of survey respondents, associated with reports of emotional distress, negative impact on gay identities, and feelings of sexual disqualification. Other sexual concerns included loss of libido, climacturia, loss of sensitivity or pain during anal sex, non-ejaculatory orgasms, and reduced penis size. Many of these changes have particular significance in the context of gay sex and gay identities, and can result in feelings of exclusion from a sexual community central to GB men's lives. However, a number of men were reconciled to sexual changes, did not experience a challenge to identity, and engaged in sexual re-negotiation. The nature of GB relationships, wherein many men are single, engage in casual sex, or have concurrent partners, influenced experiences of distress, identity, and renegotiation. It is concluded that researchers and clinicians need to be aware of the meaning and consequences of sexual changes for GB men when designing studies to examine the impact of PCa on men's sexuality, advising GB men of the sexual consequences of PCa, and providing information and support to ameliorate sexual changes.",

      "abstract": "Chairman McArthur: The first consideration of this discussion is: \"Who shall take care of the menstrual problems of the adolescent girl?\" Shall it be the gynecologist, the internist, or the pediatrician? My own feeling is that the pediatrician is probably the best qualified of all these specialists to handle adolescent problems. In the first place, he has usually known both the parent and the child for many years, and has gained a rapport of inestimable value in allaying the embarrassment of the patient and the anxiety of the parent. In the second place, the pediatrician has the developmental point of view. It is essential to treat adolescent menstrual disorders with patience and restraint—attitudes which come naturally to a specialist thoroughly accustomed to the vagaries of an evolving organism. If we examine the following list, which enumerates the various sexual characteristics in the order in which they appear, we see the relevance of the developmental point of view to problems of sexual maturation. It becomes evident that adolescence is a process—not an event. Because the first menstrual period is such a dramatic occurrence one is apt to think that it is synonymous with sexual maturity, the ability to reproduce one's kind. Actually, this is not the case, as we know from several lines of evidence. Thus, anthropologists studying the inhabitants of the Trobiand Islands have found pregnancy to be rare in young girls until one to 2 years have elapsed following the first menstrual period. In these islands, it is customary for sexual congress to take place freely from childhood on.",

We also consider cases where conspecific odors may amplify the threatening effect of aggressive displays among males to signal social dominance or ultimately influence mate choice decisions by female onlookers. Thus, sexual ornaments may function to attract or deter (i.e., threat) conspecifics. We suggest that males and/or females assess mate quality and discriminate among potential mates by using a variety of cues, including seasonal variation in steroid levels that relate to gonadal development.",

      "abstract": "A large body of scientific research documents four important gender differences in sexuality. First, on a wide variety of measures, men show greater sexual desire than do women. Second, compared with men, women place greater emphasis on committed relationships as a context for sexuality. Third, aggression is more strongly linked to sexuality for men than for women. Fourth, women's sexuality tends to be more malleable and capable of change over time. These male-female differences are pervasive, affecting thoughts and feelings as well as behavior, and they characterize not only heterosexuals but lesbians and gay men as well. Implications of these patterns are considered.",

      "abstract": "Conditions of life for women in the ancient world followed from one major fact and one major assumption. The fact is that women bear children. Menstruation, pregnancy, labour, and lactation are wearing and restrict activity; contraception varied (as it did until the 1960s) from moderately reliable pessaries and spermicides to mere superstition. But women do not spend all (or, for some women, any) of their lives bearing children. The assumption was that even when they are not doing so, they must lead a domestic life under male protection, for they are not suited to independence. Women were seen as more emotional than men (a question still in dispute), more gullible, more likely to yield to impulse or desire, less rational - generally less in control of their reactions than men are. Much of this, to modern observers, is self-fulfilling prophecy. If you restrict women (or unemployed men) to domestic life, they will lack experience of the world, develop compliance not self-confidence, and have too much time to brood.",

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse: What Rehabilitation Counselors Need to Know",
      "abstract": "Individuals with disabilities are at greater risk of sexual abuse. This includes both people who have congenital disabilities and those with acquired disabilities. Contrary to popular belief that young people with disabilities are protected from abuse and exploitation, there is evidence that they are, in fact, at increased risk for sexual abuse and maltreatment. In a British Columbia (Canada) survey of 16,000 high school students, 38% of those students with disabilities reported having been sexually abused or assaulted, compared with 17% of those without disabilities (Murphy, 1995). The fact that youth who have disabilities are at a higher risk for sexual abuse indicates that this area needs exploration by the rehabilitation counseling profession. Definition of Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse is defined as being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape. Child abuse has been defined in the literature to include any act of commission or omission that endangers or impairs a child's physical or emotional health and development. It may be evident by an injury or series of injuries appearing to be non-accidental in nature and which cannot reasonably be explained. The most frequent forms of child abuse are physical abuse, emotional abuse or deprivation, and sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of children involves someone too young to give informed consent but who has been involved in a sexual act. Exploitation of an individual who lacks adequate information to recognize such a situation or who is unable to understand or communicate (i.e., the child with a mental or physical disability) is also considered sexual abuse. This kind of abuse is a violation of the whole person and is not restricted to only a sexual act. It results in indignation and an overwhelming sense of violation and invasion that can affect the victim in physical, psychological, and social ways. Frequently, the aftermath of the assault or abuse is more severe than the actual event. This is particularly true of people with disabilities who cannot (or do not) access support systems and services that may otherwise be available. There is sexual abuse without touch, as when someone exposes his or her genitals or forces or tricks an individual to exposing his or her own genitals. Another type of sexual abuse without touch involves obscene telephone calls, as when an individual calls and talks about sex (e.g., ways they would like to touch a person's body or be touched). Primary affects of these crimes may be short-term but in many cases there is irreparable psychological harm done to the victim that can continue into adulthood. The nature of the sexual abuse also makes it difficult to observe and therefore more threatening to report. Professionals who work with people with disabilities need to be able to recognize signs and symptoms of sexual abuse. These symptoms include behaviors, attitudes, psychosocial aspects, and physical manifestations. Scope of the Problem It is difficult to estimate rates of sexual abuse among children with disabilities. One reason is that states do not collect data about abused children in the same way. A second reason is that researchers identify disability among maltreated children in different ways. Additionally, many cases of sexual abuse go unreported because these children do not inform anyone, especially when other family members are involved; parents often fear repercussions if the authorities become involved. Nonetheless, available research has found that children with disabilities are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than children without disabilities. A national study (Crosse, Kaye, & Ratnofsky, 2001) found that children with disabilities were 1.7 times more likely to be abused than children without disabilities. It is estimated that between 9% and 15% of all children in the United States have a disability; approximately 175,000 to 300,000 children with disabilities in this country are maltreated each year. …",

      "abstract": "People with learning disabilities are frequently denied or restricted in their right to express their sexuality by restrictive policies, negative attitudes or lack of awareness of their needs. They also tend to have differing and unrecognised sexual health needs to those of the general population. Evidence suggests that acquiring a greater knowledge and awareness of sexuality and relationship issues helps to decrease these disadvantages and to promote a greater sense of well-being for this group.The experiences of eight adults with learning disabilities attending a sexuality and relationship group, based on a mixture of validated and established sexuality and relationship programmes, were explored using a case study approach. Participants' experiences were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analysed using qualitative content analysis supported by participant observation and pre- and post-group assessment of knowledge.Participant experiences were unique and individual, with few shared opinions. All participants demonstrated increases in their total knowledge scores in the post-group assessment and felt that attending the group had changed their views on relationships; they felt that they were more able to talk to others, to trust someone, to feel confident to want longer relationships and to be married with children.Sexuality and relationship groups can offer participants a beneficial and positive experience to explore such issues. The experiences of participants could be enhanced through adopting a person-centred approach and through recognising that participants have individual experiences that may not be shared within the group environment.",

      "title": "Older married couples’ sexual expression: A dyadic latent class analysis",
      "abstract": "Many older adults continue to engage in sexual behavior, most often in the context of long-term marriages. Prior studies have tended to examine older adults’ sexual behavior, desires and motivations separately. Thus, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of the multifaceted-nature of older couples’ sexual expression. Using dyadic latent class analysis and data on 953 heterosexual couples in long-term marriages from Wave 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), we describe configurations of couples’ sexual expression. Four latent classes were identified. Within each latent class, couples were largely in agreement about their sexual behaviors, but husbands consistently expressed greater desire and motivation than their wives. In the highest engagement class, couples reported more frequent and wide-ranging activities (vaginal sex, oral sex, intimate touching), more frequent thinking about sex, greater satisfaction with their amount of sexual activity, and placed more importance on sex as part of their lives. In the lowest engagement class, both spouses indicated no sexual activity in the past year, but neither spouse was content with this situation even as both agreed sex was not an important part of life. Demographic, relational, and health factors were associated with membership in different classes. Health factors—especially sexual difficulties—were most predictive, with husbands’ health more associated with latent class membership than wives’ health. Given the complex and multifaceted nature of sexual expression among older married couples, geriatricians and other health practitioners should provide care that recognizes a wider array of activities and the potential for unmet need. Sexual expression is an important component of older adults’ health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Gay men in the New York City metropolitan area were interviewed from 1990 to 1991, during the period of the AIDS epidemic. Using an interview schedule, they were asked questions about “coming out of the closet” and other identity issues: their experiences of “difference,” beliefs about monogamous or “open” relationships, and their views about sex and commitment. The study's focus was on the men's “moral discourse” or their relationship to the “good,” including ideas of the self, other(s), friendship, love, sex, and commitment. The study yielded a consistency in the men's responses: they did not wish to impose on other gay men their own convictions about being gay, sex, and intimate relationships. Their talk was tentative, localized, highly personal, and “nonjudgmental” on a range of identity and moral issues. These findings are discussed by relating the men's life experiences to the gay culture they shared: their unwillingness to judge others reflects their own formative experiences of “coming out” in a society that judged gay men harshly and who, in later years, lived at the time of the AIDS crisis.",

This differs markedly from a concept of mental health as the absence of mental disease, for it centers on a positive goal toward which to drive, rather than a negative one from which to recede--progress by walking backwards, as it were. If one adheres to this positive motivation of mental hygiene, i.e. working toward an ideal, he finds an incentive to progress over a wide range of possible achievement; whereas to strive merely for the absence of mental disease leaves one unmoved by the larger wastage of unrealized potentialities and satisfactions.",

Marijuana not only interferes with the neurodevelopment necessary to meet these psychological developmental tasks, but it also confuses adolescents by seeming to accelerate maturation while actually delaying it.

      "abstract": "We wanted to describe the playful behavior of young children of both sexes from two and a half to six years of age who have been given a set of toys evoking motherhood. A girl doll or a boy doll was among the toys. Analysis points up two factors that allow us to explain the relative differences in behavior as noted in girls and boys while playing: The first factor is what we'll call the positive experience of mothering (girls play more than boys, older children are more involved than younger ones); a second factor, called a distant, defensive attitude, probably more closely characterizes boys with a girl doll (distance, aggressivity). The most positive \"mothering\" (various activities and outward tenderness) in a sub-group of older girls playing with a boy-doll. The doll's sex appears to be a determining element in child behavior. More general remarks are brought up regarding the theoretical questions of how the child perceives the beginning of the parents' role and how a sexual identity in the largest sense of the word are inter-related. The problem of a child's wants are also considered, inasmuch as they might come up in the cultural, social and psychological dimensions of childhood.",

      "abstract": "Psychopathy is characterised by profound deficits in the human tendency to feel and care about what other people feel, often known as 'affective empathy'. On the other hand, the psychopath often has intact 'cognitive' empathy skills, that is, he is able to describe what and why other people feel, even if he does not share or care about those feelings. Despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known about the developmental underpinnings of this psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy.The parents of N = 2760, 3-13-year-olds reported on the levels of empathy, callous-unemotional traits (CU), and antisocial behaviour (AB). Consistent with current theory and measurement practice, an index of 'psychopathic traits' was derived from the CU and AB measures.There are important gender and developmental differences in empathy deficits related to psychopathic traits. As expected, psychopathy is associated with severe deficits in affective empathy across all ages for males; however, no such deficits were found for females. Contrary to adult findings, psychopathic traits are associated with deficits in cognitive empathy in childhood for both sexes; however, males with high psychopathic traits appear to overcome these deficits in cognitive empathy as they move through the pubertal years.In contrast to cognitive empathy, low affective empathy does not appear to be associated with psychopathic traits in females. The characteristic disconnect between cognitive and affective empathy seen in adult male psychopathy crystallises in the pubertal years when they appear to learn to 'talk the talk' about other people's emotions, despite suffering severe deficits in their emotional connection (affective empathy) to others.",

Sixteen newly standing infants were video-recorded while standing and holding a toy and standing while not holding a toy. Similar to adults, when infants experienced a loss of balance, they did not drop held objects. However, maintaining hold of objects only partially interfered with the use of upper-limb protective strategies while falling. These results suggest that the tendency to maintain hold of an object while falling is present early in development and with little independent standing experience.",

      "title": "Knowledge of Adult Sexual Orientation Influences Perceptions of Adult-Child Interactions",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTChild sexual abuse (CSA) is a highly prevalent concern that carries lifelong consequences for the survivor. Many instances of CSA may be prevented when people correctly recognize precursory behaviors to abuse; however, research has shown that people's biases color their perceptions of behavior. Past research demonstrated sexual and gender minority adults are more likely to erroneously be seen as predators and face harsher consequences compared to straight adults. The current study examined how knowledge of adults' sexual orientation influenced perceptions regarding the nature of adult-child interactions. Participants in the current study read a series of vignettes describing interactions between adults and children where the adult sexual orientation (straight male, gay male) and the gender of the child (male, female) were manipulated. Participants then indicated whether they believed the behavior to be predatory or innocuous. Participants were less likely to recognize dangerous behaviors when the adult was described as a straight man interacting with a male child, suggesting that harmful adult-child interactions are more likely to go undetected in these instances.KEYWORDS: Child sexual abusechild maltreatmentsexual orientationadult-child interactions AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Jared Ruchensky and Alexa Callahan for their feedback on a draft of this manuscript.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Ethical standards and informed consentAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation [institutional and national] and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.Notes1 In the vignettes, sexual orientation was either described as gay/straight or homosexual/heterosexual. However, homosexual/heterosexual terminology is inconsistent with common descriptors of sexual minority populations. Therefore, we will use the term \"gay\" to refer to similar-sex attraction, and \"straight\" to refer to other-sex attraction in the current manuscript.Additional informationFundingThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.Notes on contributorsDaniella K.

      "abstract": "As a precursor to numerous psychological difficulties, dating anxiety is an important area of research that has been largely neglected, with existing research providing few answers concerning how this construct may present at different developmental stages of the life span, or across special interest groups. This article describes what factors may be important to consider when examining dating anxiety in adolescents, gay/lesbian/bisexual populations, ethnic minorities, older adults, and by addressing gender. Further research is necessary to address how social anxiety differs from dating anxiety, how these two constructs are similar and different across groups and throughout the life span, and how more developmentally sensitive measures of dating anxiety may be developed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The monogenic forms of structural sexual maldevelopment in human males are classified from the teratogenetic point of view. One purpose of this exercise is to highlight the unique features of human male sexual maldevelopment as an area for study by human teratologists. The uniqueness lies in three facts. The “organizer” of both the morphogenetic and functional components of normal male sexual development is known. Testes of sexually maldeveloped males can be studied prospectively and retrospectively because the testis functions prenatally and postnatally. Similarly many of the tissues “organized” by the testis prenatally undergo another round of responses at puberty. These features stand in sharp contrast to the prenatal transience and postnatal elusiveness of the critical events in most other morphogenetic systems. The biochemical knowledge of sexual development is advanced: it can serve as a chemical model for the morphogenesis of other organ systems. It is possible that various monogenic forms of human male sexual maldevelopment resulting from target‐cell unresponsiveness to androgen may be analyzable in cultured skin fibroblasts by the techniques of somatic cell genetics. Morphogenesis of the male reproductive system is susceptible to deflection by mutant genes that also produce nonsexual abnormalities.",

Childhood was partially delinked from age, and constructed with reference to a ‘nature’ that was revealed by encounters with the judicial system and articulated in terms of plasticity and hardness. By interrogating nature, child-correction professionals sought to differentiate the plastic child (that might be detained) from the hardened adult (that must be rejected or released). The hardness or plasticity of nature was reflected in the inmate's natal society, in the crime itself, in the punishment, in the response to punishment, in sexual behaviour and in the juvenile body. Between child and adult, in the 1920s as in the 1860s, there existed not so much a line as a process — a zone of discipline, investigation and uncertainty. The reformatory, along with experimental concepts such as adolescence and precocity, lay within this gap of productive uncertainty.",

      "title": "A complementary processes account of the development of childhood amnesia and a personal past.",
      "abstract": "Personal-episodic or autobiographical memories are an important source of evidence for continuity of self over time. Numerous studies conducted with adults have revealed a relative paucity of personal-episodic or autobiographical memories of events from the first 3 to 4 years of life, with a seemingly gradual increase in the number of memories until approximately age 7 years, after which an adult distribution has been assumed. Historically, this so-called infantile amnesia or childhood amnesia has been attributed either to late development of personal-episodic or autobiographical memory (implying its absence in the early years of life) or to an emotional, cognitive, or linguistic event that renders early autobiographical memories inaccessible to later recollection. However, neither type of explanation alone can fully account for the shape of the distribution of autobiographical memories early in life. In contrast, the complementary processes account developed in this article acknowledges early, gradual development of the ability to form, retain, and later retrieve memories of personally relevant past events, as well as an accelerated rate of forgetting in childhood relative to adulthood. The adult distribution of memories is achieved as (a) the quality of memory traces increases, through addition of more, better elaborated, and more tightly integrated personal-episodic or autobiographical features; and (b) the vulnerability of mnemonic traces decreases, as a result of more efficient and effective neural, cognitive, and specifically mnemonic processes, thus slowing the rate of forgetting. The perspective brings order to an array of findings from the adult and developmental literatures.",

One’s dignity does not depend on one’s parentage even to the extent of having been born of women or born at all. We normally ignore this and treat humanity as the deciding mark of personhood, no doubt because the terms are locally coextensive or almost coextensive. At this time and place human beings are the only persons we recognize, and we recognize almost all human beings as persons, but on the one hand we can easily contemplate the existence of biologically very different persons—inhabiting other planets, perhaps—and on the other hand we recognize conditions that exempt human beings from personhood, or at least some very important elements of personhood. For instance, infant human beings, mentally defective human beings, and human beings declared insane by licensed psychiatrists are denied personhood, or at any rate crucial elements of personhood.",

Many life style factors and occupational exposures can have substantial effects on fertility problems. Life style factors such as smoking, illicit drug (cocaine, cannabis), alcohol and caffeine consumption, exposure to extreme heat etc. have negative effects on functions of male reproductive system. In recent years, increase in disorders of male reproductive system may be associated at least some extent with these factors; which are enhanced by some of new emergent life style habits. A detailed study is required based on the data i.e., excess use of mobile phones and impact of mental stress on male reproductive health. This review highlights the role of various life style factors, environmental stresses and occupational exposures in male reproductive functions and their negative feedback in declining semen quality, increased oxidative stress as well as sperm DNA damages in male. Increase in reproductive disorder in male may be correlated at least in part with these factors, which are further added by some of new emergent life styles. Sub-fertile and/or even normal individuals have some control over their reproductive function by adopting healthy lifestyles.",

      "title": "Πολυσεξουαλικότητα και ταυτότητες φύλου",
      "abstract": "Η «πολυσεξουαλικότητα» αποτελεί έναν συμπεριληπτικό όρο που περιγράφει άτομα τα οποία έλκονται ρομαντικά ή/και ερωτικά από παραπάνω του ενός (κοινωνικά) φύλα. Μέχρι πρόσφατα, η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία δεν είχε στρέψει ενεργά το ενδιαφέρον της προς αυτά τα άτομα, αν και αποτελούν τον μεγαλύτερο υποπληθυσμό της ΛΟΑΤΚΙΑ2+ κοινότητας. Τα υπάρχοντα δεδομένα υπογραμμίζουν ότι τα πολυσεξουαλικά άτομα αποτελούν έναν κοινωνικά στιγματισμένο πληθυσμό που έχει συνδεθεί με συγκεκριμένους μύθους και στερεότυπα. Παρουσιάζουν διαχρονικά χαμηλότερη ευεξία συγκρινόμενα με στρέιτ και γκέι άτομα. Ακόμα, αντιμετωπίζουν μοναδικές προκλήσεις, καθώς συχνά συνάπτουν ερωτικούς δεσμούς με άτομα διαφορετικών σεξουαλικών προσανατολισμών, οδηγώντας σε περίπλοκα και – μη επαρκώς ερευνημένα – σχεσιακά δυναμικά που επηρεάζονται από το φύλο και τον σεξουαλικό προσανατολισμό του συντρόφου. Επίσης, σε ατομικό επίπεδο, δεν έχει δοθεί έμφαση στη μέτρηση εξειδικευμένων ταυτοτικών πτυχών που ανταποκρίνονται στην πολυσεξουαλική εμπειρία. Επιπλέον, υπό το πρίσμα της Διαθεματικότητας, η ταυτότητα φύλου αποτελεί μια σημαντική πτυχή που οφείλεται να λαμβάνεται σοβαρά υπόψη για την πιο ολιστική αποτύπωση της ατομικής εμπειρίας αναφορικά με την κοινωνική καταπίεση και την ευεξία.Η παρούσα διατριβή αποτελείται από δύο Μέρη και ακολουθεί μεικτό ερευνητικό σχεδιασμό. Το Πρώτο μέρος, έχοντας ως συγκριτικό πλαίσιο 2507 στρέιτ άτομα, μελέτησε την ψυχική ευεξία 291 πολυσεξουαλικών ατόμων, λαμβάνοντας υπόψη το φύλο και τον σεξουαλικό προσανατολισμό του συντρόφου τους, αλλά και βασικές ψυχοσεξουαλικές ιδιότητες. Ακόμα, μελετήθηκε η σημασία της Ταυτότητας Κοινωνικού Φύλου (ΤΚΦ) στο συνολικό δείγμα των 2907 συμμετεχόντων. Τα αποτελέσματα ανέδειξαν σημαντικές διαφορές τόσο μεταξύ στρέιτ και πολυσεξουαλικού δείγματος σε επίπεδο ευεξίας και ψυχοσεξουαλικότητας, όσο και μεταξύ πολυσεξουαλικών ανδρών και γυναικών. Επίσης, αναδείχθηκαν συγκεκριμένες ψυχοσεξουαλικές ιδιότητες που εξηγούσαν σταθερά τις διαφορές ανάμεσα σε στρέιτ και πολυσεξουαλικά άτομα σε επίπεδο ευεξίας. Επιπλέον, το φύλο και ο σεξουαλικός προσανατολισμός του συντρόφου είχαν σημαντική επίδραση τόσο στην ευεξία όσο και στις ψυχοσεξουαλικές πτυχές των πολυσεξουαλικών συμμετεχόντων. Αναφορικά με τις ΤΚΦ, φάνηκε πως τα άτομα που βίωναν την ταυτότητα φύλου τους με έναν πιο ρευστό τρόπο, σημείωναν καλύτερους δείκτες ευεξίας και ψυχοσεξουαλικότητας. Όλα τα ευρήματα αναλύθηκαν κοινωνιοψυχολογικά και μέσα στο πλαίσιο της Θεωρίας του Μειονοτικού στρες και της Διαθεματικότητας. Το Δεύτερο μέρος εστίασε στην ανάγκη της ερευνητικής στροφής στις ιδιαίτερες πτυχές της πολυσεξουαλικότητας. Με βάση σύγχρονο θεωρητικό μοντέλο, δημιουργήθηκε μια νέα και εξειδικευμένη κλίμακα μέτρησης ταυτοτικών πτυχών, η οποία στοχεύει να επεκτείνει την υπάρχουσα σχετική βιβλιογραφία. Πραγματοποιήθηκαν τρεις Έρευνες, με συνολικό δείγμα 325 ενήλικα πολυσεξουαλικά άτομα.

Ce questionnaire portait sur leur conception de la sexualité, leurs conduites sexuelles, leurs attitudes à l'égard du condom, leurs rapports de pouvoir et de négociation en situation érotique et leur participation à certaines activités de la communauté gaie. Il ressort que monogamie, non-monogamie ou rapports occasionnels interviennent sur les dimensions précédentes, dessinant des styles de vie relativement différenciés.

      "abstract": "Prominent theorists have made the argument that modern humans express moral concern for a greater number of entities than at any other time in our past. Moreover, adults show stable patterns in the degrees of concern they afford certain entities over others, yet it remains unknown when and how these patterns of moral decision-making manifest in development. Children aged 4 to 10 years (N = 151) placed 24 pictures of human, animal, and environmental entities on a stratified circle representing three levels of moral concern. Although younger and older children expressed similar overall levels of moral concern, older children demonstrated a more graded understanding of concern by including more entities within the outer reaches of their moral circles (i.e., they were less likely to view moral inclusion as a simple in vs. out binary decision). With age children extended greater concern to humans than other forms of life, and more concern to vulnerable groups, such as the sick and disabled. Notably, children's level of concern for human entities predicted their prosocial behavior. The current research provides novel insights into the development of our moral reasoning and its structure within childhood.",

However, each child is born with different challenges and peculiarity in the area of intellectual capacity. The condition could be present at birth as a congenital abnormality. An individual may be physically fit with no brain or body abnormalities and yet be mentally disabled. The terms mild, moderate, severe and profound are often used to classify intellectual disability. In view of this, it has been observed that poor motor control, high physical demand, fear of accident and social exclusion could limit the involvement of persons with intellectual disability in activities related to sport or physical activity.

      "abstract": "There are few psychometrically valid measures of exposure to social maltreatment that simultaneously assess sexism, racism, and anti-LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other nonheteronormative) behavior, despite the commonness of these phenomena. The Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale (SDMS) meets this requirement but is, as a result, somewhat lengthy (36 items). This article introduces a short form of the SDMS containing only half the number of items but generally retaining the psychometric qualities of the original measure. The 18-item Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale—Short Form (SDMS-SF) consists of six SDMS stem items (e.g., I have been disrespected, People made cruel or demeaning jokes about me) each of which is rated according to how often it had happened “because of my sex,” “because of my race,” and “because of my sexual orientation or gender identity.” In the SDMS online sample ( N = 528), SDMS-SF Sexism, Racism, and Cisheterosexism subscales were validated by confirmatory factor analysis and were internally consistent (α = .91–.95) and highly correlated with the original SDMS subscales ( r = .94 in all cases). All SDMS-SF subscales correlated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (mean r = .29), corresponding to a medium effect size. In all but one instance, related SDMS and SDMS-SF subscales did not differ significantly in the strength of their association with symptomatology. Together, these results suggest that the SDMS-SF is a reliable and valid measure of social discrimination, generally equivalent to the SDMS despite containing only half as many items.",

The basic questions here are: do changes occur in sexual behaviour, sexual interest or responsiveness during the climacteric years? If so, what are the variations and how are they caused? Two variables used extensively as a measure of sexuality are coital frequency and orgasmic frequency. Kinsey et al. (1953) showed that the degree of sexual activity remained fairly constant in unmarried women up to 55 years of age. By contrast, sexual activity in unmarried men declined gradually from puberty onwards. For married men and women they found that the frequency of sexual outlets declined during the life span. Kinsey et al. emphasized that the decreasing frequency of sexual intercourse and orgasm in marriage does not prove that the sexual capacity of the woman is influenced by her own ageing but could instead be a result of her husband's ageing. These authors were of the opinion that there is little evidence of any ageing in the sexual capacity of the female until late in her life.",

Unprotected sexual behavior between gay men evokes powerful feelings as the AIDS epidemic continues to expand. Simple notions of unprotected sex as self-destructive belie the complex and varied meanings of sexual behavior in men who grow up in a homophobic and alienating society. The very concept of risk-taking as pathological, rather than a manifestation of self-care, must be examined in a cultural and social context. Therapists have an obligation to look beyond formulaic interpretations of behavior to help gay men understand whether engaging in unprotected sex is a reasonable calculated risk in the interest of psychological and spiritual self care, or a consequence of some internal struggle or unmet needs which are indeed destructive of the self.",

      "title": "Explaining financial and prosocial biases in favor of attractive people: Interdisciplinary perspectives from economics, social psychology, and evolutionary psychology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Financial and prosocial biases in favor of attractive adults have been documented in the labor market, in social transactions in everyday life, and in studies involving experimental economic games. According to the taste-based discrimination model developed by economists, attractiveness-related financial and prosocial biases are the result of preferences or prejudices similar to those displayed toward members of a particular sex, racial, ethnic, or religious group. Other explanations proposed by economists and social psychologists maintain that attractiveness is a marker of personality, intelligence, trustworthiness, professional competence, or productivity. Evolutionary psychologists have argued that attractive adults are favored because they are preferred sexual partners. Evidence that stereotypes about attractive people are causally related to financial or prosocial biases toward them is weak or nonexistent. Consistent with evolutionary explanations, biases in favor of attractive women appear to be more consistent or stronger than those in favor of attractive men, and biases are more consistently reported in interactions between opposite-sex than same-sex individuals. Evolutionary explanations also account for increased prosocial behavior in situations in which attractive individuals are simply bystanders. Finally, evolutionary explanations are consistent with the psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes that occur when individuals are exposed to potential mates, which facilitate the expression of courtship behavior and increase the probability of occurrence of mating. Therefore, multiple lines of evidence suggest that mating motives play a more important role in driving financial and prosocial biases toward attractive adults than previously recognized.",

      "title": "Sexting Behaviors and Fear of Missing Out Among Young Adults",
      "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO) creates a strong urge to stay continuously connected and informed about peers’ activities, identified as a risk factor for problematic social media use and risky behaviors. Sexting is generally defined as the exchange of sexually suggestive or explicit photos, videos, or text messages through cell phones or other technologies. Despite its social relevance, the link between FoMO and sexting remains underexplored. This study examines their relationship in young adults—an understudied group compared to adolescents—while controlling for age, sex, and sexual orientation. The study surveyed 911 Italian young adults (18–30 years, Mage = 22.3, SDage = 2.57, 74% women, 70.4% heterosexual) through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that FoMO predicts only risky sexting behaviors (sexting under substance use and sexting for emotion regulation) while not influencing experimental sexting (sending one’s own sexts). Additionally, the link between FoMO and sexting for emotion regulation is stronger among LGB individuals. Therefore, FoMO has proven to be strongly related to the two kinds of risky sexting but not to experimental sexting. Understanding this relationship can inform prevention and intervention programs on relationships, online communication, and sexting in young adults.",

This clinical study with 30 middle-years couples provides some preliminary hypotheses and tentative conceptualizations. The outstanding characteristic of these couples is that they devoted little time or energy to their marital and sexual relationships. A dysfunctional or dissatisfied sexual relationship can undermine and devitalize the marital relationship. An alternative conceptualization of the role sexuality plays in middle years marriages is presented. The functions of sexuality include: 1) A shared pleasure which serves as a reinforcer; 2) Being emotionally closer and more intimate; and 3) As a tension reducer.",

      "abstract": "Gender norms can lead men to shy away from traditionally female roles and occupations in communal HEED domains (Healthcare, Early Education, Domestic sphere) that do not fit within the social construct of masculinity. But to what extent do men underestimate the degree to which other men are accepting of men in these domains? Building on research related to social norms and pluralistic ignorance, the current work investigated whether men exhibit increased communal orientations when presented with the true norms regarding men's communal traits and behaviors versus their perceived faulty norms. Study 1 (N = 64) revealed that young Belgian men indeed perceive their peers to hold more traditional norms regarding communal and agentic traits than their peers actually hold. Study 2 (N = 319) presented young Belgian men with the data collected in Study 1 to manipulate exposure to men's actual normative beliefs (i.e., what men truly think), their perceived norms (i.e., what men believe other men think), or a no information control. When men were presented with actual rather than perceived norms, they altered their own self-descriptions, future behavioral intentions, and broader gender-related social attitudes in a more communal direction. In particular, men who were presented with information about men's actual beliefs regarding the compatibility between communal and agentic traits exhibited the strongest movement towards a more communal orientation. The findings show that participants in conditions that uncover pluralistic ignorance adapted their attitudes and behaviors to be more in line with the actual norm: adopting a more communal self-concept, having lower intentions to hide future communal engagement, and supporting more progressive gender-related social change. The results are discussed in terms of influences of norms on men's communal orientations and broader attitudes towards gender-related social change, and the down-stream implications for increased gender-equality in HEED domains where men remain highly underrepresented.",

      "title": "Re: Sexual Harassment",
      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is widespread and prolific across the human race, mostly of females by males. It is a spectrum, from the worst of criminal behaviour (e.g. rape and murder of strangers, of women and girls) to what might be considered harmless playful banter between the sexes from later childhood and ever after. It does not occur in infancy, and appears to begin as a ‘learned’ phenomenon from later childhood. In his editorial, Isaacs considers sexual harassment occurring of women within our own profession, recognising that almost all examples of sexual harassment involve bullying, abuse of power and greater physical strength by males, often leading to emotional and/or physical harms.1 He does not mention the biological differences between the sexes.1 While sexual harassment is apparently learned, not innate, pre-pubertal boys and men are more aggressive than females, have more accidents and commit more violent crimes. While biological differences make males more often the initiators of sexual advances, they are no excuse for predatory or inappropriate behaviour, but any improvements will need to take these differences into account. Isaacs does not mention the importance of co-factors,1 the worst of which is alcohol. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is relevant in both promoting and facilitating abuse, and any solution will need to take alcohol into account. Isaacs advocates greater fight-back by women and better behaviour by men.1 In truth, we really do not know what to do to prevent sexual harassment, but whatever it is, it needs to be on multiple fronts. We must start with teaching children, especially boys, that sexual harassment is unacceptable, like all bullying. As is clear from public health improvements, for example seat belts, pool fences and reducing drink driving, both active measures (sanctions) and passive measures (advocacy) will have to be used.",

The logistical difficulties of following up people for prolonged periods may only partially explain this gap in our knowledge. Another explanation is that most developmental researchers have not yet themselves reached old age.

Erik Erikson, the 95-year-old grandfather of the empirical study of normal development, is in a unique position to fill this gap in psychological research. Along with his wife and a younger colleague, he had followed up a group first encountered as parents of children studied developmentally since the 1930s.

Every person on this planet have felt or experienced sexual desire or got engage in sexual activities. Many parts of the brain are involved in generating a cascade of sexual events within the body but Limbic System plays a primary role in the initiation of sexual drive/ desire. When a person gets attracted towards someone these parts of the brain become active and induce sexual desire, this is a normal body response, but sometimes these parts become hyperactive and sexual desire is uncontrollable such condition is termed as “Hyper sexuality”. In Pakistan, live-in relationships are not very common, so mostly unmarried individuals are involved in sex addiction. This study revolves around the increasing rate of compulsive sexual behavior in youth. A random survey has been conducted with approximately equal number of male and female participants. Subjects belong to the age group from 16-25 years. Almost 200 subjects have participated in this study. Exclusion criteria was above 25 years and below 16 years. People with any other neurological or psychological disorders were excluded. Approximately a 70% of the subjects were found to be on the track of getting hyper sexuality disorder and 15% of them were suffering from this disorder. This is the high time to break the barriers.

      "title": "The interplay of sexual orientation, social discrimination, and legislation: A consensus yet awaited!",
      "abstract": "If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be underlying theme of the Indian Constitution it is that of \"inclusiveness.\"[1] Definitions/concepts At the outset, for clarity of understanding the aforementioned discussion, we would like to briefly touch upon the terms and phrases being used/discussed here. As per the American Psychological Association,[2] LGBT stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. The \"LGB\" in this term refers to sexual orientation. Sexual orientation has been defined as an often enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions of men to women or women to men (heterosexual), of women to women or men to men (homosexual), or by men or women to both sexes (bisexual). It also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions and behaviors. Some people who have same-sex attractions or relationships may identify as \"queer,\" or, for a range of personal, social, or political reasons, may choose not to self-identify with these or any labels. The \"T\" in LGBT stands for transgender or gender nonconforming and is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity or gender expression does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Some who do not identify as either male or female prefer the term \"genderqueer.\" While it is important to understand that sexual orientation and gender identity are not the same thing, they do both reflect differing forms of gender norm transgression and share an intertwined social and political history.[2] Historical Background Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) (Section 377. Unnatural offences.—Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine) has been considerably debated in the last two decades. This section, which criminalized same-sex relationship, was introduced by Lord Macaulay in 1860 in British India. Historically, Common Law in England (Fleta, 1290 and Britton, 1300) was the first legislature to consider sodomy as a crime, the punishment for which was to burn alive such individual. In 1563, under Queen Elizabeth-I, the punishment changed to death by hanging, but it was not until 1861 that the death penalty was abolished. Sodomy, however, continued to be a crime in England until 1967 when the Sexual Offences Act, 1967, decriminalized the acts of sodomy between consenting adults.[1] Fifty years since then, many countries have adapted laws to decriminalize nonheterosexual sexual relationship and some have even allowed same-sex marriage. There are certain peculiarities of Section 377, IPC. First, it uses the expression \"carnal intercourse\" instead of the term \"sexual intercourse\" used in Section 375 (Rape) and Section 497 (Adultery). Second, no distinction regarding age is made in the section. Third, consent is no defense to an offence under Section 377. It has been contended that Section 377 is based on archaic religious moral and ethical standards which consider sex as merely a functional activity – for procreation purpose only. Thus, nonprocreative sex is viewed as \"carnal,\" i.e., for pleasure of senses. Criminalization of a consensual and private same-sex conduct has been a weapon for police for abuse including locking-up, extortion, intimidation, harassment, payment of hush money, and forced sex. Apart from victimization of homosexuals, the section also perpetuates negative and discriminatory attitude toward same-sex relationship. As per estimates for the year 2006, in India, about 25 lakh men practice homosexuality.[3] Section 377 has being argued to be a roadblock in identification, prevention, and treatment of those with sexually transmitted diseases, particularly the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Psychosocial Aspects Psychological investigations in people with homosexual orientation do not show any objective impairment or dysfunction in judgment, stability, or vocational abilities.[4] Mental health-related classification systems of the World Health Organization and American Psychiatric Association also do not deem homosexuality as a disorder. Regrettably, homosexuality continues to be stigmatized due to which nonheterosexual individuals experience chronic stress. Minority stress theory[5] hypothesizes three processes, in addition to universal stressors, that compromise the psychological well-being of nonheterosexual individuals: (1) institutionalized discrimination and directly experienced prejudices, (2) expectation of victimization/rejection and the efforts to avert them, and (3) internalization of stigma (internalized homophobia). Multiple studies across the world have shown increased rates of depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use and abuse, suicidal ideation and attempts, and suicides as well as other comorbid psychiatric disorders in homosexual men.[6] In a community-based study, nearly one-third of nonheterosexual individuals met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder and/or reported suicide attempt.[7] In addition, there are sufficient data to show that a significant number of LGBT students regularly experience bullying at school; end up homeless; are more likely to contemplate or attempt suicide; and the LGBT community has elevated rates of poverty, food insecurity, and joblessness compared to the general population.[8] Indian Scenario However, from India, there is a paucity of literature on the prevalence and the emotional problems faced by individuals with homosexual orientation, primarily due to lack of generation of systematic data.[4] In their editorial of 2012, Rao and Jacob[4] had highlighted the lack of clear understanding and stand by the Indian mental health professionals on the issue of homosexuality and LGBT. However, in 2014, the Indian Psychiatric Society acknowledged that homosexuality is neither a mental illness nor a disease.[9] More recently, the Indian Psychiatric Society in collaboration with the Bombay Psychiatric Society arranged the first conference in Mumbai on March 10, 2018, to address mental health issues faced by LGBT community, in which the President of Indian Psychiatric Society Dr. Ajit Bhide discussed the sexual identity issues of LGBT community. The aim of this conference was to \"positively impact LGBT community by being better equipped to help them.\"[10] The Legal Aspects Background It was on July 8, 2001, that the police raided the Lucknow premises of Bharosa Trust, an nongovernmental organization working for LGBT rights; beat up; and arrested Mr. Arif Jafar, the Director and his four colleagues, and seized literature on gender, sexuality, safe sex, and a large amount of condoms as evidence of a gay sex racket being run from there (which was actually a training material on how to reach out to the vulnerable men having sex with men). The lower court denied bail to Mr. Jafar on the grounds of promoting homosexuality under Section 377 and criminal conspiracy, and he had to spend 47 days in custody before granted relief by Allahabad High Court.[11] Thereafter From a legal standpoint, Section 377 IPC has been argued to impinge upon basic freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India, including the Right to Equality (Article 14), nondiscrimination (Article 15), and Right to Life (Article 21). It is understandable that no aspect of an individual is more private than sexual relations and hence criminalization of sexual preference is a violation of right to privacy under Article 21. In 2007, a group of human right experts formed the Yogyakarta Principles with the idea of equal application of human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender equality.[12] They defined sexual orientation as an individual's capacity for profound emotional, affectional, and sexual attraction to, and intimate and gender relation with, individuals of the different gender or the same gender or more than one gender. The principles recognize that human beings of all sexual orientation and gender identities are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights and that all persons are entitled to right to privacy, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. When this section was challenged on in the honorable High Court of Delhi, the Union of India filed two separate affidavits, both of which contradicted each other.[1] In an affidavit filed on behalf of the Under Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, it was asserted that indeed this section prevented high-risk groups from revealing their same-sex behavior. This resulted in a large section of population with HIV/AIDS being unreachable, thereby pushing the cases of infection underground and making it difficult for public health workers to even access them. On the other hand, the Director (Judicial) in the Ministry of Home Affairs felt that Section 377 was required as it was the only tool for the prosecution of perpetrators of child sexual abuse. It further argued that the society has not yet shown readiness or willingness to accept homosexuality. After going through scientific and medical literatures, international law, and judgments of superior court, in a historic judgment, the honorable High Court of Delhi declared that Section 377 IPC does violate the right to dignity and privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the constitution.[1] It also pointed out that India is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 17 of which states \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home and correspondence, not to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.\" However, this decision was overturned by a two-judge bench of the honorable Supreme Court of India in 2013 on the ground that it is the responsibility of the parliament to bring in a suitable law in order to enact changes in Section 377. It also observed that the section affected only a miniscule percentage of population and that, since 1860, only 200 individuals were prosecuted under it. With regard to misuse of the law, the Supreme Court observed that just because the police is misusing the law does not make the law invalid.[13] It must be noted that the challenge to the Delhi High Court verdict had not come from the Government of India but from private individuals. In fact, the government worked to pass the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, which it achieved in 2012. The Act criminalized any form of sexual assault on children up to the age of 18 years, thereby reducing the ambit of Section 377 to adults. Political will can also be noted in ministers' addresses. Speaking on the sidelines of the 17th International Conference on AIDS, the then Health Minister said that a proposal for decriminalization of Section 377 was under consideration by the Government of India.[14] In June 2008, the then Prime Minister in his remarks on the release of the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia said \"We should work to remove legislative barriers that hinder access of high-risk groups to services. The fact that many of the vulnerable social groups, be they sex workers or homosexuals or drug users, face great social prejudice has made the task of identifying AIDS victims and treating them very difficult.\"[15] A parliamentarian, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, also made two attempts to present a private member's bill with regard to decriminalization of homosexuality which was not taken up by the legislatures.[16] Last year, a nine-judge bench of the honorable Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice, in its judgment regarding privacy as a fundamental right, declared that sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy and discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation which is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. It further stated that miniscule fraction of the country's population that constitutes the LGBT community is not a sustainable basis to deny them the right to privacy.[17] This remarkable judgment on privacy has provided the much-needed opportunity to revisit the honorable Supreme Court judgment of 2013. Current scenario On April 27, 2018, Mr. Arif Jafar, Director, Bharosa Trust, filed a writ petition in the honorable Supreme Court where he has sought scrapping of Section 377. His petition has received impetus as it has been tagged with similar pleas by prominent individuals, namely, journalist and noted LGBT activist Ashok Row Kavi; Executive Director of Lalit Group of Hotels Keshav Suri; businesswoman Ayesha Kapur; Bharatnatyam dancer and recipient of 2014 Sangeet Natak Akademi award Navtej Singh Johar; well-known journalist Sunil Mehra; noted chef, author, restaurateur, and TV personality Ritu Dalmia; and hotelier, writer, and historian Aman Nath. These combined petitions have been placed before a constitution bench, and the honorable Supreme Court has already issued notice to the Government of India, seeking its views on legalizing homosexuality.[11] A Corollary… It may be recollected that section 309 IPC, which criminalizes suicide attempt, had also been a subject of debate in jurisprudence. Health-care professionals wanted the said clause to be removed as it hindered accesses to mental health services. The law enforcement agency however felt that in the absence of such a provision it shall be difficult to stop a person from attempting suicide for political/religious reasons. The Union of India re-enacted the Mental Health Care Act, 2017, in which Section 115 states \"... any person who attempts suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said code.\"[18] In effect, Section 309 IPC remains but prioritizes mental health needs of an individual over criminalization of the behavior. It would indeed be interesting to see how the judiciary and legislature deal with the much-debated decriminalization of Section 377. To conclude, the authors would like to clarify that this editorial in no way is trying to put forward any assertions or take any stand with respect to the issues related to the sexual orientation and LGBT phenomena. On the other hand, we have attempted to provide an insight into not only the historical perspective related to this topic in India, the psychosocial issues, and related consequences, but most importantly, the complex interplay of moral, social, and legal dilemmas operating in our society that have gathered steam over the last two decades, reaching a crescendo point in the current year. The outcome of the Supreme Court judgment should serve as a guiding beacon for all mental health professionals in the times to come. \"We wait with bated breaths…\"!",

      "abstract": "Blacks treated in Sacramento County (CA) Clinics were most likely to have gonorrhea. Chicanos were slightly more likely to have nonspecific urethritis and other sexually transmitted diseases, and Whites were most likely to be uninfected. Whites tended to name greater numbers of different sexual partners, but differences among the three groups were not statistically significant. Black men more frequently reported to clinics with genitourinary symptoms and delayed significantly longer before seeking treatment. Future research should assess the relative contributions of sexual and health behaviors to the distributions of different sexually transmitted diseases in different groups.",

La investigación tiene carácter exploratorio con una muestra no probabilística por conveniencia, conformada por seis participantes de entre 21 y 30 años, homosexuales y autoconcebidos “osos”. Se realizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas, cuyos datos fueron analizados mediante transcripciones y posterior categorización. Los hallazgos señalan una masculinidad subordinada, teñida de heteronormatividad, afirmada en la heteroidentificación y en un cuerpo fetichizado en oposición a ciertos estereotipos de delgadez. La expresión de su condición es relegada a la vida nocturna y de entretención por experiencias teñidas de discriminación y vulneración de derechos. La sexualidad del oso en Santiago de Chile presenta una elevada actividad calificada como morbosa y promiscua. Relativo a las prácticas se mencionan la sexualización completa del cuerpo en desmedro de la genitalización. Paralelamente la figura del oso es concebida como significativamente intolerante y discriminadora respecto de otro tipo de masculinidades. La relevancia de los resultados radica en entregar un marco de análisis que permita comprender la realidad de nuevas identidades homosexuales masculinas ofrenciendo a las autoridades competentes la posibilidad de visualizar nuevos actores sociales en la frontera de la sexualidad masculina.",

      "abstract": "Kemerosotan nilai- nilai moral bangsa semakin nyata terasa. Salah satu wujud\r\nnyata dari kemerosotan nilai- nilai moral tersebut adalah terjadinya inses. Inses\r\nmerupakan masalah serius dan menjadi ancaman terhadap (terutama) anak dalam\r\nsebuah relasi atau hubungan keluarga yang mengakibatkan anak menjadi korban\r\ndari pelampiasan seks keluarganya sendiri. Inses dapat terjadi dengan ataupun\r\ntanpa paksaan, kekerasan atau ancaman kekerasan. Penegakan hukum terhadap\r\ninses juga tidah mudah dilakukan mengingat inses tersebut merupakan delik\r\naduan. Besar kemungkinan terdapat lebih banyak kasus yang belum teungkap.\r\nDalam kasus inses baik pelaku ataupun korbannya akan cenderung lebih memilih\r\nuntuk menutup- nutupinya, mengingat hal tersebut menyangkut nama baik dari\r\nkeluarga. Selain itu alasan lain mengapa kasus inses ini banyak tidak tersentuh\r\nhukum adalah karena ketakutan dari korban atas ancaman- ancaman yang\r\nbiasanya diberikan oleh pelakunya untuk tidak melaporkan hal tersebut kepada\r\npihak yang berwajib. Sehingga besar kemungkinan akan terjadi trauma yang\r\nmendalam bagi korban inses, apalagi bila inses yang terjadi pada korban\r\nmenyebabkan kehamilan yang tidak diinginkan. Dengan berbagai pertimbangan,\r\nbesar kemungkinan korban akan lebih memilih untuk melakukan aborsi terhadap\r\nkehamilan yang tidak diinginkanya tersebut. Di Indonesia, aborsi pada dasarnya\r\nmerupakan suatu perbuatan yang dilarang. Namun dalam Undang- undang\r\nKesehatan, baik Undang- undang Nomor 23 Tahun 1992 tentang Kesehatan,\r\nmaupun dalam Undang- undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan\r\nterdapat perkecualian atas hal tersebut. Dalam ketentuan Undang- undang Nomor\r\n36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan, aborsi hanya dapat dilakukan terhadap\r\nkehamilan yang memiliki indikasi kedaruratan medis, atau kehamilan akibat\r\nperkosaan yang dapat menyebabkan trauma psikologis bagi korbannya. Meskipun\r\ndalam Undang- undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan tersebut tidak\r\nsecara tegas menyebutkan inses sebagai salah satu pengecualian terhadap aborsi\r\nseperti dalam Pedoman Etik Dalam Obstetri Dan Ginekologi, namun demikian\r\nInses dapat masuk pada kualifikasi perkosaan apabila hal tersebut dilakukan\r\ndengan pola disertai kekerasan ataupun ancaman kekerasan. Sehingga dengan\r\ndemikian kehamilan akibat inses yang dilakukan dengan kekerasan atau ancaman\r\nkekerasan dan mengakibatkan trauma psikologis bagi korbannya, ataupun\r\nkehamilan akibat inses yang terdapat suatu indikasi kedaruratan medis\r\nterhadapnya yang mengharuskan dilakukannya aborsi dapat dijadikan sebagai\r\nsuatu legal standing terhadap pelaksanaan aborsi tersebut.",

Studies often examine first intercourse in terms of timing, circumstances, risk reduction behavior, and consequences. Variations in these features are associated with physiological, psychological, and social factors. Individual and family characteristics, in addition to social and cultural influences such as peer culture and the media, contribute to differences in patterns of first intercourse by gender, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic class. Although the consequences of first intercourse are often discussed in terms of negative health outcomes such as pregnancy and STI rates, as well as feelings of regret, recent work has emphasized subjective experience and the possibility of enjoyment. First intercourse is socially important, as the status change from virgin to non‐virgin can represent the psychological and social transition from youth to adulthood, which individuals often have the ability to control. Broadening discussion of the consequences of first intercourse to include the positive effects on physical, emotional, and social wellbeing recognizes the event as potentially contributing to future safe and pleasurable sexual experiences.",

Rational fear is related to the deterioration of health, loneliness, loss of loved ones and the decline of social status can be intensified by negative stereotypes about the elderly. Irrational fear is related to physical changes, loss of masculinity or femininity, and the observation of mental incompetence.",

These scenes typically involve both a bearded and unbearded male figure with a nude female between them, suggesting that sex with a prostitute or flute girl could be a social activity enjoyed together by erastēs and erōmenos. These scenes should not be interpreted as satirical depictions of debauchery and excess, but as titillating conversation pieces inviting the viewers’ hermeneutics. Whether sexual pedagogy or unabashed hedonism, the common thread through all the representations we study here is the centrality of masculine spectatorship and performance to the erotic imagination of a culture familiar with athletic display of nude bodies. The females in these scenes are of little interest, mere vehicles for cementing bonds of male homosociality.",

      "title": "IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses identity development in adolescence. Adolescence is the stage of the life cycle that is most crucial in the crystallization of identity. Identity as a concept refers to a collection of traits and personal characteristics. Traits are habitual patterns of behavior, such as honesty/dishonesty, happiness/sadness, or intelligence/stupidity. Personal characteristics include physical attributes, such as height, color of hair and eyes, and condition of skin; and background factors, such as ethnic-group membership and religion. Because identity is so central to psychological functioning, it is important throughout the life cycle. Identity in adolescence is shaped by resolutions of earlier crises and will evolve further in later stages. Infancy and childhood are important because they result in identifications and identity elements that contribute to the resolution of the adolescent crisis of identity. These early stages are preludes to the central normative crisis of identity in adolescence. When an adolescent makes commitments contributing to an adult identity, particularly occupational decisions, before having a chance to experiment freely with possible roles, the sense of identity that results has no proper foundation. Such an identity results from commitment before the experience of an identity crisis has run its course.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze divorce motives and how they are linked with individual, partnership level and divorce process factors. Divorce motives are subjective accounts of the causes of divorce. Motives refer to perceptions and are different from structural causes of divorce, which often become the object of sociological inquiry. The paper is based on the analysis of the “Fathering after union dissolution” (2016) dataset, which collected information from men who experienced dissolution of the union with children. Research identified four groups of divorce motives: instrumental, expressive, behavioral and sexual or infidelity. Our main results suggest that divorce motives are associated with personality and education, partnership duration and some characteristics of divorce process. Men with lower individual resources more likely report instrumental divorce motives. Instrumental divorce motives are also positively associated with longer partnership duration. Divorce due to instrumental motives are less likely initiated by men. Expressive motives are positively associated with higher individual resources, are more pronounced in longer duration partnerships and initiated by men. Behavioral problems are more reported by men with lower individual resources, and union dissolutions most likely are initiated by women. Sexual and infidelity motives are positively associated with higher education. Overall, research on divorce motives contributes to the understanding of the structural causes of divorce. Our findings unpack meaning of relational stress, which more affects families of lower socio-economic standing.",

      "abstract": "The importance of primal-scene experience is suggested by the wide range of attention it has received, with a multitude of derivative phenomena being attributed to its influence. Emphasis has been on possible psychiatric problems, and almost all available reports are clinical and anecdotal. The classical psychoanalytic view has been that such stimulation, be it through actual witnessing or fantasy, results (especially in children) in experience of anxiety, intense eroticization, and sadomasochistic confusions about sexuality. It is suggested here that issues of affectional love and fears of aloneness and feelings of vulnerability may often be the focus of primal-scene reactions. A wide range of evidence has been presented here to support the view that primal-scene experience per se is not necessarily deleterious, and that traumatic or pathogenic effects usually occur only within a context of general brutality or disturbed family relationships. In contradistinction, some emphasis here has been placed on possible positive effects of primal-scene experience. There is a clear need for further study, especially among nonpsychiatrically selected persons, for understanding to be advanced regarding the vicissitudes of both normal and pathological primal-scene experience.",

The onset of GID commonly begins early in childhood. Gender dysphoria has a higher prevalence of other comorbid psychiatric illnesses, such as mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders, with increased suicide incidence and self-harming behaviors than the general population. Studies show that some temperamental, environmental, genetic, and psychological factors play a role in developing GID. Approximately 16% of transgender people and 21% of transgender women get incarcerated compared with the general US population. During incarceration, they face many issues, such as victimization, severe verbal harassment, purposeful humiliation, unwanted sexual advances, physical assault, forcible sex, and unwanted strip searches. There is a need for a better understanding of the issues and needs of this population to promote positive outcomes.",

Es wird ein Kulturmodell vorgestellt, in dem anzunehmender Weise die Chance auf Minimalisierung des Auftretens sexueller Funktionsstörungen bestehen kann. In dieser Kultur müßten folgende Tendenzen bestehen: 1. Abbau der Doppellmoral, 2. positive Einstellung zum vorehelichen Geschlechtsverkehr, 3. tolerante Einstellung zum sexuell abweichenden, 4. die Enttabuierung erotischer Phantasieprodukte, soweit diese in ihrer Auswirkung auf Erwachsenen beschränkt bleiben und 5. frühzeitige und genaue Sexualaufklärung.

These studies, drawn from widely different arenas, report meaningful antecedents to outcomes that include psychopathology, learning, social-role function, and gender identity. There are two reasons, however, for changing the strategy in the next stage to one of more complex causal modeling, complex in the sense of including measures of social structure, social adaptational status, psychological, and biological conditions as these evolve during the intervening period of the life cycle. Causal model's whether they involve genetic, early neurological, early endocrine, or early child-rearing characteristics require the inclusion of measures such as evolving family structure, evolving social adaptational status in fields such as school, peer group, or work, and psychological and physical status. Genetic and early biological, psychological, and social characteristics will in many if not most cases be more clearly visible in their impact on short-term outcomes early in the life-span than on long-term adolescent or adult outcomes.",

In that connection, the cases of most extreme development are probably the most important, since the greater in excess of normal is the bodily development of the child the greater might be expected to be its effect on the age at which walking begins. The instances of most advanced physical growth in the first and second years of life are undoubtedly those rare cases in which puberty is attained during this period. It has been known since the time of Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire that premature puberty is preceded and accompanied by an acceleration of skeletal development and of ossification. This is amply shown by the literature on precocious maturity. Smith, in 1822, reported the case of a boy who",

      "abstract": "Chairman Kanner: Every day of man9s life constitutes a transition between yesterday and tomorrow, converging in the intrinsic values of the moment. The past and present continue to shape and modify directions and goals, mostly through quiet evolution, sometimes in lively spurts. One of the liveliest spurts occurs during adolescence, at a time when a person is no longer a child and not yet an adult. Many incisive changes take place in that period. Body growth, in a remarkable upward surge, attains its maximum for the individual. The physique assumes its characteristic configuration. Sexual development reaches procreative capacity. There is striving after emancipation from sheltered existence, a trend toward increasing self-dependence in thought and action. The sphere of interest and participation expands from the confines of home, neighborhood and school to the community at large. The choice of vocation, until then a playfully considered matter, becomes a real issue. Current standards and precepts are submitted to criticism not as yet leavened by the tests of experience. The established order is challenged boldly and then, after some struggle, appropriated gradually with more or less reservation. Adolescence, in our culture, is a great translator. It translates the language of parental direction, attitudes and behavior into an individualized idiom. This is much less evident in primitive cultures. One might go so far as to say that in primitive societies there is no conceptual equivalent for that which we call adolescence. Childhood ceases abruptly when, through a set of elaborate rites, it is transported into full-fledged adulthood. Tribal ritualism, rather than personal spontaneity determines status and function. In our social structure, a child is given several years in which he is to find his way from a more or less manipulated and regimented existence to the acquisition of initiative in a loosely competitive environment in which the taboos are blurred, the semantics are equivocal, and the variety of occupational, political and theologic choices offers opportunities for perplexities. The adolescent translator9s dictionary is full of confusing synonyms and antonyms. A combination of inner soundness, wholesome parent-child relationship, and guidance from understanding adults, helps most adolescents to emerge safely from the groping and floundering which precede maturing stabilization.",

      "abstract": "When the life cycle of the human female is viewed from the perspective of parenthood, its major features clearly support a uniquely human pattern of high levels of long-term parental investment and the dependency of multiple young of differing ages. In developed countries menarche occurs at 12 to 13, cultural infertility breaks down in the late teens, and intercourse before marriage requires the use of contraception or abortion. Lactation is so short that birth spacing is dependent on contraception. A cross-species perspective suggests that adolescence in the human species has its own unique set of characteristics—some of which are shared with closest living relatives, the great apes, and others which may be found only in humans. For girls, the first external sign of puberty is the development of the breast bud. This is an odd and noteworthy feature of human development and one that is likely to go unnoticed without comparative mammalian data.",

We explored how long sexual satisfaction would remain elevated following sex and predicted that stronger sexual afterglow would characterize more satisfying partnerships. We pooled the data from two independent, longitudinal studies of newlywed couples to examine these issues. Spouses reported their daily sexual activity and sexual satisfaction for 14 days and their marital satisfaction at baseline and 4 or 6 months later. Results demonstrated that sexual satisfaction remained elevated approximately 48 hr after sex, and spouses experiencing a stronger afterglow reported higher levels of marital satisfaction both at baseline and over time. We interpret these findings as evidence that sexual afterglow is a proximal cognitive mechanism through which sex promotes pair bonding.",

In this paper, the researcher used a variety of longitudinal studies to examine the relationship between the maturation of a person's sense of self and their sexuality from childhood through young adulthood. Those who scored higher on the extraversion scale were also more likely to engage in traditional sexual behaviors, for instance, going out on dates. However, less conventional sexual behaviors were associated with less pleasant, less conscientious, and more neurotic personalities. In addition, the researcher uncovered evidence of correlative effects, with sexual experiences being associated with increases in extraversion and neuroticism and decreases in agreeableness. There was a genetic link between sexually typical behaviors and extroversion and a genetic link between sexually specific behaviors and affective personality traits. Common environmental influences predominantly accounted for correlations between sexually non-normative behaviors and personality and sexual behaviors and attributes linked to behavioral control. These findings draw attention to two personality processes that contribute to and shape adolescent sexual development: those governed by emotion regulation through genetics and those governed by shared environmental influences on behavioral regulation mechanisms.",

Participants provided global, retrospective descriptions of their emotional characteristics at an initial session, and then provided momentary emotion ratings as well as details about the social context in which they experienced their emotions over a one-week period. We predicted and found that sex-related differences in emotion in global self-descriptions, but not in the averaged momentary ratings of emotion. Furthermore, only sex of the interaction partner elicited sex differences in emotionality; participants experienced and expressed more emotion when in opposite-sex dyads. Although most of the other context variables were themselves associated with emotional experience or expression, suggesting that they were emotionally evocative, none emerged as elicitors of sex differences in emotional experience; felt intimacy in the interaction was associated with sex differences in ratings of emotional expression. Together, the findings present certain caveats to the widely held belief that women are the ''more emotional'' sex.",

      "abstract": "Late modernity’s binary intrigue of child sexuality/abuse is understood as a backlash phenomenon reactive to a general trans‐Atlantic crisis concerning the interlocking of kinship, religion, gender, and sexuality. Tellingly dissociated from 1980s gay liberation and recent encounters between queer theory and kinship studies, the child abuse theme articulates modernity’s guarded axiom of tabooed incest and its projected contemporary predicament “after the orgy”—after the proclaimed disarticulation of religion‐motivated, kin‐pivoted, reproductivist, and gender‐rigid socialities. “Child sexual abuse” illustrates a general situation of decompensated nostalgia: an increasingly imminent loss of the child’s vital otherness is counterproductively embattled by the late modern overproduction of its banal difference, its status as “minor.” Attempts to humanize, reform, or otherwise moderate incest’s current “survivalist” and commemorative regime of subjectivation, whether by means of ethical, empirical, historical, critical, legal, or therapeutic gestures, typically trigger the latter’s panicked empiricism. Accordingly, most “critical” interventions, from feminist sociology and anthropology to critical legal studies, have largely been collusive with the backlash: rather than appraising the radical precariousness of incest’s ethogram of avoidance in the face of late modernity’s dispossessing analytics and semiotics, they tend to feed its state of ontological vertigo and consequently hyperextended, manneristic forensics.",

While gender socialisation itself is a cross-cultural phenomenon, there are differences in the way that the process manifests itself cross-culturally. This is, in part, due to differences in the perceived roles of males and females across societies. Once the sex of a child is known, be that before or after birth, the process of gender socialisation begins. Parents generally prefer that their children adhere to traditional gender-roles, and are concerned when they do not. Rigid adherence to stereotypical gender roles can have negative consequences in childhood and beyond, as these stereotypes can limit children's educational and occupational aspirations, perceived academic competency, emotional expression, and social development.

      "abstract": "Abstract Childlessness in late male adulthood is increasingly prevalent in rural China, indicating a need to understand the factors contributing to it. This group is often overlooked in gerontological and childlessness research. While existing studies have explored individual-level predictors of childlessness over the lifecourse and implications of broader societal conditions at the population level, little is known about how lifecourse and structural factors interact to shape pathways to childlessness. This study aims to investigate structural factors contributing to childlessness among older men in a rural area of northern China. It focuses on the life stories of 13 childless older men and the effects of history, timing and life-domain interdependencies, finding that some participants experienced intense disruptive life events or critical turning points – early-life care-giving responsibilities, disability or withdrawal from school – that altered their life trajectories. These events often intersected with structural factors, including unstable and low-paid employment, lack of social protection and prevailing social norms, which reinforced one another and jointly constrained prospects for marriage and parenthood. These trajectories unfolded within shifting policy contexts; institutional arrangements across different historical periods shaped and often produced disadvantages in the marriage market. This study advances theoretical understanding of the structural factors contributing to male childlessness by recognizing life trajectories, structural shifts and social relations as linked factors shaping cumulative disadvantage in union formation and childbearing. Its policy implications surround supporting individuals who intend to form families during critical life transitions and addressing the broader structural barriers that shape male childlessness in rural areas.",

      "title": "Do attachment styles influence the sexual function of an individual?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Attachment theory, first proposed by John Bowlby and later extended by Mary Ainsworth and others, outlines how experiences of early childhood attachment with caregivers can affect one’s emotional and interpersonal relationships throughout adulthood. Typically, attachment styles are categorised into four main types: secure, anxious-ambivalent, avoidant and disorganised. Conversely, it is recognised that various biological, psychological, relational, social and iatrogenic factors elements can impact an individual’s sexual function. Objectives Our aim with this research was to present the most current literature on whether there is a correlation between attachment styles and sexual function. Methods We conducted a non-systematic review on the topic using PubMed and PsycInfo. Results There is evidence indicating a link between attachment styles and sexual function. People with secure attachment styles tend to experience more positive and fulfilling sexual relationships. Such individuals typically have a more positive self-image, they feel at ease with emotional intimacy, and are therefore able to openly communicate their needs and desires. They exhibit a healthy balance between seeking closeness and maintaining independence. Individuals with anxious attachment styles may experience heightened levels of sexual anxiety and insecurity. Concerns regarding rejection or abandonment within sexual relationships may impact their sexual function and satisfaction. These individuals usually have a negative self-image and may be more prone to seek reassurance and validation through sexual activities. People with avoidant attachment styles may encounter obstacles in developing emotional intimacy and closeness, which can negatively affect their sexual relationships. Such individuals might experience commitment anxiety and prioritise physical aspects of sexual activity over emotional bonding, ultimately decreasing sexual satisfaction for both them and their partners. Disorganised attachment styles are linked with challenges in regulating their emotions and behaviours in intimate situations, which can have a negative impact on sexual function and satisfaction. Conclusions While the literature proposes attachment styles may impact sexual function, it is important to acknowledge other factors that contribute to sexual function. In addition to biological and iatrogenic factors, individual personality, relationship dynamics, past experiences, and cultural influences all have a significant role in shaping one’s sexual behaviour and satisfaction. All of these should be addressed in order to alleviate sexual difficulties. Moreover, attachment styles may develop and change over time through positive relationships and therapeutic interventions, potentially leading to changes in one’s sexual functioning and relationship dynamics.
