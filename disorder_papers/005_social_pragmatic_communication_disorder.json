      "abstract": "The essential features of Asperger’s Disorder are severe and sustained impairment in social interaction and development of restricted repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. This disturbance must cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas o functioning. In contrast to Autistic Disorder, there are no clinically significant delays or deviance in language acquisition (e.g., single non-echoed words are communicatively by age 2 years, and spontaneous communicative phrases are used by age 3 years), although more subtle aspects of social communication (e.g., typical give-and-take in conversation may be affected.” (p. 80).",

      "title": "Development of Communicative Competence through Private and Inner Speech",
      "abstract": "One of the most challenging psycholinguistic problems children face when they are acquiring a first language is learning how to use it to communicate. Communicating with speech is complex because it is simultaneously a social, linguistic, and psychological activity. Although most research on children's acquisition of language has focused on the lexical, semantic, and syntactic structures, it is the discourse structures of language that are pivotal to communication (Moffett, 1968). Discourse occupies the level of organization of language just above the sentence or clause – the sociolinguistic level where a sentence initiated by one person is met with a responding sentence from another person (Stubbs, 1983). The initiation-response structure of discourse frames and regulates the interpersonal exchange of sentences, as well as the ideas conveyed by them. Conversational activity – the most basic type of discourse – has the capacity to structure communicative interactions because it is conducted according to social conventions, the most obvious of which is the alternation of turns at talking and listening.",

      "abstract": "Social/interpersonal context plays an important role in shaping the meaning of an utterance. Social context is, strictly speaking, extralinguistic (Lakoff, 1972: 911). Lakoff argues that “one must be able to refer to assumptions about the social context of an utterance, as well as to other implicit assumptions made by the participants in a discourse” (907). Regarding the complexity and changeable characteristic of social context, one should never take for granted that one rule of communication can apply in all situations. A communication under a special condition requires different rule application; something that is polite in normal context may become rude in a special context. Failure to observe the social context leads to a communication failure such as misinterpretation and offense. Therefore, one must excercise his/her sensitivenes even to the slightest change in the social context in order to make the communication succesful.",

      "title": "Expressive Merchandise and the First Amendment in Public Fora",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION People create expressive materials all the time, in endless variety. These materials may express political or ideological affiliation, aspirations, attempts at persuasion, social or cultural commentary, religious devotion or righteousness, or even private assertions of identity, passion, and dread. Expression, commonly defined as act, process, or instance of representing in a medium, (1) is broad enough to include both a boisterous parade of thousands (2) and an individual's secret diary. (3) Some expressions are and always remain private, but those that enter the public sphere may come into contact with--and conflict with--the expressions of others, and the rules and regulations of social intercourse. (4) The desire to make public expressions is not limited to individuals or groups with a persuasive or proselytizing purpose; expressions may be aired in public simply as an assertion of self or to create awareness or confrontation. (5) Public expressions can take many forms, such as parading, rallying, distributing leaflets, (6) hanging posters, (7) giving soapbox speeches, (8) public musical performance, (9) and selling ex materials, (10) some of which have found protection under the free clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. (11) Cities, municipalities, and other kinds of local governments have the responsibility for allocating and maintaining public space so that it can be used by the citizenry that pays for it, without trampling the individual rights of the citizens who want to make such use. (12) Since two parades may not occur at the same time in the same place, cities must necessarily regulate the use of public space in such a way that at times inconveniences, delays, or mutes some public expression. (13) From this fact of civic responsibility, a judicial doctrine has developed to permit regulations on the time, place, and manner of public speech protected by the First Amendment. (14) The test, which will be discussed in greater detail below, generally permits cities to create reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of public expression, so long as the restrictions do not touch the content of the expression, and are reasonable. (15) What is reasonable depends in part on the forum at issue; (16) this Comment will focus on contentions over what are known as public such as streets and sidewalks. (17) Time, place, and manner restrictions on the use of traditional public fora are subject to intermediate scrutiny (18) by the courts, which requires a determination as to whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to promote a city's legitimate interests, and whether there are adequate alternatives for people affected by the regulation to conduct their expressive activity. (19) Cities have an interest in limiting the number of people expressing themselves in public areas because unrestrained expressive activity could lead to uncontrollable conflict between individuals or groups over space, volume, aesthetics, equal access, viewpoint, and other points of contention. (20) Thus, there is conflict between those who want access to public spaces in which to conduct expressive activities, like sidewalks, and the cities in charge of maintaining those sidewalks that wish to exercise control and restraint on that expressive activity--not necessarily because of the substance of the expression, but merely because the expression exists. Courts have struggled to strike a balance between the interests of individuals and cities with the application of intermediate scrutiny to content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions, and several variations have emerged. (21) This Comment will examine the breadth of those approaches as they affect the determination of what expression triggers First Amendment protection. This issue is timely in light of a recent decision handed down from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Mastrovincenzo v. …",

      "title": "FEATURES OF THE FORMATION OF SOCIAL ACTIVITY OF YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES",
      "abstract": "Introduction. The integration of youth with disabilities, as well as their inclusion in a full and active life, is an important stage in the development of modern Ukrainian society. Accordingly, the values of inclusion, its principles and ideas provide that no person should be separated from society, and the status of a disabled person cannot deprive one of the opportunity to be a full member of society. Despite the positive experience of solving important youth issues, in Ukraine there are also challenges for young people with disabilities, related to the need for self-realization and development of their potential, which affects the ability to be an independent, sustainable, active member of the community. The relevance of the issue of inclusion of young people with disabilities in life in society is related both to the psychological characteristics of the individual (shyness, isolation, avoidance of failure, inability to adapt to new circumstances, imperfection of social and communication skills, etc.), and to their lack of active life position and the development of dependent tendencies (insufficient formation of prosocial motives for behavior, reluctance to change one’s own life or fear of change). The reduced activity of young people with disabilities, in a certain way, is related to barriers that prevent people of this category from receiving such services as health care, education, professional employment, active leisure, mobility, as well as access to information resources, etc. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to reveal the peculiarities of the formation of social activity of young people with special educational needs in the process of obtaining an education and in extracurricular activities. Achieving the set goal was facilitated by solving the following tasks: – disclosure of the concept of «social activity»; – consideration of the factors of formation of social activity of student youth of different levels; – determination of specific features of the formation of social activity of youth with disabilities. Results. The factors of the formation of social activity of student youth at the macro level (levels of society), meso level (levels of the educational environment) and micro level (personal level) are analyzed. Modern priority vectors of theoretical and practical experience of scientists regarding the issue of formation of social activity in the process of socialization of the individual under the direct influence of a complex of external and internal factors are outlined. The specifics of the activity and activity of students with disabilities in the process of studying at a higher education institution and in extracurricular activities have been clarified. Ways of formation and development of social activity of young people with health disorders are proposed.",

En el español peninsular, usted es el pronombre que suele emplearse para expresar formalidad y distancia, mientras que en otras variedades, como el español colombiano (Uber 1985), el mismo pronombre puede ser utilizado para expresar tanto intimidad como distancia.",

But these limits are always broken. Youth are, in this respect, in a difficult situation, especially those from marginalized areas. Victims of contempt and exclusion, they react through violent acts; to violence experienced because of excessive constraints in school, they respond with violence. This juvenile violence calls for macro-social responses that return credibility to the institutional system often corrupt and responsible for hidden social violence. It also calls for micro-social actions, especially within the community. These actions may allow for awareness of violence generating phenomena, the discovery of obstacles to exercising rights, and the make-up of conflicts and their resolution in negotiation procedures.",

      "abstract": "1Comunicazione: un termine quasi diventato di moda, oggi, tanto pare essere al centro di nuovi processi tecnologici, istanze economiche, politiche e sociali in genere. Tecniche - cosiddette - di comunicazione, arti piu o meno esteticamente plausibili, per in pubblico, con gli altri, manipolare, sedurre, influenzare etc. diventano a prima vista disponibili, provenienti da piu aree disciplinari ed applicate a diversi settori organizzativi e istituzionali. Ma forse occorre riflettere su che cosa intendiamo parlando di comunicazione; in particolare quando vogliamo comunicare su temi di densa rilevanza sociale come appunto e la salute. Bastano le etichette di efficacia, trasparenza, chiarezza, o criteri estetici e strumentali per valutarla e organizzarla? Se la posta in gioco consiste nel realizzare una vera e propria comunicazione sociale, forse puo valere talvolta la pena fermarsi ad analizzare invece che scegliere l'urgenza dell'immediato limitandosi ad un discorso tecnico, magari piu consolidato nei settori privati del marketing, ad esempio, ma spesso meno complessivamente efficace su tematiche che toccano l'esperienza e il comportamento quotidiano delle persone. Vorremmo percio mostrare che alcuni assioni convenzionali sulla comunicazione spesso rischiano di risultare riduttivi se teniamo conto di quanto complicato sia il processo pratico di elaborazione degli effetti delle informazioni sul comportamento quotidiano. Cercheremo in particolare di sottolineare l'importanza di quello che possiamo chiamare ambiente sociale della comunicazione. La dove, invece, molti principi ispirati a competenze comunicative di tipo quasi-tecnico sono legati ad una prospettiva di analisi della comunicazione fondata in gran parte sull'informazione. Diverse teorie considerano le nostre azioni come razionali e i nostri errori (ad es. gli equivoci o le incomprensioni) derivanti da contingenti disturbi emotivi, carenze di risorse personali e cognitive, o pregiudizi quasi ascrittivi.

      "abstract": "Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for the past, is an ambivalent – albeit more positive than negative – emotion. Nostalgia is infused with sociality, as it refers to important figures from one's past or to momentous life events that include those figures. Dispositional nostalgia is related to prejudice reduction via increases in a form of sociality, empathy. Experimentally induced nostalgia fosters sociality, operationalised as social connectedness (sense of acceptance). Social connectedness, in turn, has downstream consequences for (1) inspiration and goal-pursuit, (2) self-continuity and wellbeing, as well as (3) inclusion of an outgroup member in the self or outgroup trust and intergroup contact intentions. At the collective level, nostalgia confers sociality benefits to the ingroup (favourable attitudes, support, loyalty, collective action, barrier to collective guilt), but is also associated with negative sides of sociality such as outgroup rejection and exclusion. Collective nostalgia's sociality is amenable to exploitation and can have controversial ramifications.",

      "abstract": "...We expect our students to upgrade their knowledge and skills over their careers, yet do not help them acquire effective self-directed learning skills. There is little integration of knowledge in social work education or coordination of teaching. The curriculum is broken into individual parts - policy, methods, research – with few efforts to integrate them. There is a lack of integration between class and field. There has long been an ‘add-on’ approach in social work education, in which we simply add new content, resulting in an unintegrated and (often) indigestible mix. This fragmentation gets in the way of learning (e.g. seeing the interrelationships among different areas). Obscurantism abounds... Key aims espoused often remain undefined... ...because there are different views about what social justice is, pursuing vague, related outcomes inevitably involves imposing some people’s view of social justice on others.\r\n(Gambrill, 1997, p. 320)\r\nSocial Workers are employed in non-profit organizations, government offices, and in private practice.

      "title": "Social-political influences on research practices: examining language acquisition by African American children",
      "abstract": "Spoken language is a complex human process involving biological, mental, and social sub-systems. It ought not be surprising that language is acquired over time, its social-pragmatic aspects extending across the human life span. Age-dependent patterns of typical language use are important to the professional practices of applied fields such as communication disorders and education. They guide the diagnosis and treatment of communication disorders. They also guide the pedagogical practices, e.g. curricular planning and evaluation of student readiness to participate in school programs. Aside from professional practices, implicit norms of behavior, inclusive of spoken communication, guide the rules of social engagement and participation in the cultural institutions of religion, work, play, and the rituals of daily living. Even the staunchest defenders of nativist views of language acquisition concede that social factors influence language learning. Compromised language development in feral children (Curtiss 1977) is prima facie evidence that human social interaction is critical. However, what has been debatable is whether all social groups learn a language and/or engage in socialization practices that enable their adequate development. A case in point is the native-born group of African Americans in the United States (US), who are the focus of this chapter. It is the second largest racial minority group in this country (2000 Census). Many of its thirty million African American citizens acquire a non-prestige dialect of English as their first language, which is referred to here as African American Vernacular English (AAVE).",

Also, longer‐term and macro‐structural changes usually require greater attention to self‐sustainability of communication activities, engaging whole communities and organizations (not just individuals) and creating mechanisms for ongoing participation by and coordination among stakeholder groups at multiple levels of social organization from the international and national level to the local and community level (→ Participatory Communication).",

      "abstract": "What is it? An action-oriented approach views “users and learners of a language primarily as ‘social agents’, i.e. members of society who have tasks (not exclusively language-related) to accomplish in a given set of circumstances, in a specific environment and within a particular field of action. While acts of speech occur within language activities, these activities form part of a wider social context, which alone is able to give them their full meaning” (Council of Europe, 2001, p. 9). As ‘social agents’, learners fully engage in meaningful real-life situations to which they learn to respond in a wholly cognitive and emotional manner, mobilizing their unique linguistic and sociocultural repertoires. Here, the notion of ‘task’ goes beyond the mere notion of a communicative activity to encompass the realization of projects or problems to be solved rooted in reality, socially, and culturally situated, through a set of targeted and concerted ‘social’ actions, ‘not exclusively language-related’, to achieve a clearly defined objective. Whether within the community in a community-based approach, or in the classroom, itself perceived as a mini-society with a social dimension (Puren, 2009), learners engage and collaborate with peers and others as they mobilize and acquire prior and new skills, knowledge, values, and know-how to solve real-life problems.

Given the complexity of social interactions, social competence is the product of a wide range of cognitive abilities, emotional processes, behavioral skills, social awareness, and personal and cultural values related to interpersonal relationships. To further complicate the understanding of this concept, social competence is dependent on developmental characteristics (i.e., expectations of social competence vary by age of person), the specific social situation (i.e., people may be socially competent in one situation but not in another, or a child may appear more competent when interacting with a socially skilled partner than with a shy person), and cultural characteristics (i.e., specific acts of social competence are bound by cultural expectations). In an effort to integrate these components, Orpinas and Horne (2006) defined social competence as “a person's age‐appropriate knowledge and skills for functioning peacefully and creatively in his or her own community or social environment” (p. 108).",

      "title": "THE COMMUNICATION STYLES IN THE DOMAIN OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS OR TO BE OR NOT TO BE ETHICAL",
      "abstract": "The way of communication is one of the most important elements in an effective dialog in any democratic society. It includes a number of considerations and requirements. “Dialogue requires being taken out of the field of interest (...)“. Usually, the pleasure of dialogue does not consist of reaching consensus, but of the constant and persistent enrichment” (Menyono &amp; Dinimic 2000:15). Numerous studies explicitly state that the trust in a person involved in communication is often more important than the contents of what has been said. Insincere communication is associated with the manifestation of complex behavioral patterns in the process of interpersonal interaction, with the goal of prevailing in the communication process. The persuasion principle is one of the major tools in establishing the way of communication in the sphere of public affairs. But, the key to democratic and sincere communication is the ethical approach to a dialog in the first place. In the mosaic of communication, in the domain of public affairs, we will focus on the persuasive style of communication, ethical and non-ethical behavior of parties in the process of communicating, adopting the interdisciplinary character of analysis. “Embracing this kind of guideline deters us from imposing our ways and our values on others, whose experience and views of appropriate communication may differ from our own” (Wood, 2006: 40).",

      "abstract": "Health promotion communication interventions invariably raise ethical issues because they aim to influence people’s views and lifestyles, and they are often initiated, funded, and influenced by government agencies or powerful public or private organizations. With the increasing use of commercial advertising tactics in health promotion communication interventions, ethical issues regarding advertising can be raised in health promotion communication when it applies techniques such as highly emotional appeals, exaggerations, omissions, provocative tactics, or the use of children. Key ethical concerns relate to infringing on people’s privacy, interfering with their right to freedom of choice and autonomy, and issues of equity (such as by widening social gaps, where mainly those who are better off benefit from the interventions). Interventions using digital media raise ethical issues regarding the digital divide and privacy. The interventions may have unintended adverse effects on the psychological well-being of individuals or groups (e.g., by inadvertently stigmatizing or labeling people portrayed as negative models). They can also have an effect on cultural aspects of society (e.g., by idealizing particular lifestyles or turning health into a value) and raise concerns regarding democratic processes and citizens’ consent to the interventions. Interventions can have repercussions in multicultural settings since members of diverse populations may hold beliefs or engage in practices considered by health promoters as “unhealthy,” but which have important cultural significance. There are also ethical concerns regarding collaborations between health promoters and for-profit organizations. Identifying and considering ethical issues in the intervention is important for both moral and practical reasons. Several ethical conceptual frameworks are briefly presented that elucidate central ethical principles or concerns, followed by ethical issues associated with specific contexts or aspects of communication interventions.",

During the last few decades, several studies have shown that social workers have unfair working conditions which have led to both ill-health and increased turnover. A central aim of the article is to shed light on the break-up narratives of 31 social workers who have left their workplaces due to discontent with the organization. In terms of theory, the study draws upon a discursive narrative approach – how language is used to accomplish social actions. e aim of study is to analyse how the social workers narrate their working conditions, what they convey and how they construct a professional identity. Findings show that the social workers: (1) by rhetorical resources such as details, extreme case formulations, metaphorical expressions etc. illustrate an unsustainable work- ing situation; (2) convey criticism and testify to a lack of trust/reliance in their relation to organi- zational agents when the agents ignore calls for improvements, their communication is decient and dominated by blame and a call for loyalty; and (3) construct their identity by establishing a we-ness when talking about professional ethics and a collegial solidarity.",

      "title": "AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMMUNICATION: AN INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION APPROACH",
      "abstract": "In general, an effective communication is something so difficult to do. The communication process always involves cross cultural factors which would form a potential communication problems. These factors are, such as semantic problems, is that the same of words but having different meaning by the communicators that come from different cultures. Also, the problems are related with tone and intonation voices, perception, etc that come from different clusters of social and cultures.In the organization, the differences that come from different clusters of cultural society are also potential to become barriers of the effective communication which results in incorrect interpretation, evaluation and perception. More over if the boss suffered by “a hard to hearing disease”, as results of differences of position and class that owned by the boss, the barriers would be grow bigger and bigger. The other problems could be come from the Indonesian ethnic groups who embrace “high-context culture”, so that the information such as advice, complain, critic, etc., do not need to be submitted in words, verbal forms. In the high-context culture’s groups, information obtained by conclusion, behavior, and even in silences. More over if the process is related to the superior-subordinate position, so that the process of communication becomes an ineffective one. The boss is often seeing that the messages come from the subordinates is negative, not qualified, so it does not to be heard. If it happens it could cause anxiety and reluctance of subordinates to deliver the right information. Adverse impact of the organization is the existence of subordinate’s dissatisfaction and distrust of the superiors, and therefore contributes the overall organizational performance.This description reveals the barriers that exist in a cross cultural communication in order to achieve an effective organizational communication. The approach used is descriptive qualitative, which produces description of the behavior of certain individuals in an organization and analyzed from the point of view of a thorough and complete. The data obtained from several sources who have worked in an organization for a long time. The author uses the theory of triangulation of sources, methodological, and theories to obtain reliable data. The description of the findings in this paper is the need for cross-cultural approach to organizational communication to achieve an effective communication.",

      "abstract": "Socialization is the process whereby novices gain knowledge and skills relevant to membership in a social group.This process is realized largely through language practices and social interactions that engage novices in a variety of communicative and situational roles.The study of socialization is to a large extent the study of how the social and linguistic organization of such language practices and social interactions bear on the emergence of social and cultural competence.A species-wide characteristic of human beings is that they may experience socialization across the lifespan.Indeed, societal change may be related to the possibility of lifelong socialization, as each instance of socialization is an opportunity space not only for continuity of tradition but also for transformation in the expected social order and in what counts as knowledge and competence.Because participation in societies demands diverse and complex arenas of competence, members may find themselves relative novices in some arenas even though they are relative experts in others.Members may be more knowledgeable on one topic than another (e.g., politics versus religion, reggae versus jazz), more skillful in one role than another (e.g., administrator versus teacher, experimental physicist versus theoretical physicist), more experienced in one activity than another (e.g., speechmaking versus essay writing, litigating a court case versus persuading a child to eat dinner).Of course, being more or less knowledgeable, skillful, and experienced does not necessarily mean that parties to an encounter will necessarily display a stance of expert or novice.In some cases.",

Estos conflictos pueden ser positivos si generan soluciones creativas compatibles con las necesidades y los niveles de satisfaccion de los implicados.

Pocos autores se han centrado en el estres que resulta de la interaccion social negativa en el trabajo. Ello tal vez sea debido a la creencia antigua, apoyada por algunos investigadores de que las interacciones sociales estan influenciadas por factores situacionales y aleatorios que son, por tanto, menos relevantes para el rediseno del trabajo y de la organizacion.\n\nLos conflictos interpersonales en los entornos del trabajo, al igual que en otras areas de la vida, pueden adoptar formas muy variadas y grados de intensidad tambien muy variables, pudiendo ir desde pequenos desencuentros hasta situaciones de hostilidad abierta e incluso llegar a la manifestacion de conductas claramente agresivas (desde el punto de vista fisico y desde el psicologico), habitualmente tipificadas en nuestro ordenamiento juridico. Tales situaciones de conflicto acaban teniendo un fuerte impacto en los aspectos psicologicos, emocionales, fisicos y laborales de la victima, consecuencias que en muchos casos terminan traduciendose en costes para la empresa (productividad, funcionamiento, costes de produccion, desmotivacion, bajas,...), para el individuos (enfermedad, drogodependencias, perdida del puesto de trabajo, paro...) y para la sociedad (seguro de desempleo, pension de invalidez, asistencia medica por enfermedad...).",

      "title": "Social ordering or social action in early-modern England",
      "abstract": "fundamental way in which people interact socially is how they address each other (or, when not in face-to-face situations, refer to each other). In their interaction – circumscribed and influenced by emotional responses and (the avoidance of) embarrassment – social actors employ a variety of forms of address: names, nicknames, social titles, which impute familiarity and closeness; distance and respect; courtesy; or dismissiveness. Many of those responses are dispersed through the deposition in the archdeaconry court of Oxford above. Reported social address can thus furnish an insight into the praxis of social relationships with an elemental poignancy. Quotidian social interaction through the ‘speech community’s’ language use in addressing individuals, when considered in its totality, moreover, can take us further than the relationships between individuals. The accumulation of this social interaction can reveal something about the ordering of local society. Two perceptions of early-modern social ordering – through ‘national’ and local lenses – though not necessarily antithetical, have been suggested, the one established on a social language of ‘sorts’ and the other of ‘chief inhabitants’, ‘core’ or ‘focal’ families. The language of address and naming informs that consideration of the ordering of society, but perhaps avoids two principal issues. First, although all language use consists of rhetoric, the self-acclamation of ‘chief inhabitants’ persuasively projected a self-representation of a particular group. Secondly, those social categories hitherto formulated were problematically and resolutely male-centred. Now, although local society’s use of names and forms of address was no less imbued with rhetorical overtones, it allows some penetration into the world of quotidian exchange and how female actors were incorporated into local social ordering – all at an elemental, fundamental social level.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive skills tend to grow and change in interdependent ways across development, yet it remains unclear whether (a) early patterns of cognitive coupling depend on social-skill development and (b) whether individual differences in such coupling have predictive value for later behavioral outcomes. We addressed these questions using eight repeated assessments from the NICHD–SECCYD longitudinal study, tracking children from early childhood through adolescence. Using continuous-time structural equation models, we modelled dynamic, reciprocal interactions among cognitive (e.g., vocabulary, attention, memory, executive functioning) and social (e.g., assertion, cooperation, responsibility, self-control, peer competence) domains from age 4.5 to 15 years. Cognitive traits showed stronger overall growth and rank-order stability than social traits, whereas social-emotional skills displayed tighter internal coupling. Executive functioning emerged as a central connector across domains, showing robust cross-domain associations with multiple social skills. Children who exhibited more behavioral problems at age 15 had weaker early cross-domain trait correlations—particularly between (rather than within) cognitive and social domains—indicating lower early developmental integration. By adolescence, these children showed increased cohesion within the cognitive domain but reduced coupling with social traits, suggesting a shift toward domain-specific rather than integrated development. These findings highlight how early differences in the co-development of cognitive and social abilities may shape later behavioral adjustment, supporting a dynamic, systems-level view of developmental risk and adaptation.",

It is driven by such issues as incompatibilities between the parties; perceived differences in needs, beliefs, and values; and limited resources (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1995, 1996, 2009). Schools as institutions and as communities are therefore not without conflict when students, staff, and parents interact in and around the school. Nor are schools without aggression. Intricately interwoven with conflict, aggression becomes evident early in life; involves a deliberate intent to harm; often uses force or domination over others; and evolves from physical through verbal to indirect forms as children develop their social skills, language capabilities, and social intelligence (Tremblay, Gervais, &amp; Petitclerc, 2008).",

      "title": "Evolutionary Approaches to Understanding Children's Academic Achievement",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are evolved cognitive biases that influence what people pay attention to (e.g., faces, not rocks) and how they interpret this information (e.g., underlying intentions). These cognitive biases are organized to help us understand ourselves and other people (folk psychology), other species (folk biology), and the physical world (folk physics). Human cultural advances have resulted in the development of evolutionarily novel concepts (e.g., natural selection) and skills (e.g., reading) that are built from this evolved core. The basic architecture of folk cognitive biases is universal and adapted to nuances in local conditions as children play, interact with other people, and explore the environment. The learning of evolutionarily novel competencies is necessary for success in today's economy but children do not learn these as easily as they adapt folk knowledge nor are they as motivated to engage in the associated activities. This is because learning academic competencies requires adapting folk systems for tasks for which they did not evolve. The associated activities (e.g., direct instruction) are very different from the activities (e.g., play) that foster the adaptation of folk abilities to local conditions. Schooling thus involves the society‐wide organization of children's activities so they learn competencies that would not otherwise emerge. This perspective allows us to better understand the importance of working memory, a motivational focus on effort, and the need for explicit, organized instruction for children's learning in school.",

Narrative accounts revealed six reasons for failing to voice disagreement with the social exclusion of others: (a) group dynamics, (b) social fears, (c) uncertainty, (d) social inadequacies,(e) qualities of the excluded individual, and (f) low motivation. Seventy percent of these adolescents shared specific language they now regretted not using at the time. Two cognitive frameworks emerged: (a) group membership was perceived as fragile and (b) rejection stigma was perceived as contagious. A model describing negative social reasoning used by those who remain silent during the rejection of others is offered, as well as intervention strategies to stimulate prosocial group inclusion.",

For heuristic purposes, I propose a tentative distinction between: (1) social interactional rules as those governing social behavior within social structural contexts having such features as, for example, role, hierarchy, exchange requirements, etc.; and (2) sociolinguistic rules governing the use of resources of spoken and written language within sets of social structural constraints. I propose a further distinction between system-specific rules and rules which may be common to all societies (or sociolinguistic systems) and provide illustrations for each type of rule at each level of possible generality. All students of human social behavior (and probably most, if not all students of other animal social behavior) see that behavior as persistent, pattemed, non-random, rule-govemed. (Even so-called free variation is probably non-random-the rules which govern it are simply not very interesting.)' This fact lies at the roots of scholarly work in a number of disciplines in the natural and social sciences and in the humanities, whose practitioners involve themselves in research directed to the specification of the rules themselves; to a search for their sources; to understanding their acquisition by members of social groups; to a comprehension of the relations of rules across levels (viz., physiological psychological, social); to answers to questions about their stability and change.

(3) Do these patterns extend to pathological declines associated with dementia? Individuals with a diversity of social partners retain general cognitive functioning more so than individuals with a limited set of social partners. Social integration provides stimulation and activities, and mitigates negative emotion in ways that contribute to cognitive health. Findings suggest that social ties cannot deter pathological declines associated with dementia. In sum, a wide range of social partners appears to be one of multiple resources (e.g., higher socioeconomic status, better locus of control, better health behaviors) that help maintain cognitive functioning in late life.",

      "title": "Overcoming “The Language Rubicon\": Versions, Steps and Evolutionary Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "The most plausible hypotheses explaining the breakthrough of our distant ancestors to articulate speech and consciousness include: rituals of solidarity (singing, grooming, facial expressions, gestures), the role of \"labor\", teaching children, changes in gender relations, recruiting (mobilization for collective action), laryngeal transformation, brain growth, mirror neurons, neuronal overlap; dominance of coalitions over loners, self-domestication, the need to coordinate decisions; joint intentionality, development of normativity. The concretization of the principle of \"cultural drive\" leads to the following concept: new environmental, social and communicative challenges and concerns lead to multiple trials; successful behavior is consolidated in group practices, mental structures of participants, and hereditary inclinations with multilevel selection and change of many generations. Overcoming the \"language Rubicon\" took place in several steps, or stages, in which the structures that have developed to provide concerns lead to new concerns that require new structures. Such concerns as pacifying social order in the group, signaling general discontent, coordinating actions, etc., the following structures emerged: egalitarian coalitions with collective practices of intimidation, sound signals uttered in unison, training and self-training, self-domestication, shared intentionality, and normative rituals. The most plausible versions supplement this concept. Сhoral singing as a ritual of solidarity promoted the ability to imitate and articulate. Mirror neurons and neural overlaps have played the role of providing mechanisms for imitation and association processes. The connection between \"labor\" and speech was complex and interdependent, mediated by normativity. Recruiting as signals of mobilization for collective action also made its contribution but only under the already established normative order. Social learning is in fact a special ritual of constant trial and adjustment which has grown out of a normative ritual. The establishment of a new order of sexual relations also played a role: under the prohibition of violence and rape it was necessary to involve partners. Speech replaced grooming, and those who spoke clearly, convincingly and/or sang beautifully received benefits in sexual selection. The totality of all these processes reinforced the concerns of mutual understanding which were provided by the rituals of naming with the following multiplication of protowords and further growth of linguistic complexity.",

      "abstract": "The article talks about socialization mechanisms: successive taking on of different social roles and status (preschool, school, adolescence, etc.), social learning, institutionalized learning, play, imitation, identification.Although the ability to socialize is an essential trait of human nature, at birth, intellectual, emotional, relational and behavioural faculties are only potential.To develop, they require a social context capable of offering the child multiple situations of social and emotional communication.Both education and socialization target the same result -the human being and its development.That doesn't mean that there are no significant differences.Education, in the limited sense of organized actions carried on with the consent of the person being educated, determines the birth of necessary human aptitudes already existent as genetic potentiality.The educational process unrolls through specific processes, in special organizations, while socialization can occur either as a consequence of a person's contact with an organization that is not strongly linked to educational goals or through pressure coming from his or her living environment (natural socialization).Socialization is a very complex process through which the human being (with wide social potential) is transformed into a social being, actively involved in the organizations to which he or she belongs while one of the most powerful socialization forces is, of course, education.It is education that offers the opportunity for professional manifestation of a person in the social environment, through socializing forces specialised in education.The success of socialization drastically increases together with the size of the educational territory.",

      "title": "Community readiness for emergency challenges: Psychological perspective",
      "abstract": "It is substantiated the necessity to develop a holistic system to ensure the psychological security of the community. It is emphasized that children and school youth suffer a lot from catastrophic events, that is caused not only because of lack of experience (knowledge, skills, response skills in emergencies) but also because of the age peculiarities of their psyche (low stress resistance, which leads to stress and post-stress disorders due to inability to cope with a stressful situation). It is argued that psychologists in the education system should be involved in the process of creating a safe environment in the community. The «readiness of the collective subject of action» category is defined as 1) a set of qualities and knowledge of collective subjects (groups, teams, associations, state institutions) that allow them to interact effectively in a crisis, extreme or emergency conditions in solving common problems; 2) providing objective conditions for establishing and maintaining constructive interaction in the current situation. It is shown that readiness system consists of five vectors: 1) the ability of relevant government agencies and structures to provide the necessary conditions for the society's functioning, and their ability to organize the lives of citizens in a way that minimizes the probability of emergencies; 2) the ability of government agencies to effectively organize the process of preparation for action in case of emergencies, the processes of monitoring and overcoming the consequences of emergencies; 3) the ability of state bodies and structures to provide medical, psychological and humanitarian assistance to victims of the emergency both straight in the emergency, and after the destructive factors performance; 4) the ability of the subjects to perform their professional duties in an emergency; 5) the ability of the emergency situation subjects to constructively/effectively solve various problems. There are highlighted the organizational and psychological dimensions of readiness; there are proposed four groups of tasks that should be solved to psychologically ensure the readiness formation. It is proposed the system of principles to involve psychologists who belong to various public or professional community organizations, and psychologists who work in the education system, to help victims of emergencies. Such system consists of 1) the principle of partnership, 2) the principle of openness, 3) the principle of voluntariness, 4) the principle of fair motivation, 5) the principle of the need to increase competence, 6) the principle of territoriality, 7) the principle of responsibility",

      "title": "Cultural Diversity within Group Dynamics in Sport",
      "abstract": "Social ties have been described as both assets and liabilities for athletes (1). On the one hand, social support is seen as a resource for athletes dealing with stressors in sport, and seeking social support is associated with positive outcomes for athletes including performance achievement, enhanced relationships with teammates, recovery from injury, protection from burnout, and task-oriented coping during competitions (2). On the other hand, athletes frequently report a range of stressors derived from social interactions or relationships that can lead to negative outcomes or unsuccessful performances. Examples of such stressors include coach and teammate conflicts, criticism from others, concerns about home life and friends, and conflicts with officials (3). The relationship between social support and coping is therefore complex: social interactions may contribute to athletes' stressor appraisals, however, social support can contribute to positive outcomes and successful performances. Emotions also play an important role in interactions between athletes and teammates, coaches, and other members of the team environment. Athletes' emotions can be affected by the social environment of the team, and athletes' emotional displays can impact teammates, coaches, and other members of the social environment (e.g., family members, spectators). Thus, athletes must manage their own emotions and cope with stressors to produce successful performance, yet athletes can also influence (and be influenced by) the emotions and coping of teammates, coaches, and others. By better understanding the dynamics of social support, coping, and emotion, we can advance theory about how athletes interact within the social context of a team and develop interventions to improve individual and team coping and emotion regulation.",

      "title": "Comparing Political Communication",
      "abstract": "Put broadly, the central concern of language and social interaction scholars is how interlocutors make sense to one another by means of particular acts of communication in the context of observable, situated interaction. In his discussion of language and social interaction as subject matter Sanders (2005) writes: \"That people succeed far more often than not in saying things that are coherent entails that they make them coherent by speaking in such a way, at such junctures, to and among such people, as to make their meaning recoverable\" (p. 3). Interlocutors' apparent success at communicating implies, language and social interaction scholars agree, that (1) they have a set of interactional resources (morphemes, syntactic structures, adjacency pairs, discursive forms, etc.) at their disposal that they can use to engage in observable interaction in meaningful ways; that (2) the meaning of a given interactional resource is constituted by its functionality in the specific moment of its use; that (3) the meaningful use of interactional resources has a systematic basis; and that (4) meaningful interaction requires the cooperation or joint action of all interlocutors involved in any interactional moment. It should be noted that language and social interaction scholars are equally interested in interlocutors' successes and failures at achieving meaningful interaction.",

Dissimilar social encounters often demand dissimilar abilities. Appropriate behavior in one case may be completely inappropriate in another. Insofar as there is a recognizable general social skill, everyday observation suggests that this usually improves during the adult years and does not deteriorate in later life unless sensory loss is severe or mental illness strikes. The special demands of institutional living might be alleviated through the efforts of sensitive care-givers, but professionals should be wary of accentuating minor problems. The vast majority of elderly people cope adequately with their social relationships without special courses.",

      "abstract": "Social interaction is pivotal to the formation of social relationships and groups. Much is known about the importance of interaction content (e.g., the transfer of information). The present review concentrates on the influence of the act of conversing on the emergence of a sense of solidarity, more or less independently of the content. Micro-characteristics of the conversation (e.g., brief silences, smooth turn-taking) can profoundly influence the emergence and the regulation of relationships and of solidarity. We suggest that this might be because the form of a conversation is experienced as an expression of the social structures within the group. Because of its dynamic nature, moreover, the form of conversation provides group members with a continuous gauge of the group’s structural features (e.g., its hierarchy, social norms, and shared reality). Therefore, minor changes in the form and flow of group conversation can have considerable consequences for the regulation of social structure.",

The benefits of teamwork can be subjective and objective; subjective refers to an individual who, while working in a successful team, feels satisfied and has a significantly lower level of stress than other types of work, while the objective benefits are a rapid and effective group response, higher quality of work / product, financial gain and efficiency. There are three basic groups of knowledge and skills in the team: technical knowledge, problem solving and decision making skills and social skills (communication in general, gesturing, listening etc.). Communication begins and ends every job, every deal and every project, nothing can function without it, and the atmosphere, collaboration, imagination, motivation and other essential components of the team depend on it. We also talked with Darko Privrat, founder of REDesign films, who described how teamwork works in real life situations, we also discussed conflicts and how to resolve them. In the end, we conclude that with willpower, great desire, perseverance and resourcefulness we can create a compact team and that is why only those who possess these characteristics are called successful teams",

Many human services relationships, particularly those with clients, come into existence because of distress, dislocation and disarray and involve high levels of emotion. As Camilleri (1996 p. 80) says in his elucidation of emotional labour, ‘the work of social work is the managing, displaying and controlling of emotions and feelings…’. Many human services relationships are centred on sensitive personal matters and are realised in intimate environments, such as private offices, homes or residential facilities. Many of the relationships will, by virtue of the nature of human services work, occur in circumstances in which diversity, difference and vulnerability are significant. Many of them involve or invoke strong beliefs about rights, morality and justice. Many also expose or aggravate discord about intervention methods and practices, and program and organisational arrangements. Strong feelings, disparate expectations, capacities and passions, alone or in combination, can distort, fracture and stunt relationships. On the other hand, emotional intensity, intimacy and power imbalances can fertilise inappropriate relationships. Both relationships that sour, and those that flourish too vigorously, might attract the attention of the law.",

Los hombres para formar una comunidad tienen que comunicarse, porque participan unos con otros sus modos de ser y de esa manera adquieren nuevos significados; pero es preciso tener en cuenta elementos adversos que atentan contra la comunicacion: el rumor y el ruido, y factores que intervienen en una satisfactoria comunicacion: la empatia y la retroalimentacion .A pesar de las limitaciones participativas, los medios de difusion masiva han favorecido un innegable enriquecimiento cultural a nuestros pueblos ampliando la accion formadora de las escuelas y otras instituciones, y ofreciendo un esparcimiento accesible para las grandes mayorias. En las situaciones mas opresivas en que la historia latinoamericana se ha visto comprometida en esta ultima decada, pueden encontrarse rasgos de una comunicacion liberadora: Apoyo mutuo de los sectores marginados economica y socialmente, defensa ante medidas arbitrarias de represion, ayuda internacional de emergencia, etc, aunque los dones creados para el progreso y la comunicacion no los eximimos de un discernimiento critico de abismales murallas de incomunicacion que aun existen en Latinoamerica. La formacion de un comunicador esta situada en su forma de elevarse digno e interviniendo con rasgos profundos de convivencia fraterna abierta y sin limites. Seria bueno senalar como el hombre moderno, tan sofisticado en su tecnologia y tan abierto al progreso ha descuidado su capacidad comunicativa para sostener relaciones mas profundas y fraternas.",

      "abstract": "People working on behalf of population health, community health, or public health often experience confusion or ambiguity in the meaning of these and other common terms—the similarities and differences and how they bear on the tasks and division of labor for care delivery and public health. Shared language must be clear enough to help, not hinder people working together as they ultimately come to mutual understanding of roles, responsibilities, and actions in their joint work. Based on an iterative lexicon development process, the authors developed and propose a definitional framework as an aid to navigating among related population and community health terms. These terms are defined, similarities and differences clarified, and then organized into 3 categories that reflect goals, realities, and ways to get the job done. <i>Goals</i> include (a) <i>health</i> as well-being for persons, (b) <i>population health</i> as that goal expressed in measurable terms for groups, and (c) <i>community health</i> as population health for particular communities of interest, geography, or other defining characteristic—groups with shared identity and particular systemic influences on health. <i>Realities</i> are social determinants as influences, health disparities as effects, and health equity as both a goal and a design principle. <i>Ways to get the job done</i> include <i>health care delivery systems</i> for enrollees and <i>public health</i> in population-based civic activities—with a <i>broad zone of collaboration</i> where streams of effort converge in partnership with served communities. This map of terms can enable people to move forward together in a broad zone of collaboration for health with less confusion, ambiguity, and conflict.",

Not only do social interactions unfold in situations that range from the highly routine to those that are unique, the variety of instrumental and communication goals pursued in these interactions is equally large or larger. As these social encounters play out, participants may experience them as positive or negative, or as some admixture of these affects. In addition to these possibilities, studies of social situation perception have revealed several other dimensions such as formal-informal, cooperative-competitive, and superior-subordinate that social perceivers use to characterize social interaction contexts (see Forgas, 1979; Miller, Cody, & McLaughlin, 1994; Wish, Deutsch, & Kaplan, 1976).",

However, the potential of surveys as an instrument of social knowledge is not limited to this. Under certain conditions—the presence of meaningful conceptions, repeated and comparable investigations—the data of mass surveys—can be used as a means to study more stable and latent factors of social life such as sociopsychological attitudes, social norms, and sociocultural values. Factors on these different levels are interrelated, and hence the results of a particular investigation usually reflect complex phenomena that analysis can break down into discrete parts.

      "title": "\"Lunch keeps people apart\": Social interaction in a multilingual workplace",
      "abstract": "Language practices have been extensively investigated in the context of multinational companies, especially from a language management perspective (e.g. Angouri & Miglbauer, 2013; Tange & Lauring, 2009; Marschan-Piekkarai et. al., 1999). Previous research has explored issues of informal communication and language choices, indicating that social interaction in the workplace is crucial for information sharing and rapport establishment. However, little attention has been paid to workplaces within the knowledge industry (e.g. research centres), even though they are also experiencing a process of internationalization, and despite evidence suggesting that informal knowledge sharing in a university department is key to a favourable social climate (Lauring and Selmer, 2011). Thus, there is a need for research exploring everyday language practices connected to social interaction, sociocultural adjustment, and rapport management in the context of multilingual research-based workplaces. We investigate the role language (mostly English, but not exclusively) plays in everyday socialization between employees with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Language practices are tied to issues such as social identity, professional role and access to power, often to the detriment of the less proficient speakers (Canagarajah, 2013). These issues remain unexplored in multinational academic workplaces where English is the “unofficial” lingua franca for social interaction. Adopting exploratory interviewing techniques of grand tour and mini tour (Johnson & Weller, 2002), we aim to elicit an initial understanding of the communicative needs of five researchers within an international science department at a major Swedish university. A bottom-up approach is adopted to identify tacit knowledge about everyday language practices, the value of social interaction, and different experiences of intercultural communication. Lunch emerges as the key activity for social interaction and informal communication. The place where lunch occurs, the people involved, and the language they use seem to have a crucial role in the establishment of phenomena such as language clustering and thin communication (Tange and Lauring, 2009). Language practices during lunch are associated with two social groups in our study, with symbolic power attached to the language adopted by the more prestigious group. This, together with self-perceived low proficiency in communicative uses of English, makes informal communication face threatening for the other participants, who therefore avoid social interaction in English or limit it to strictly necessary occasions.",

According to the concept introduced here, symbolic contributions serve a substitute function, allowing individuals to continue to be accepted by society even when they are incapable of direct, or so-called “actual” contributions (e.g., math skills, language skills, social and moral competence). Symbolic contributions, such as verbal statements of intention to act, become necessary psychologically when the person lacks training/experience or is not free to act. Thus, lack of ability or absence of occasion to act leads to adopting symbolic forms of contributions. Correspondingly, people would not take these symbolic routes if they were competent, experienced, and in contexts that enabled them to act directly.",

The system of such determinants has been defined, which outlines as fully as possible various aspects that can contribute to the emergence and spread of criminal offenses related to corruption in society. It includes socio-economic factors (insufficient level of economic and social security of the subject of the declaration), socio-political factors (international armed conflict and lack of political will to combat corruption), organizational and management factors (failure of prevention subjects to take necessary and sufficient measures to provision of explanations of anti-corruption legislation, notification of the subject of the declaration about the need to submit a declaration and the deadline for such submission, difficulties in proving declaration of inaccurate information), legal (excessive complexity of the norms of anti-corruption legislation in the part of declaration, which causes difficulties in their interpretation and application, imperfection of the grounds of responsibility for failure to submit a declaration or declaration of inaccurate information, limitations of the legislator regarding the terms and number of opportunities to submit a corrected declaration), cultural and psychological (low level of moral and ethical standards in the activities of state authorities and local self-government bodies, tolerance of corruption in society, mental dependence of individual subjects declaration from corrupt practices). It is argued that the proposed system of determinants outlines as fully as possible the various aspects that can contribute to the emergence and spread of criminal offenses related to corruption in society.

Interaction - Mutual relationship and dependence between beings, things or phenomena; close relationships between two or more people living or working together or having similar thoughts or goals. Natural and convenient coordination between parts of something, a well-proportioned and well-proportioned union of the constituent elements of something; complete reconciliation between two things, mutual reconciliation according to a certain proportion. Mutual action that exercises two different things or phenomena, interaction. Interaction of socio-economic factors. Interaction between literary language variants. Development - The degree of social awareness and mental abilities, education, culture, moral perfection, etc. that one has achieved; the degree of progress that has been made in each of the different areas of social activity and society as a whole. (SFRY, p. 2271) Development is a multi-dimensional process that usually means a change from a less desirable state to a more desirable state. Development is a normative concept, and there is not a single definition all of it accepted. Some say that development must be time-bound, place-specific, and circumstantial, and cannot be simplified into a fully acceptable formula. Increasing economic effects, expanding the productive capacity of a country's economy, and technological advancement are generally accepted as indispensable conditions for development to be long-term and continuous, as well as industrial diversity and adaptability to external shocks. Economic development cannot be separated from other aspects of development, but its greatest value may be that it expands the range of human choices. Economic - Concerning the organization and direction of the economy, related to the material and financial situation of a country, a province, a branch of social production, a production enterprise, etc .; that has to do with a country's economy. Management - A conscious orientation process through which management personnel organize and orchestrate emergency force units, according to a common task for a common purpose, coordinating the various resources in the process of planning, organizing, developing and controlling. Emergency - Critical situation, difficult period.

      "abstract": "Some of the very same qualities that make conversation an important topic for linguistic attention also make conversation a difficult topic for linguistic analysis. First, in having a conversation – something which we all do virtually every day – we draw upon our communicative competence (Hymes 1972): our tacit knowledge of the abstract rules of a language, which is required both to produce sound/meaning correspondences within grammatical sentences and to use those correspondences between sound, meaning, and form in socially and culturally appropriate ways. Such competence includes ‘the knowledge of linguistic and related communicative conventions that speakers must have to create and sustain conversational cooperation’ (Gumperz 1982a: 209). Despite the ubiquity of our communicative competence, however, neither the nature of that knowledge, nor the ways in which it can be put to use for social and expressive purposes, is readily accessible to our own introspection. Rather, such knowledge has to be inferred through the analysis of structures and patterns in that which it is able to produce, i.e. in conversation. The fact that inferences about what is causing a particular phenomenon have to be made through observation of its outcome is one reason why conversation is a difficult topic for linguistic analysis.",

Therefore, face‐to‐face interactions lose their significance in everyday life, as modern media such as money or more recently the Internet step in between. The consequence for individuals is the process of distanciation. It has both a spatial and an emotional side: people who feel a sense of belonging can live far away from each other, and people sharing the same neighborhood may not even talk to one another. Social interdependence is ever more mediated and behavioral patterns often adapt towards a mutual ignorance. The consequence for societal subsystems is that they are increasingly disembedded. They follow their own logic only, without reflecting upon social concerns or society as a whole.",

Results show that the likelihood of an explanation being given in social‐contract situations was best predicted by intentionality and controllability; while in social‐rejection situations, the most important factor was to avoid personal reasons (related to the recipient). Excuse‐givers were even willing to blame themselves to do this. These results are discussed in terms of the need to extend attributional categories beyond traditional self‐serving functions to include social goals. such as the recipient saving face, to provide an adequate account of how excuse‐making varies across different types of social predicaments.",

Specifically, communicating emotions – internal states that can influence cognition and behaviour – can provide reliable predictions about the environment, thereby allowing others to adjust their cognitions and behaviours for adaptive action. For example, accurately detecting anger and responding with a submissive behaviour (or a greater display of physical threat) typically avoids a harmful or potentially fatal interaction (Dukas 1998). In contrast, where communication breaks down – for example, due to difficulties expressing or understanding a facial expression – significant negative consequences can arise including social isolation or physical or mental harm (e.g., Baron-Cohen, Leslie and Frith 1985; Hawkley and Cacioppo 2007; LeMoult et al. 2009). Thus, understanding how accurate emotion communication is achieved and why it breaks down is of central importance in facilitating the smooth functioning of all human societies.",

      "abstract": "Following an integrated approach to the management of childhood illnesses provides an opportunity to increase the effectiveness of the delivery of primary health care services through the efficient use of case management interventions. However, the potential impact of this approach to morbidity and mortality depends ultimately upon its use, and various constraints to use exist. There are constraints that are characteristics of the services themselves (such as long waiting lines); there are constrains within households (ideational, psychological, and socioeconomic); and there are constraints within communities (systems of transportation as well as geographic and social barriers). Unfortunately, inadequate theory exists to facilitate efforts to overcome the constraints which require behavioral and social change. This is due, in part, to the low priority placed by societies on the development of applied social science, as contrasted with biomedical science. Whereas the main factors that affect the utilization of health resources are well known, the relative importance of these factors in different conditions and situations (and their mechanisms of interaction) are not understood. Therefore, strategies which work in one context fail in another. This situation will continue until efforts are made to develop more systematic approaches to these experiences. However, the main challenge is to apply existing research tools and techniques and develop new ones which will permit the measurement and analysis of social and behavioral variables in a way that contributes to our understanding of them. The successful institutionalization of integrated management of childhood illness will also require the adaptation of generic guidelines to local communities. This process depends upon information on community beliefs and practices as well as on ways to use such information. Current techniques, such as rapid assessment procedures and focused ethnographic studies, must be further refined to meet this challenge.",

There is no need to substantiate the claim that inadequate communication, poor information flow within societies, or even purposefully distorted information, contribute significantly to the conflicts within societies, and also internationally. The discussion is based on the following assumptions, all of which have been subject to debate for some time: (1) the concept of 'knowledge' in academic debate is a useful analytical term, but what it entails should be given a critical consideration; (2) the term 'knowledge' has different meanings depending on the context where it is applied (e.g. academic debate on a certain issue is different from the debate on the same issue at the village level); (3) the academic conceptualization of knowledge is constantly in danger of becoming alienated from the general interest; (4) owing to the ever increasing specialization of disciplines, knowledge is being fragmented and dispersed into countless subfields; (5) so-called 'local knowledge' or 'indigenous knowledge' should be taken as a subject of serious investigation on a larger scale than has been done so far; (6) the national language policy has serious implications for the efficiency of communication and thus on the communication of knowledge.

Often in a language system, the events that make up a mutual association have the same value, so minor differences between them are considered insignificant for the system. However, subsequent linguistic studies have shown that as long as there are several units of commonality, essence, possibilities and causes in a language system, none of these units is insignificant for the system, they are in some respects different and require each other.\r\nIn order to convey certain information to the listener in a given speech situation, “one” (necessary, appropriate) is selected from several equally valuable events in the language system. The selected units are non-linear factors (factors associated with the conditions of speech, means, the process of communication, the state of the speaker and the listener, mood, attitude towards each other, national-cultural, age, sex; tone, speech, gestures; sign, etc. ..). Non-linguistic factors do not seem to be related to linguistic system, linguistic meaning, linguistic value in the speech system.\r\nHowever, every unit that linguistics evaluates as a non-linear factor (extralinguistic, paralinguistic ...) is very important for the communication process. Even sometimes in the process of speaking, non-verbal units are more important and valuable than speech units. This means that just as there is no insignificant event in language, there is no reality in speech that is not important for the speech system.\r\nLet's try to prove this idea with the example of tone.",

      "abstract": "Beyond assuring biological survival, every society must have structures that nurture the young, prepare them for social roles and responsibilities, and that successfully integrate them with a reasonable level of motivation into ongoing patterns of activity. Societies must also have institutions that reinforce a sense of personal commitment to everyday affairs: the lack of a stake in social processes contributes to personal demoralisation and deviant behaviour. Deviance may also occur because of biological vulnerability or handicap, because socialisation fails, because demands exceed capacities, or as a result of sub-group identification being in conflict with dominant values. Psychiatric disorders are a sub-set of deviant behaviour.",

      "title": "The Role of Negotiation in Managerial Communication",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Negotiation is a concentrated and interactive form of communication, in which two or more parts that are in disagreement try to reach ag reement that solves a common problem or reaches a common goal. Negotiation allows the creat ion, the maintenance or the development of an interhuman or social relation, as a business, work or diplomatic relation, in particular. Human communication theory is used in negotiations ever since its appearance, on a social ‐ political as well as on an economical level. Althou gh the negotiation process finalized through written communications, verbal communication has an important role from the point of view of the space that it occupies. In business, the neg otiations usually are “face-to-face”, at the negotiation table. Through verbal communication, a series of process are accomplished, such as: obtaining information, transmitting information , drawing up proposals, expressing opinions, establishing disagreement, with its block ing effects of the negotiations, etc. ( Hiltrop and Udall, 1998). The main problem of negotiators in the entire world is that after verbal communication parleys, they sense the need for nego tiations. After very or partially exhausting the clarified subjects of the parley tab le, there is sometimes a shift in situations, which determines reconsidering some previously expressed positions. Now, there are situations in which a partner is convinced that the decision has been taken in a way, whereas the other partner ‐ that the common agreement was another. The problem is if these omissions or misunderstandings are or are not unintentional. Some researchers have proved that personifing the style constitutes the most importan t step of the negotiation process. This personalization has two steps: establishing ones ow n style and evaluating the advantages and disadvantages that derive from using the respective style. Taking into consideration that motivations are those that determine the style and that the motives themselves are of personal nature, the adequate person to determine style is t he negotiator himself (Souni, 1998). To be able to make a correct analysis, that can determine the style, it is good for the negotiator to have three frequently met motivations: the desire t o repeat successes, the necessity to cohabitate, and the desire to be strong and to domi nate.",

      "abstract": "Over the last twenty years, organizations have shifted their structures from hierarchical, \nindividualized work to ﬂ atter, team-based work structures. While these ﬂ atter structures \nare beneﬁ cial to organizational outcomes in many circumstances, there are also a \nnumber of additional considerations to be made. First, as noted in multilevel theory, not \nall constructs and relationships operate in the same fashion across levels (e.g., as work \nstructure moves from the individual to the team level; Kozlowski & Klein, 2000 ). For \ninstance, effectiveness at the individual and team levels may look the same in terms of \nresults or outcomes (i.e., functional equivalence), but the structure of the construct is \nrather different. In team-based structures, individuals do not operate in a vacuum. \nRather, they must engage in interpersonal interaction and various other processes in \norder to accomplish the team’s goal. For instance, various team processes such as a communication and coordination that simply do not exist within individual tasks are \nrequired for successful task accomplishment at the team level. Furthermore, the social \nfactors inherent to teams as social entities can impact outcomes as evidenced by numerous studies on team process and performance (e.g., Kozlowski & Ilgen, 2006 ; LePine, \nPiccolo, Jackson, Mathieu, & Saul, 2008 ).",

Their empowerment is determined by several linguistic and extralinguistic factors, such as: mastering the language of communication by the speakers, social status of the languages used in multilingual countries, other parties’ behaviour, interlocutors’ different cultural backgrounds, interpreter’s loyalties (to the client and/or to the institution), and social norms of the speakers. This study deals with a number of communicative, social and pragmatic features, as well as it reveals the level of the interpreters’ power and responsibility for a successful outcome of communication. The main conclusion is that, even if traditionally they are depicted as a mere language conduits, neutral and invisible, the interpreters in social services turn out to be very visible actors. Their agency is flexible, e.i. it changes depending on the particular interaction, and their empowerment consists in making every communication as easy as possible for people deprived of such the agency.",

En sus diferentes manifestaciones, el malestar puede ser factor de transformación y de progreso social, y dar origen a movimientos sociales y demandas de cambio compartidas por amplios sectores de la sociedad. No obstante, también puede generar apatía o desafección política sin que el descontento tenga una expresión estructurada a través de demandas específicas. Asimismo, la falta de respuesta al malestar por parte de gobiernos e instituciones, así como las respuestas que no son sostenibles en el tiempo, pueden generar grandes tensiones, conflictividad e inestabilidad. Abordar los factores que originan el malestar es, por lo tanto, fundamental para evitar niveles crecientes de conflictividad, expresiones de violencia y crisis de representación y legitimidad democrática que obstaculizan el desempeño económico (CEPAL, 2018).",

With regard to the former, its scientific interest remained purely static-descriptive (as in the disciplines, now mostly obsolete, of sociometrics and sociography). In particular, the study of variation in language was either perceived against a historical background, or studied in the context of modern society; these interests crystallized respectively around the kernel disciplines of historical dialectology (with its emphasis on Worter und Sachen, in the tradition of the Swiss dialectologist Jakob Jud; 1882-1952), and around the burgeoning discipline of sociolinguistics in its extended form, where the object of study included not only the regional dialects of a language, but also other, socially stratified and gender-determined varieties of speaking, later augmented by an interest in professional speech, religious discourse, baby, children’s and adolescents' talk, speech characteristic of certain current genres (such as rapping), and so on.

Examples include teamwork, interorganizational partnerships, and community-wide coalitions. All are needed to respond to complicated practice problems, particularly ones characterized by co-occurring and interlocking needs. A family of “c-words” (e.g., consultation, coordination) is employed in many macro-level initiatives. Collaboration is the most difficult to develop, institutionalize, and sustain because it requires explicit recognition of, and new provisions for, interdependent relationships among participants. Notwithstanding the attendant challenges, collaborative practice increasingly is a requirement in multiple sectors of social work practice, including mental health, substance abuse, school social work, complex, anti-poverty initiatives, international social work, and workforce development. Beyond interprofessional collaboration, new working relationships with service users connect collaborative practice with empowerment theory and are a distinctive feature of social work practice.",

After socialization factors and the age at which the process are studied, we have primary socialization and secondary socialization (and continues), according to the assessment of society there are positive or negative socialization, and as awareness of how socialization process is distinguished there is formal or informal socialisation, depending on the objective pursued by already created effects, we have anticipatory or adaptive socialization , depending on the intervention of legitimate power we can talk about associative or institutional socialization after as contents and the results expressed in statuses and roles, gender socialization may be , professional, marital, according to methods of making can speak about planned, spontaneous, law enforcement, participatory socializing depending on the purpose we have societal, national, political, ideological-partisan socialization etc.. These types are not individualized in an environment amorphous, but they intermingle, they complement and, by correlation, manage to describe the complex phenomenon of socialization. The contribution of those who have defined numerous types of socialization should not be approached holistically, nor in opposition with each other, but as a complement to the comprehensive and specialized understanding of socialization. In this context, we propose a new criterion for classification, namely the extent of socialization, which assumes a total socialization of one partial socialization and a zero socialization, void. In regards the overall socialization, this is an ideal and not a reality. However, at least in theory, we could use this terminology as, for example, education sciences use the term \" ideal educational \" or how physics used the notion of \"ideal environment\". The concept of \"zero socialization\" could be the social equivalent of the expression used by Aristotel in his \"De anima\": a kind of \"blank slate\" for the socialization.",

Quite often, interpersonal, organizational, cultural, and other differences lead to tensions and conflict. Though CEPs enter into positions and situations in which conflict exists, or is likely to exist, few have been professionally prepared to manage interpersonal conflict. Drawing on a competence-based approach to communicating about interpersonal conflict (Cupach, Canary, & Spitzberg, 2010), this essay suggests key communication capacities, including motivation, knowledge, and skills to manage conflict, even positively transforming conflict in ways that build understanding and relationships. Conflict management is not about learning a single model or a specific script to “end all conflicts.” Instead, conflict management involves developing competency with constructive practices through intentional, sustained effort.",

In other words, there will be no society without different forms of language since communications will not happen. Human beings use communication in different levels to facilitate their works and path of prosperity of life. Obviously, organizing and systematizing works in the society will require management in order to perform the duties properly whether on the level of the different administrative groups as it is expected and through a clear plan for serving various purposes (economical, political, financial, scientific and military…etc.) These reasons (The role of language in social relations (the field of administration as a model)) are the source and have led to conducting of this study, to demonstrate the role of language in administration, because in our view’s language went through the entire gaps of administration, in which the skill of using language will have a clear and outstanding reflection on affairs of administrative commands, since both of them (language and administration) are social phenomenon. The communication principle is the most important element and duty of both of Language and administration. Performing the successful communication, by taking advantage of (verbal and non-verbal) language leads to perform an effective administration and fostering a strong relationship between both human elements in administration that include managers and employees.&nbsp;In this research, after introducing administration and demonstrating its main duties, it illustrates communication; the types and styles of communication in the administration. Then, it elaborates) mainly on the directing as one of the duties of manager in administration, because the role of language will be appeared clearly in this duty of the administration.

This paper considers the linguistic process of presenting a professional identity, with particular focus on the resume as a very carefully constructed storyworld in which every linguistic choice ( i.e. referring expression) contributes to positionings that construct and convey identity. Just as with any story, through the choices that we make in highlighting one aspect of a job over another “our identities as social beings emerge as we construct our own individual experiences as a way to position ourselves in relation to social and cultural expectations” (Schiffrin 1996)",

According to Ochs (1996), stance is a socially recognized point of view or (p. 288) and includes epistemic attitudes, e.g., one's degree of un/certainty about some proposition (Chafe & Nichols, 1986), and affective attitudes, e.g., one's mood, feeling or disposition (Ochs, 1996). Displaying is crucial resource in the social construction of range of dimensions of one's social personae, including social status, social role, and interpersonal relationship. However, as Ochs (1996) discusses in her Local Culture Principle, the ways in which is displayed varies from community to community. That is, the ways in which language is used to index are closely tied to the local cultural expectations and preferences concerning the to be displayed. Thus, stranger to particular community or FL learner entering new community would need to be aware of such local cultural expectations and preferences and the kinds of social personae associated with particular stances in order to accurately convey his or her point of view or attitude to other members of that community. For instance, while expressing less formal by calling professor by his or her first name in graduate school setting may be allowed in the U.S., it is expected that professor in Japanese setting is to be called by his or her last name with the title sensei attached, otherwise the student would be viewed as rude by not paying the expected respect. Thus, when an American learner of Japanese enters Japanese graduate school community, he or she needs to be aware of such expectations and discover other ways in which less formal could be expressed to professor in Japanese.",

      "abstract": "Rapport is a term that describes interactions between people, whether they are meeting for the first time or are longtime friends. The experience of rapport is only measurable at the dyadic or group level because it is established via a perception-action feedback loop within a dyad, based on individuals sending and interpreting each others nonverbal signals as intentions to affiliate (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). Therefore, the experience of rapport is molded by characteristics of the interacting patners, especially by their expressivity (i.e., how much they reveal their feelings through observable expressions, such as smiling and gesturing) as well as by interpersonal judgment accuracy (i.e., the ability to correctly perceive a social partners characteristics such as personality traits). Because of the importance of individuals social skills in establishing rapport, one particular individual characteristic of interest is age, because it denotes a level of expertise based on the accumulation of social experiences over time (Hess, Osowski, &amp; Leclerc, 2005).",

      "title": "The social and cultural aspects of communication in organizational change: the influence of social ties in the adoption of telework in firms",
      "abstract": "In firms, organizational change depends on a collective process of adoption in which the social aspect of communication plays a significant role. The interrelations between social actors permit a mutual structuration of individual adoptions of new technologies and new ways to work. Then, organizational change appears to be the expression of a collective resistance, not only inferred by economic and technical constraints, but also by the emotional and material ties between the individual and the different communities making up his social and relational context (the working team, the family, the regional and national community, etc.).A qualitative analysis of the introduction of telework in EDF and Gaz de France, based on interviews of teleworkers and of their managers, shows the collective and communicational nature of the adoption of this new mode of collaboration. Teleworking employees come up against the difficulty to share with non-teleworkers, in the communicational arena, a perception of space, time and others in which geographical distance is no longer perceived as an absence generating inefficiency. Without this share, telework leads to a negative evolution of social ties, taking the form of an emotional and functional isolation of teleworkers. In that case, the integration into the working team of this new way of working is compromised.The cultural analysis of the interviews realized in these two firms, correlated with statistics on the development of telework in Europe and in the United States, shows how national cultures have an influence on organizational change by structuring social ties. Thus, this analysis confirms the idea of a significant role of the social dimension of communication in the dynamics of adoption and implementation, in firms, of new technologies and new ways to work.",

      "title": "Forthcoming Issue on Game Theory and Political Economy",
      "abstract": "Game theory offers a rigorous set of concepts, relationships, and models that invite myriad applications to problems of political economy. Indeed, game theory can serve as a fundamental modeling technique that can bridge microfoundations of political and economic exchanges, with developmental processes and macro implications related to growth and distribution. Applications can range from localized interactions within workplaces, firms, political organizations, and community groups; to intermediate-level market, industry, community, or inter-organizational transactions; to encompassing national, regional, population, or global interactions. At any of these levels, game models can illustrate strategic responses of economic or political actors (individuals or organizations) to specifiable conditions concerning any or all of the following: prevailing social context—notably informal institutions (such as social norms) and formal institutions (such as mutually understood laws and regulations); available information (complete or not; accessible or strategically manipulated); agents’ motivations (material and/or social); and even levels of rationality—substantive (full cognition) or bounded (limited cognition). Applicable models may operate on the basis of given institutional context and preference orientations or may explore associated developmental processes, including adaptive social learning. Of particular interest are representations of one or more of the myriad social dilemmas (or collective-action problems) that inhabit political economy, associated exercises or distributions of power, and/or representations of potential resolutions to such dilemmas—perhaps with policy implications. Accordingly, this forthcoming issue of Economies seeks game-theoretic models based on classical, evolutionary, behavioral, or epistemic game theory that can be applied to one or more problems in political economy.

A theoretical and empirical approach to measuring social cohesion in neighbourhoods in England and Scotland is described. Some forms of social networks, such as contact with friends and participation in organised groups, promoted trust, attachment to neighbourhood, and tolerance or respect for others. Notably, neighbourhoods in which family ties were predominant tended to be less tolerant. The cognitive aspects of social cohesion (trust, attachment, practical help, and tolerance or respect) tended to be lower in more materially deprived areas. Both the material and social characteristics of places may contribute to spatial variations in health.",

      "abstract": "Language spoken and abilities in its social use are critical individual attributes, ranking with ethnicity, sex, and age in their association with access to life chances. Sociolinguistic variables have been neglected by sociologists, however, and language-related social problems are neither recognized nor understood. The structure of society is clearly the source of sociolinguistic discrimination, but a first step in the definition of language-related social problems requires more specific identification of: (1) affected populations; (2) the nature of difficulties and/or disadvantages experienced by those populations; and (3) the settings and circumstances in which those difficulties and disadvantages are most severely experienced. Moreover, social policies directed to ameliorization of language-related problems, just like those oriented to other social problems are formulated primarily by officials and bureaucrats on the basis of their perceptions of: (1) recommendations made by scholarly researchers (often in disagreement among themselves); (2) demands made by the affected populations (often in conflict themselves over goals and means); and (3) attitudes held by the dominant majority (sometimes concerned about others' problems but usually interested in minimizing threats to its own privilege). I discuss some implications of the interaction of these factors, and make some modest recommendations about how social scientists might work more effectively on sociolinguistic aspects of social problems.",

The same speaker uses different linguistic varieties in different situations\r\nand for different purposes.

The result showed that the social contexts\r\nor social situations that can come into play in controlling language varieties in Semarang\r\ncity are : relationship between participants such as the degree of intimacy, the degree of\r\nsocial status, and power and solidarity; occupational situation, and degree of formality. In\r\nthe degree of intimacy and the degree of social status, the lower the degree the higher style\r\nthe language used. Power is a relationship between at least two persons, and it is non-\r\nreciprocal in the sense that both cannot have power in the same area of behaviour.\r\nOccupational situation was usually characterized solely by vocabulary differences and was\r\nsimply a rather special case of a particular kind of language being produced by social\r\nsituation.

Multiple international agency projects and initiatives seek to build or strengthen both. Yet, while ‘capacity’ and ‘coordination’ are commonly used and are frequently identified as deficits that hinder improved programming in crisis situations, there is relatively little understanding of what levels of capacity and coordination exist in fragile settings and of how the dimensions of both might vary in crises compared to more stable and secure situations. Across the social protection and humanitarian sectors, frameworks for assessing and addressing capacity and coordination are fledgling at best, with little guidance available to those trying to improve capacity and coordination. (Guidance for cash working groups is an exception to this.) A better understanding of the evidence on capacity and coordination of social assistance during crises and of the main knowledge gaps is key to identifying solutions to overcome capacity and coordination deficits – solutions that are fit-for-purpose in situations of protracted crisis.",

Context (e.g., institutional, sociocultural, interpersonal, and communicative contexts) not only shapes interpreters' interpreting strategies but also other participants' communicative behaviors and their expectations for interpreters' appropriate performances.",

Institutional bodies typically embody deeply-held beliefs about performance\r\nmeasurement and target-setting which do not always sit well with cultures and\r\nbeliefs in community contexts. This difference may frequently cause tension and even\r\nconflict; it also creates challenges for a researcher engaging him/herself between these\r\ndifferent perspectives. The situation is itself further complicated when it comes to writing\r\nup research and making sense of it within the academic community, by the distinctions\r\nfrequently used by this audience. In particular, performance analysis of any kind is frequently\r\nassumed to be an uncritical, naively-objective activity, incapable of the subtleties\r\nof thought associated with interpretation and socially-constructed norms and ‘realities’.\r\nWe tentatively argue here that far from representing an externally imposed view of reality,\r\ndata analysis may be used as an arena (language) for describing views of collective activity\r\nthat are constructed in the interaction between the actors involved (the researcher being\r\nan actor him/herself).We posit this might be used to create a powerful (sustainable) story\r\nwith the full participation of community members.",

A three‐week daily diary study ( N = 178) explored psychological need satisfaction in two key everyday contexts: solitude and social. Holding constant the benefits of need‐satisfying social contexts, autonomy satisfaction during solitude was key to peaceful affect, whereas competence satisfaction during solitude contributed to lower loneliness; both psychological needs in solitude contributed to evaluating the day as more satisfying. Relatedness‐deficiency in solitude did not contribute to loneliness; instead, those who were relatedness‐deficient in social interactions felt lonely. Further, need satisfaction in solitude compensated for deficient needs in social contexts, reducing loneliness (autonomy and relatedness) and increasing day satisfaction (all needs) when social contexts failed to satisfy needs. Findings suggest daily solitude can shape daily well‐being and further attention is needed to understand and ultimately improve everyday solitude.",

The features of political thinking differ among cultures and periods, yet share omnipresent characteristics in all walks of life and interaction: (1) having the last say in decision making for collectivities; (2) distributing ideological and ethical importance through prioritizing specified social arrangements above others; (3) mobilizing or withholding public support for communal and group discourses and activities; (4) articulating and implementing cooperative or conflictual measures in managing social interaction; (5) constructing and projecting collective future-oriented plans and visions; (6) exercising power and influence by employing persuasion, rhetoric, emotion, and menace as well as through operating cover-ups. Each of those involve silences that: (1) underline conclusivity and endorse boundaries or compliance; (2) eliminate challenges to the prominence of political actors, or veil their shortcomings; (3) filter the consent, acquiescence, or dissent on which political agents, institutions, and ideologies depend; (4) smoothen or dislocate the socio-political order by affecting stability or conflict through supplying uncontested continuity or introducing rupture; (5) manage the political construction of time necessary to aid or resist political identities and futures, including the reconstruction of collective memory; (6) intensify or quash the impact of ideas, arguments, and events by modulating their circulation, reception, and transformation.

Many social scientists presently face a dilemma, on the one hand, in wishing to maintain a value-free social science and to refrain from evaluations of the relative 'goodness' of the various social classes; and on the other hand, in wishing to contribute in practical ways to the improvement of society where, for example, they may search for ways of helping lower-class children become upwardly mobile.",

Although talking with others may prove helpful for some, the social‐cognitive processing ( SCP ) model posits that interpersonal interactions can hinder adjustment if disclosers perceive social constraints. The current research marked the first time the SCP model was explored with regard to the dissolution of romantic relationships ( N = 217). Consistent with the SCP model, social constraints were associated with greater psychological distress, and avoidance of dissolution‐related thoughts and discussion partially mediated the relation between social constraints and psychological distress as levels of social support decreased. Social support may provide a buffer against engaging in avoidance behaviors in response to feeling socially constrained.",

Socioeconomic and behavioral information can be combined with sparse social structure data to derive quantitative estimates of a community’s social dynamics, allowing improved understanding and management of diffusion processes. We found that patterns of advice and use of media provide and effective way to identify the influential members of a community. We set up a large scale experiment in a rural community using our model and tested our proposed method of intervention and found strong evidence of an improved diffusion process which is significantly related to the communities’ network of advice. The adoption of an idea, practice or artifact is heavily influenced by social context, through both conscious and unconscious mechanisms. By targeting social networks, not social classes, age, gender groups or institutions, we can create the basis for the emergence of local organizations and businesses that organically provide the necessary support to achieve effective diffusion of technological innovations. In our experiment, the introduction of a few powerful ideas at the core of the communities’ social networks helped to create a social context where the new innovations created economic and social value. In addition, these new business create a richer social context from which further new innovations are expected to emerge.

      "abstract": "The dominance of professional institutions of public communication has a crucial effect on rhetoric and influence in contemporary public life. Rhetoric takes linguistic and social forms that lead to the inflation of influence, not just the overstatement typically connoted today by the very word “rhetoric,” but a chronic, socially structured inflation produced by the dissociation of public discussion and underlying issues of public concern. The issues discussed in debates readily accessible to the public at large – campaign debates, for example – often fail to evoke and to aggregate the solidarities of groups whose socially grounded backing could bring about new, realistic, problem-oriented policies.",

However, little is known about what people enjoy or dislike about these contexts of play, or how to best design games to support player preferences. Using open-ended responses from an online survey (N = 326) and a series of interviews (N = 16) this study shows that the solitary context offers immersive, relaxing, autonomous play, as well as the avoidance of unwanted social interactions. Social play, however, provides competence-enhancing experiences (via competition or teamwork or both) via interactions with others. What was disliked about these contexts indicates where design improvements to both the solitary and social play experiences can be made.",

      "abstract": "Abstract No matter the age, social isolation is common among older adults due to a number of factors. In looking at social isolation through the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model, the biopsychosocial factors intersect. Care models will be explored that involve the ICF model multi-disciplinary concepts of body functions, activities, participation and environmental factors. Developing more programs to counter isolation is critical for the health of older persons. (1) The experience of vulnerability may be overcome by banding together through assisting others or building a peer support network. (2) A holistic perspective is needed in promoting interventions that support functionality. Regular programming with body awareness and cognitive reflection is enjoyed by institutionalized older adults. (3) The role of social action and social justice in reducing social isolation is part of training social work students about the importance of culture and advocacy. (4) Collected ethnographic data found that the practice of remembrance reduces social isolation regardless of the program. Gardening and storytelling were found to be opportunities to reduce social isolation. (5) With unexpected longevity in individuals with hemophilia due to scientific advances, researchers also found shame, fear, and coping through social isolation to avoid social assumptions of health status. Care models are being explored to support this cohort. To conclude, Dr. Sharon Bowland will summarize our abstracts and discuss how they revolve around the ICF model of care that can be applied to the important social determinant of health area of social isolation.",

Minorities by proposing alternative and original ideas are often an agent of innovation and social change for societies. They create social conflict by proposing alternative propositions to the established societal perceptions. Minorities are, usually, numerically small groups that question social norms. Minorities influence people’s thinking, attitudes, and behavior by being consistent and flexible in their negotiation with majority members. Their influence is more often latent (i.e., evident on delayed, indirect, and private measures) than manifest. They affect the amount, and the quality, of cognitive processing of their messages (triggered by the different elaboration demands of the influence situation). Minority influence interacts with various situational factors such as social identity (in‐group or out‐group) and the task employed (e.g., objective or opinion) leading to different kinds of influence outcomes.",

      "title": "Reviewing the terms of inclusion: transactional processes, currencies and context",
      "abstract": "This paper sets out an overarching theoretical framework for explaining and exploring the processes of social exclusion, incorporating themes from the literature. It proposes that inclusion hinges on participation in social relationships enacted through ?transactional processes?, where currencies are assessed and goods distributed or withheld accordingly. ?Currencies? are not just financial, but also human ? evidence of human or social capital ? what people have, do or are. The currencies required depend on the objective of the transaction. However, even where people have currency, transaction may be prevented by inaccessible infrastructure (buildings, transport, communications, etc), or through failure to recognize currency. Both poverty (lack of capital or currencies) and discrimination (failure to enable, recognize, or act consistently upon, the presentation of currencies) need to be tackled. The components that make up social context are explored: the norms and socio-cultural objectives (economic, social, political, etc) and the transactions, currencies and goods which are consequently prioritized. Terms of inclusion may accommodate more, or less, objectives, currencies and goods, notwithstanding that some objectives will be mutually incompatible and that production of certain goods (e.g. land) cannot be increased. Objectives and norms impact on how identity is construed, or misconstrued. A typology of discrimination is described, along with its potential exclusory outcomes. Yet, changes in attitudes and priorities might reveal scope for redrafting the terms of inclusion to promote and preserve greater diversity within the mainstream.",

      "title": "Distinguishing four fundamental approaches to the evolution of helping",
      "abstract": "Abstract The evolution and stability of helping behaviour has attracted great research efforts across disciplines. However, the field is also characterized by a great confusion over terminology and a number of disagreements, often between disciplines but also along taxonomic boundaries. In an attempt to clarify several issues, we identify four distinct research fields concerning the evolution of helping: (1) basic social evolution theory that studies helping within the framework of Hamilton’s inclusive fitness concept, i.e. direct and indirect benefits, (2) an ecological approach that identifies settings that promote life histories or interaction patterns that favour unconditional cooperative and altruistic behaviour, e.g. conditions that lead to interdependency or interactions among kin, (3) the game theoretic approach that identifies strategies that provide feedback and control mechanisms (protecting from cheaters) favouring cooperative behaviour (e.g. pseudo‐reciprocity, reciprocity), and (4) the social scientists’ approach that particularly emphasizes the special cognitive requirements necessary for human cooperative strategies. The four fields differ with respect to the ‘mechanisms’ and the ‘conditions’ favouring helping they investigate. Other major differences concern a focus on either the life‐time fitness consequences or the immediate payoff consequences of behaviour, and whether the behaviour of an individual or a whole interaction is considered. We suggest that distinguishing between these four separate fields and their complementary approaches will reduce misunderstandings, facilitating further integration of concepts within and across disciplines.",

Fakat sapma davranış her zaman olumsuz özellik taşımaz. O şahsı yenilğiyi özendirmeyle, ileriye haraket etmeğe engel olucak tutuculuğu aşmak teşebbüsü ile ilişkili ola bilir. Sapma davranışı bilimsel, spor ve teknik sanatın çeşitli şekillerinden sayabiliriz. Deviant davranışın ne olduğunu tesbit etmek için önce mutlaka “toplumsal normlar” kavramını tanımlamak gerekir. Toplumsal normlar: yazılı emr, talep, dilek ve beklenilen uygun davranış (toplumca kabul gören) şeklidir. Belirli ideal örnek (model) normlar, insanların kesin durumlarda konuşmalı, düşünmeli, duymalı ve yapmalı olduğunu belirtiyor. Onlar boyutlarına göre farklılık taşıyor. Birinci tür: bu normlar yalnız küçük grublarda (genc grubları, dost grubları, aile, işçi grubları, spor takımlarında) oluşur ve mevcut olur. Onlar “grub alışkanlıkları” olarak adlanır. Örnek olarak 1927-1932 yıllarında ünlü Hotornskiy denemelerini gerçekleştiren Amerikan toplum bilimcisi E. Mayo normlar keşfetmiştir. Bu normlar yenilerle ilişkide üretim-askeri ekipler ve üstler için kabul edilmiştir: “Yakınlarınla” resmi davranmamak, Müdürlüğe, grub üyelerine zarar dokunduracak her hangi bir şey söylememek, Müdürlükle “yakınlarınla” olduğu gibi sık-sık görüşmemek, Kendi arkadaşlarından daha fazla ürün hazırlamamak. İkinci tür: bu normlar büyük grublarda veya bütün toplumda oluşur ve mevcut olur. Onlar “genel kurallar” adlanır. Bunlar adet, gelenek, töreler, kanunlar, teşrifatlar ve davranış tarzıdır. Her hangi toplumsal grubun kendine özgü davranış tarzı, gelenekleri ve teşrifatları bulunur. Sosyetik etik davranışlar ve genclere özgü davranış biçimleri bulunur. Ulusal çapta gelenek ve töreler bulunur. Bütün sosyal normları, onları sert uygulamaya konma bakımından çeşitleye biliriz. Bu normlardan birinin ihlali yumşak cezayı (kınama, dışlama, kötü niyetli eleştiri) gerektirir. Diger normların ihlali sert yaptırımlar (hapis cezası, hatta ölüm cezası) gerektirir. Belirli normlara uymama derecesi tüm toplumlarda ve tüm grublarda mevcuttur. Saray etiketleri, diplomatik konuşma ve nikah törenlerinin ihlali sıkıntılı durum oluşturur ve insanı zor durumda bırakır. Ancak bunlar sert yaptırımlar gerektirmez.",

      "abstract": "Social Workers, like asylum seekers, sometimes appear to stand in public esteem on the margins of respectability. In a territory that is ambivalent or one in which commentators are poorly informed about the demands of day-to-day practice, there is a tendency to shunt images of social workers into easy and negative compartments — incompetent, bureaucratic, controlling, permissive, abusive, 'politically correct', unskilled and lacking common sense, and so on (Ferguson, 2003). Within these labels, stories told about social work practice with unaccompanied minors are generally rather bleak (Stanley, 2001; Humphries, 2004). The formula used by some commentators is simple. They begin with an image of unaccompanied minors as vulnerable and needy. They argue for better resources and practices to alleviate need. They find that social services are poor, disorganised or defensive. They make recommendations for change. There is a confirmation of deficit and it is perhaps unsurprising that when looking for problems, problems are found and manipulated into shapes that give simple messages of need and blame that can rub out the complex lived realities that are part of everyday practice. Social workers are said to fail these children at a number of levels, both organisationally and in direct practice. For example, assessments of their needs are described as rather rudimentary, and the provision of care as a lottery, with a few winners amongst many losers (Kohli, 2007).KeywordsYoung PeopleSocial WorkerYoung PersonAsylum SeekerPsychosocial WellnessThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Accessibility has traditionally been perceived as a function of the space, or distance, between the origin of the individual (or community) and the destination of the activity¾the opportunity, service, social network, goods¾alongside the time that it takes to cross this space. Thus, accessibility is dependent upon the individual's ability to overcome space and time barriers, allowing them to reach the right place or person, at the right time¾and, of course, upon the availability to them of adequate resources to do this (Couclelis, 2000)1.

Le rire et le sourire créent des « communautés de connivence », que caractérise une compréhension implicite partagée de l'« incongruité » de certaines formes ou discours sociaux. J'aborde en particulier l'« incongruité » qui existe entre les codes officiels et les codes locaux, arguant qu'ils renvoient à des usages distincts et à des rires ou à des sourires différents. Le bon usage, l'arrière-plan historique et la situation sociale apportent des indices contextuels sur la signification du rire. Des ambiguïtés subsistent toujours mais, en se livrant dans l'action à une interprétation pragmatique, un acteur social compétent assure la continuité de la communication. Si cela vaut pour le langage en général, le rire, lui, accentue les ambiguïtés, et c'est cette particularité qui lui confère toute son efficacité sociale.",

      "abstract": "Social isolation refers to the objective lack of social integration. Loneliness, in contrast, refers to the perceived lack of social integration. Loneliness has serious consequences for the well-being of aging persons. Individuals who feel lonely tend to have poorer health, less autonomy, and lower subjective well-being than individuals who do not feel lonely. Lonely individuals even tend to become more socially isolated over time. While prevalence rates of social isolation increase with advancing age, only a minority of older people suffer from severe loneliness, however. Hence, loneliness is not necessarily a consequence of growing old, but rather, depends on specific risk factors (e.g., social needs, social expectations, resources, and competencies). Interventions therefore should be focused on these risk factors (unfulfilled social needs, unmet social perceptions, and lack of resources and competencies).",

Successful interoperation presumes that the interacting parties will maintain alignment in regards to their social state. However, alignment can easily fail due to the nonuniform observability of the relevant social events.

Facial expression can also impact social perceptions of faces by eliciting the perceivers' emotion and their behavioral tendency. In daily life, facial expressions are very complicated. For example, there might be mixture of multiple expressions, as well as fake expressions; on the other hand, social perceptions of faces are of great subjectivity. Further studies should expand the types of facial expression, and take the perceivers' characteristics into account.",

Considering that the total enterprise only came into being in the early 70s (taking The SSRC's Summer Institute on Sociolinguistics at Indiana University, 1964, as a reasonable date of departure) some progress toward meeting this challenge is undeniable. Such progress is particularly great at the micro-level where variation theory, discourse analysis, speech act theory, pragmatics, and ethnomethodological concerns and sensitivities have pretty much become modern day orthodoxies that often neither recognize nor remember their sociolinguistic co-origins. Nevertheless, precisely here, where the links to linguistics are strongest, there is hardly any link to sociology or to sociocultural theory more generally (none at all, indeed, except for the ethnomethodological corner thereof). If we look for linkages between macro-sociolinguistic efforts and the parent disciplines, the situation is even less heartening, because not only are such links exceedingly few and far between, but nothing approaching schools of thought or elaborated points of view are discernible. That being the case the likelihood of productive theoretical linkages between micro- and macro-sociolinguistic endeavors is rather remote for the forseeable future.",

This type of communication normally occurs in a diglosic community where two or more ethnic groups live together. In conducting communication, each of the ethnic group will apply and share their language and socio-cultural norms accepted by each other. All participants of communication are tied by rules that live in the speech community. Although they attempt to obey the norms, culturally the characteristic of each ethnic is still observed at the verbal attitude of their speech. In this case, we can observe the characteristic of speech act usage when speaking to other etnics, especially to Javanese and Madurese. Some factors which influence the etnic groups to choose the verbal attitude are a social distance, power, social variable, and cultural values.",

      "title": "Special Issue: Apologies: Introduction",
      "abstract": "The apology is a speech act which has deep and wide social and psychological significance. In both popular and academic notions of politeness it is perhaps the example par excellence of politeness at work. As Holmes (1998: 217), rightly, contends, “the apology is quintessentially a politeness strategy”. In both public and private interaction, the need for an apology signifies that something has gone wrong and needs to be put right. In terms of spoken encounters, to utter an apology involves the speaker acknowledging some perceived social transgression and the hearer receiving and dealing with this act. The apology arguably puts both speaker and hearer in a precarious relational position and necessitates remedial “facework” (Goffman 1971), usually involving some form of linguistic management. Furthermore, the nature of the apology can be very important in resolving a variety of types of conflict, ranging from uncomfortable moments in conversation through serious breaches of social and/or cultural norms by an individual to incidents with national or international political significance (See Zhang 2001; Harris et al. forthcoming; Jeffries forthcoming). As such, apologies, along with requests, have probably generated more research in the past two decades than any other form of speech act. Much of this research has emerged in relation to pragmatics and politeness theory but has also come from a variety of other disciplines, i. e., sociolinguistics, social psychology, philosophy and foreign language teaching.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Action and identity are inextricable from place. For example, people appropriate places for use in achieving certain goals and objectives; at the same time they are constrained by the range of place-making techniques they are able to access. In addition, social sanctions often involve the reduction of extensibility, for example through exile, imprisonment, or exclusion from certain communication media. Such changes use aspects of place to truncate an agent's ability to act. As places change, for example through the diffusion of communication and transportation innovations, agents often experience an increase in extensibility—the range of their potential action. However, extensibility can also be trapped in place, for example if one lives in an environment with lagging communication and transportation infrastructure. In short, agency functions with and through place.",

      "abstract": "Of all the devices by which the fusion of narrated event and narrative event is effected in narrative discourse, reported speech is perhaps the most sociolinguistically interesting. The appropriation of another's utterance, to be sure, is not confined to narrative contexts. As Bakhtin argues, “The transmission and assessment of the speech of others, the discourse of another, is one of the most widespread and fundamental topics of human speech. In all areas of life and ideological activity, our speech is filled to overflowing with other people's words” (1981:337). But Bakhtin himself has explored the patterns and functions of reported speech most fully in the novel, and other sociologists of language are finding it increasingly useful to examine the dynamics of speech actions and reactions in a variety of narrative forms, from oral stories of personal experience to myths, as a means of elucidating relations of speech, action, and ideology in the social worlds reported by such narratives (Labov 1982; Silverstein 1985; Urban 1984). There is a dual payoff here that is especially attractive to a language-oriented student of verbal art: Insofar as acts of speaking are of focal interest in certain kinds of narrative, an understanding of the ways that these speech acts are contextualized within the narrative can enhance our understanding both of how speaking operates and is understood to operate in social life and of how narratives are constructed.",

      "title": "Exploring the core ‘preoccupation’ of professional social work writing: A corpus-assisted discourse study",
      "abstract": "Within the profession of social work, the production and use of written texts is a high-stakes activity, playing a central role in all decisions around providing services for people, and at the same time used to evaluate social workers’ professional competence. Writing of all kinds pervades everyday social work practice, varying from case notes to inter-departmental emails to formal assessment reports. Despite the ‘writing-intensive’ nature of the profession (Lillis, Leedham & Twiner, in press), frequently, minimal attention is paid to writing in formal social work education programmes and professional training initiatives. Social work writing (often subsumed under the label of ‘recording’) is frequently the target of criticism in formal reviews and public media reporting of social work practice, hitting headline news when a case of extreme abuse or death occurs. Despite this, little empirical research has been carried out on these texts and, in particular, no corpus of professional UK social work writing exists. This gap is addressed by the ESRC-funded WiSP project (‘Writing in professional social work practice in a changing communicative landscape’, http://www.writinginsocialwork.com/) which brings corpus work together with discourse analysis in an ethnographically-framed, 3-year project. The specific focus of this presentation is on the corpus linguistic dimension of the research, and in particular what this reveals around the ‘core preoccupation’ of social workers’ writing. \r\n\r\nThe WiSP project has worked with five local authorities in the UK, exploring both the range of written texts produced and the writing practices of social workers. The newly-created WiSP corpus comprises 1 million words within 4,600 texts from the writing of 38 social workers within three UK local authorities in 2014-2017. The texts were written from the contexts of the domains of adult generic care, adult mental health care and children’s care and include the genres of assessment reports, casenotes and emails. The WiSP project also includes interview data (81 interviews with social workers and managers) and fieldnotes from 10 observation weeks. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will explore findings from the whole WiSP corpus, following the widely-adopted corpus-assisted discourse studies methodology of keyness extraction followed by thematic classification of key items and further exploration of these items through collocates, concordance lines and close reading of whole texts (cf. Leedham, under review, and studies in Taylor and Marchi, 2018). The specific aim of this paper is to use corpus-assisted discourse studies to unpack the focus or core ‘preoccupation’ (Baker: 2010:26) of writing in social work. While we explore the corpus as a whole in this study, care is taken to note the three differing social work domains, and three main text categories. In addition to the corpus data, we draw on ethnographic insights from the additional WiSP datasets, as described above, and in particular we use detailed comments from 11 expert insiders, including social workers, social work educators and representatives from professional bodies.\r\n\r\nWmatrix corpus software (Rayson, 2008) was used to extract key items from the corpus using British English 2006 (BE06), a 1 million word corpus of published general written British English (Baker, 2009), as a reference corpus. The %DIFF effect size metric was used to establish keyness based on the size of the difference in the occurrence of items in two corpora (Gabrielatos, 2018). Items occurring in texts from fewer than five social workers were excluded as our focus here is on typicality rather than idiosyncracy (cf. McEnery, 2018). The resulting 226 key items were then manually categorised into thematic groups using an iterative process of analysing concordance lines and collocate lists (extracted using WordSmith Tools, Scott, 2017) combined with researcher close reading of text extracts. Thematic categories developed from the initial manual keyness analysis include ‘time and numbers’, ‘interpersonal’, ‘people, roles, activities and services’, ‘describing and evaluating’ and ‘communication’, with each category adding to our picture of the core ‘preoccupation’ of social work. In deciding on category names and assigning key items, we drew on our awareness of social worker discourse from the wider WiSP project. \r\n\r\nFindings include confirmation of the extensive recording of communication exchanges, with differences in the ways social workers refer to their own and service users’ views, and in the use of quotations to provide evidence of service user views and actions. The extensive items in the ‘communication’ category signal the centrality of all types of communication in social work practice with some lexis indicating spoken interaction has taken place (e.g. call back, discuss, phone call, voicemail) and other key items signalling communication in writing (e.g. chronology, email, paperwork, uploaded). Examination of extended concordance lines reveals that social workers refer to their own communication differently to that of service users. Thus social workers advised, confirmed, discussed, enquired and requested where service users or their family members stated and, in discussion with social workers, agreed. In particular advised is used where the social worker is providing information to the service user rather than for the prototypical purpose of dispensing advice. In social work writing, stated and other verbs accorded to the service user or family are sometimes followed by a quotation (direct or indirect) from a service user or family member, providing evidence to support the writer’s commentary, showing the speaker’s strength of feeling and also perhaps showing some distance between the writer and the words quoted:\r\n\r\n(1)\t[PERSON1] stated [PERSON2] would 'kick off' and I explained …\r\n(2)\t[PERSON2] has told [PERSON1] to tell social care that the children are 'full of shit' and have lied about him. \r\nUse of quotations in social work writing appears to function as a means of providing evidence on which the social worker can base their evaluations.\r\n\r\nA common overarching theme within social work writing which comes through clearly in the keyness analysis is that of risk: with assessing, documenting and managing risk a core task of social work. Key items directly related to risk include concerns, high_risk, safeguarding, suffer, abusive, allegation, CSE (child sexual exploitation), and deteriorated. \r\n\r\nWithin the presentation we will discuss keyness analysis as a way of uncovering a set of ‘candidate professional lexis’ for further consideration. For example, social work writing tends to employ a particular set of lexis such as home environment (rather than home) and advised (rather than informed or told). Understanding and reflecting on such lexis may be helpful for newly-qualified social workers, social work students and educators. Controversy exists in social work around the use of what has been termed ‘jargon’, with calls for the word placement to be replaced by home and so on (e.g. Surviving Safeguarding, 2018). The issue of social work terminology arose in our consultation with expert insiders where we discussed the usefulness of professional language which succinctly encapsulates a range of meaning (e.g. educational establishment rather than nursery/primary/secondary/specialist schools and colleges) versus the potential for distancing the service user from social services through use of words such as contact rather than family time. The contribution of corpus analysis is to help to make visible the language within this ongoing debate, and we recognise there is a need for further exploration of candidate items through close reading and discussion with expert insiders. \r\n\r\nThe presentation will conclude with brief reflections on aspects of methodology, considering the interplay of manual and automated (Wmatrix) thematic categorization, and the usefulness of combining keyness analysis with additional data sources as carried out here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences \r\nBaker, P.

      "title": "Socioemotional Aspects of Entrepreneurship for the Classroom",
      "abstract": "There is currently great enthusiasm for entrepreneurship education and the economic benefits that entrepreneurial activity can generate for individuals, organizations, and communities. Beyond economic outcomes, however, there is a variety of social and emotional costs and benefits of engaging in entrepreneurship that may not be evident to students nor emphasized in entrepreneurship courses. The socioemotional costs of entrepreneurship are consequential: on the one hand, entrepreneurs who pour their time and energy into new ventures can incur costs (e.g., ruptured personal and professional relationships, decreased life satisfaction and well-being, or strong negative reactions such as grief) that can often be as or more personally disruptive and enduring than economic costs. On the other hand, the social and emotional benefits of an entrepreneurial lifestyle are often cited as intrinsically satisfying and as primary motivations for initiating and sustaining entrepreneurial activity. The socioemotional aspects of entrepreneurship are often poorly understood by students, but highlighting these hidden dimensions of entrepreneurial activity can inform their understanding and actions as prospective entrepreneurs. For instance, entrepreneurial passion, the experience of positive emotions as a function of engaging in activities that fulfill one’s entrepreneurial identity, and social capital, whereby entrepreneurs build meaningful relationships with co-owners, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders, are two specific socioemotional benefits of entrepreneurship. There are also several potential socioemotional costs of entrepreneurial activity. For instance, entrepreneurship can involve negative emotional responses such as grief and lost identity from failure. Even when an entrepreneur does not fail, the stress of entrepreneurial activity can lead to sleep deprivation and disruptions to both personal and professional connections. Then, entrepreneurs can identify so closely and feel so invested that they experience counterproductive forms of obsessive passion that consume their identities and impair their well-being.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental cause theory posits social factors as causes of disease as they encompass access to important resources such as knowledge, wealth, and social networks. While these social factors have been consistently associated with oral and systemic diseases, causality remains unestablished. Here, we estimated the causal effect of social adversity, comprising low economic and social capital, on the development of (1) oral conditions (OC) and (2) multimorbidity including oral conditions (MIOC) in a cohort of middle-aged and older adults over a 7-y period and assessed whether effects varied by age or gender. We analyzed 2 waves from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) (2011 and 2018). Social adversity comprised low economic (income) and social capital (community participation, social relationships). OC was defined as having 1 or more of poor self-reported oral health, lack of functional dentition (&lt;20 natural teeth), or edentulism. Participants with an OC at baseline were excluded. MIOC was defined as having 2 or more chronic diseases and an OC. Logistic marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting estimated the causal odds ratio (OR) of developing both outcomes, controlling for sociodemographic and behavioral factors. In a total of 23,366 participants, 14% experienced social adversity at baseline, with a prevalence of 17% OC and 7% MIOC at follow-up. Social adversity significantly increased the odds of developing OC (OR = 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7, 2.2) and MIOC (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.5, 2.0) at follow-up. The observed effects were strongest in the middle-aged group, with similar odds observed in both men and women. Our findings indicate that social and economic capital are causally linked to the development of OC and MIOC over time. We suggest that policies for healthy aging should prioritize action on social and living conditions.",

Under certain conditions—the presence of meaningful conceptions, repeated and comparable investigations—the data of mass surveys can be used as a means to study more stable and latent factors of social life such as sociopsychological attitudes, social norms, and sociocultural values. Factors on these different levels are interrelated, and hence the results of a particular investigation usually reflect complex phenomena that analysis can break down into discrete parts.

      "title": "PROBLEMS OF THE ADAPTIVE APPROACH TO THE SOCIALIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL",
      "abstract": "Relevance. In situations of forced resettlement, most Ukrainians demonstrate active adaptation to new living conditions, but they may not develop a psychological state of internal balance and well-being. The reason for this is communication difficulties, the migrant's inability to integrate into local communities. This raises the problem of \"social adaptation-maladaptation\" - the leading mechanism of interaction between an individual and a new social environment. Methodology. To prove the hypothesis: long-term psychological maladaptation leads to the marginalization of the individual and the formation of special marginal communities, it should be assumed that 1) subjective indicators of an individual's adaptability in a group are: a) understanding of the system of relationships and role relations in the group; b) acceptance of one's own role, accompanied by a sense of emotional comfort; c) experiencing a state of personal well-being in this environment; 2) the degree of adaptation - maladaptation of a person depends on: the significance of changes in the objective circumstances of life and subjective readiness for self-change. Results. Four limitations of the adaptive paradigm of socialization have been identified: 1) in difficult life circumstances, adaptation allows an individual to survive, but the quality of his life is significantly reduced and there is a threat of consolidating unproductive life strategies. 2) adaptation does not always lead to an increase in the well-being of the individual and can become a significant factor in his neurotization. 3) the reverse side of adaptation is the marginalization of the individual and the formation of marginal communities. Adaptation performs a stabilizing function in society, but also acts as a limitation for the development of personality and social innovation. An important addition to the adaptation model of socialization should be the idea of social integration of the individual.",

      "title": "An analysis of positive politeness Strategy in the film entitled “in good company” (a pragmatics study)",
      "abstract": "Communication has an important role in our life. According to Gartside \r\ncommunication is the art of sharing anything. In its vital sense it means a sharing \r\nof ideas and feelings in a mood mutual understanding (1986:1). Thus, people can \r\ncooperate with each other when they communicate just as they do in any other \r\nshared activity. Communication is usually defined as conversation, namely for \r\nsending and receiving message. If the message cannot be received it means that \r\ncommunication does not work well. In order to make communication run in \r\nharmony, the hearer should know the speaker’s aim. Moreover, everyday we \r\nadapt our conversation to different situations. Among our friends for instance, we \r\ncan easily say something that would be seen discourteous among strangers and we \r\navoid over formally with our friends. In both situations above we try to avoid \r\nmaking the hearer embarrassed and uncomfortable. \r\nPeople generally behave in accordance with their expectation concerning \r\ntheir public self-image or face wants to be respected. Face means public self-\r\nimage of a person; it refers to the emotional and social sense of self that everyone \r\nhas and expects everyone to recognize (Yule, 1996:60). Face has two aspects, \r\npositive and negative. An individual’s positive face is reflected in his or her \r\ndesires to be liked, approved of, respected of and appreciated by others. While an \r\nindividual’s negative face is reflected in the desire not be impeded or put upon, to \r\nhave the freedom to act as one chooses (Thomas, 1995:169). Therefore, people in \r\ntheir relationship need to preserve both kinds of faces for themselves and the \r\npeople they interact with the politeness utterances. \r\nAccording to Brown and Levinson (1987:65), certain kinds of acts \r\nintrinsically threaten face, namely those acts that by their nature run contrary to \r\nthe face wants of the hearer and / or of the speaker. For example, the hearer’s \r\npositive face will damage when the speaker insulting the hearer, and also the vi \r\nhearer’s negative face will damage when the speaker order the hearer. It also \r\ncould damage the speaker’s own positive and negative face for example, when the \r\nspeaker admits that he has failed in his job and when the speaker offers help to the \r\nhearer. FTAs are acts that infringe on the hearer’s need to maintain his or her self-\r\nesteem and be respected, http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/pragmatics. In order to \r\navoid or minimize to reduce the possibility of damage to the hearer’s face or to \r\nthe speaker’s own face, he or she may adopt certain strategies. \r\nBrown and Levinson sum up human politeness behavior in four strategies \r\namong them are the bald on record strategy, the positive politeness strategy, the \r\nnegative politeness strategy, and bald off record strategy. For example: \r\na. Put your jacket away. \r\nb. You must be hungry, it’s a long time since breakfast. How about some \r\nlunch? \r\nc. I just want to ask you if I could use your computer? \r\nd. It’s bit cold in here. \r\nThe example (a) is the example of bald on-record strategy, it shows that \r\nthe speaker does nothing to minimize threats to the hearer’s face. The example (b) \r\nis the positive politeness strategy. It shows that the speaker recognizes the \r\nhearer’s desire to be respected. It also confirms that the relationship is friendly \r\nand expresses group reprocity. The example (c) is negative politeness. It shows \r\nthat the speaker actually recognizes the hearer’s face but it also shows that the \r\nspeaker in someway imposes the hearer to borrow the computer. The last example \r\n(d) is bald off record strategy, the speaker is trying to avoid FTAs by asking the \r\nhearer to close the window. Instead the speaker expects the hearer to close the \r\nwindow. \r\nConsidering the phenomena above, the speaker should be able to produce \r\nthe appropriate politeness strategy for being considered as a polite person. \r\nFurthermore, the researcher is interested to analyze the politeness strategies based \r\non Brown and Levinson’s politeness strategy in a film. The film entitled “In Good vii\r\nCompany” has a good solid story of a middle-aged man dealing with both \r\nsupporting his family and keeping his job (bordering on a mid-life crisis), and a \r\nyoung man dealing with a new job, being alone, and finding what he actually \r\nwants to do with the rest of his life. The story puts the situation most in a \r\nworkplace, where the different statuses such as friend, client, boss or the superior \r\ninteract as the result there are many politeness strategy employed in this movie. \r\nSince there are many employment of positive politeness strategy found in \r\nthe dialogue in the film entitled “In Good Company”. The researcher tries to \r\nanalyse them. To clarify the research background, the following example will give \r\nclear understanding about it. \r\nAlex Foreman : Dad, I’m not gonna be a professional tennis player. \r\nDan Foreman : Well, look, sweetheart, being a writer is just as tough. (Taken from “In Good Company”) The example above shows that Dan as the speaker employs positive \r\npoliteness strategy 4, namely uses in-group identity markers. Actually, Dan \r\ndisagrees with Alex because he wants Alex to be a professional tennis player not a \r\nwriter. Dan uses the word ‘sweetheart’ to address Alex in order to minimize the \r\nFTAs (advise). It is not only to consider the relative power or status difference \r\nbetween father and daughter to be small but also to soft the imperative by \r\nindicating that it is not a power back command. Thus, Alex positive face is saved \r\nbecause she has been appreciated by her father. \r\nIn order to understand more about positive politeness strategy and what \r\nfactors influence the characters to employ the politeness strategy, the researcher viii\r\nintends to conduct a research entitled An Analysis of Positive Politeness \r\nStrategy in the Film Entitled “In Good Company”",

      "title": "Community Engagement",
      "abstract": "Community engagement is a term that in many parts of the globe has entered the vernacular of professionals in business, nonprofits, and government, as well as academics in higher education. It is both a communication practice and the subject of pedagogical and research interest. Although there is an outgrowth of theoretical debates that date back at least a century about the place of the public in democratic societies, much activity done in its name takes place without analysis or awareness of the complexity and consequences of both terms (community and engagement) and without consideration of democratic consequences. Shaped by multiple disciplines over decades, from planning to public health to public relations, it is now practiced in some fashion, usually in a physical community, by a variety of institutions. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with or in relation to other terms, including public or civic engagement, community relations, community journalism, community organizing, participatory culture, public or community participation, service learning, and public scholarship. The purpose of these programs typically is to solicit public input into institutional plans or projects. Some engagement programs are motivated by a desire to mitigate public resistance to institutional decisions or to satisfy a requirement of a government agency or a philanthropic organization. Some programs do, however, stem from a sincere principle about inclusion of the public. Higher education has taken up service learning and public scholarship usually out of more altruistic motives, while departments in communication fields, including journalism and public relations, are attuned to career possibilities, recognizing that communication practitioners are among key employees conducting institutionalized programs. While community engagement has become widespread, the rise of authoritarianism and anti-institutional sentiments in recent years challenges assumptions about the benefits of public participation where political forces seek to override professional expertise with popular opinion. The rise of social media has given members of the public better means to organize and confront institutions, but without a lasting improvement in democratic and inclusive processes and outcomes. Another trend has been in the use of technology to enable virtual interaction over time by members of physical communities, which may or may not strengthen communities of place and civic participation. Meanwhile, new marketing applications are extending engagement beyond geographic communities to fans and brands, suggesting that the future of community engagement may become more commodified, less bounded by geography, and further disconnected from democratic participation.",

      "abstract": "Social exclusion has become one of the important themes in contemporary social policy all over the world. While there is a considerable debate about the precise meaning of the term and some of the most useful definitions have sought to emphasize that social exclusion is concerned with the ‘inability to participate effectively in economic, social, and cultural life and, in some characteristics, alienation and distance from mainstream society. In contrast to poverty and unemployment which focus on individuals or households, social exclusion is primarily concerned with the relationship between the individual and society, and the dynamics of that relationship. In fact, in many ways, it appears useful to emphasize similarities between the debates about social exclusion and the debates about the barriers generated by disability. In the latter case, it is well recognized that some physical or mental disability can generate a powerful barrier to the ability to interact with society and that the state has some obligation to reduce or remove these barriers. In a similar way, one can see social exclusion among non-disabled groups as socially generated barriers that reduce the ability of the excluded individuals to interact with society. Applying ‘social exclusion’ to children necessitates further considerations. Since children are citizens who are entitled to rights and capabilities in their own right, ‘social exclusion’ is an issue violating their rights and capabilities directly, which is recognized in the Convention of the Rights of the Child and national legislation governing the rights of children (UNICEF, 1989; BMFSFJ, 1998). At the same time, since children are growing to be adults, and decisions, choices, and opportunities in childhood will crucially affect their position as adults, the impact of their economic, social, educational, and psychological development on their status as adults will have to be examined as well. The armed conflict in Kashmir from the last 22 years has resulted in about 100,000 orphans who are confronted with a range of issues like deprivation of education, livelihood, health care and above all stigma attached to being an orphan. The condition of orphans whose fathers were militants have to face a lot of discrimination in getting support in comparison to other orphans. The orphans are only discriminated and deprived of their rights because their fathers or other relatives were militants. This is due to lot of reasons, the primary ones being that government does not provide much support to orphans who are children of militants and government of Jammu and Kashmir provides some ex gratia relief to dependents of people who get killed in the armed conflict but in the case militants the family of the deceased suffers a lot. The armed conflict has also taken a heavy toll on the mental health of people particularly women and children. In 1980, 8-10 patients per year on an average visited the Government Psychiatric Hospital for the treatment of depression, but the number rose to 18,000 in 1994 and to about 50,000 in 2008. There is an enormous stigma attached to any mental illness in the Kashmiri society. The stigma is even more with girls who are unmarried as the parents think taking the girl to psychiatrists is inviting unwanted questions from the society. People with mental illness are secluded and treated with much contempt. A mere visit to Psychiatric hospital is associated with a lot of questioning from the people. The number of children with mental health issues is high but due to the stigma and to avoid to get secluded from the society the parents ignore such illness. There are also a sizeable number of children who are disabled owing to the direct exposure to armed violence and they are subjected to neglect, exploitation and discrimination not only at the hands of the society at large but from parents as well.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, interactive technologies are used almost everywhere. As a result, designers need to increasingly make them \"socially acceptable\". Previous work recommends \"subtle\" forms of interaction to increase social acceptability and avoid negative experiences. Although often appropriate, such uniform recommendations neglect the variety of social situations. We demonstrate this limitation in an experiment (N=35), by comparing the observer experience of different forms of interaction in \"face-to-face conversations\", a social situation rarely studied. Here, the typically recommended form of interaction (\"subtle\") led to a more negative observer experience than the usually deprecated form (\"suspenseful\"), in terms of affective experience and product perception. It also made the user appear less extraverted. We conclude by positioning interactions with technology not as separate from the social situation in which they are performed, but as a constitutive part of it that meaningfully relates to other situated activities.",

      "title": "Grassroots social innovation, co-production and foresight: community rebooted",
      "abstract": "The concept of ?social innovation? is still rather vaguely defined. Definitions range from innovations ?to meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations? , to ?innovations that are social in both their ends and means? . A largely un-mapped area of social innovations, although some might be quick in questioning their innovativeness, is that of ?grassroots innovations? including community currencies such as time banks, mutual exchange currencies or barter systems. These are driven by two key goals: firstly, to satisfy social needs of disadvantaged people or communities through helping to develop their capacities; and secondly, by an ideological commitment to develop alternatives to the market-based economy model adopting principles like citizens? empowerment, democratic organisation, solidarity, social cohesion, social responsibility and sustainable development. Such initiatives form examples of ?coproduction? in public services, delivering public services in an equal and reciprocal relationship between professionals, people using services, their families and their neighbours. Grassroots innovations and coproduction seem to be linked in a mutually enforcing cycle. They share similar features and challenges and lead to similar types of impacts underlined by motives such as social inclusion, equality, solidarity and solidarity. Foresight can claim to offer an appropriate approach for orchestrating their development by helping to overcome several of their common challenges and especially those related to capacity building, social learning, aligning different views and motivations under joint visions, social capital and trust building and linking local intelligence to higher-level policies.Foresight and grassroots innovations such as those examined in the paper are underpinned by the same principles of public participation, democratic deliberations, and equality facilitating coproduction and alignment of different viewpoints and interests under jointly defined visions and strategies. In this regard, foresight can help such initiatives in their development as much as they can help foresight upgrade its processes to deal with challenges of the 21st century that demand reaching out to society in trying to build a sustainable future.",

      "title": "The Discursive Characteristics of a Prosocial Self-Help: Re-visioning the Potential of Self-Help for Empowerment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-help activities tend to be conceptualized as a singular communicative mode, but one that is either empowering or oppressive. One alternative to rejecting self-help entirely is to redirect theorizing to identify, to articulate, and even to promote the ways self-help can manifest as a means of claiming and embodying agency within a society. I argue that self-help is provisionally a means of empowerment contingent on the discursive characteristics of the activities referenced. Empowerment appears to be cultivated in self-help activities when the communicative interaction is (a) embodied by self-help interactants who are part of a collective and who, as members of that collective, attempt to achieve social parity and (b) when the goal is to share knowledge gained from personal experience. Notes I am not suggesting that because people can make different choices (enabled by their status as active subjects), in a weird twist of logic, people actually choose, say, poverty by not exercising their own facility for self-determination. Frankly, that an individual perceives oneself to be empowered in some abstract sense may seem inconsequential when faced with insurmountable, material constraints. The complexities of oppression and resistance cannot be addressed in one short essay; there are no simple explanations or solutions. Thus, I focus on one particular form of resisting oppression and/or facilitating empowerment. Additional informationNotes on contributorsKimberly N. KlineKimberly N.

Behaviors may also change in response to changes in partner behaviors (Jones & Gerard, 1967). Global impressions of the quality of a social interaction such as judgments about responsiveness or rapport may be at least partly based on activity patterns and coordination (Bernieri, Reznick, & Rosenthal, 1988; Cappella, 1997).

Cross-border social dialogue has developed mainly in the context of supra-national policy frameworks, which are compatible with the different national traditions and practices and accepted by the relevant actors. Since such frameworks have so far only developed as governmental institutions for social standard-setting, e.g. the International Labour Organisation at a global level and the European Union at a regional level, cross-border social dialogue takes place mainly as cooperation with, and consultation of, social partner organisations with a view to shaping social policy. The central element of social dialogue in the national context - collective bargaining on wages and working conditions - has not been successfully elevated to the cross-national level, because the heterogeneity of national settings has not allowed for the creation of a suitable and universally accepted supra-national framework. Given the increasing importance of social policy at the transnational and global levels and the potential of cross-border social dialogue to improve its quality and acceptance in practice, representative social partner organisations should be given an institutionalised role in all the relevant organisations well beyond the ILO or the EU.",

Spatial mobility refers to differential capacities to move across the borders of gated communities, fortified cities, restricted areas, sovereign territories, private properties, or other forbidden zones. Greater spatial mobility might be sought for purposes of education, employment or trade, physical, political or cultural survival, tourism and exploration, or for maintaining various types of deterritorialized social networks. It may be coerced (e.g., refugees), semi‐coerced due to economic imperatives, or voluntarily sought for profit and status. It may aim at a permanent relocation, temporary sojourn, or a brief visit.",

      "abstract": "We explore the ways that perceptions of media effectiveness are affected by the societal culture, organizational culture, occupational (professional) culture, individual characteristics, and technology acceptance. This is an important subject to explore, as communication is essential to organizational functioning. The continuous drive for communication to individuals in different national and organizational situations around the world, due in part to globalization, leads us to ask: which medium is perceived as the most effective for each of the tasks a manager may be called upon to perform, particularly in different cultures? In other words, is the receiver getting the message that we intend, when the receiver is not in the same situation (societal, organizational, professional, etc.) as the sender? There are contexts of shared values, rules, and experiences that affect communication; words do not have the same meaning and value across languages and cultures (Macnamara, 2004). This means that the message sent from one context may not be the message received in another. If we are not communicating the messages we intend, then our method of communicating may be efficient, but it is certainly not effective. However, there is little research on the effectiveness of media types. We develop a framework highlighting the intersection of variables salient to effectiveness: societal, organizational, and occupational culture, individual characteristics, and technology the sender? In the conclusion, we suggest future work that might be appropriate, given the increasing interest in global communication.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and Depression\nThroughout history, humans have created various “instruments” for the survival of their species, including a need for socialization. These social relationships do not always occur successfully and when they do, there are behavioral changes, such as anxiety disorder, depression and even risk of suicide (SAVALLI; ADES, 2016; SOUSA; OLIVEIRA; CALOUI, 2018).\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (SAD) presents as main resources exacerbated fear or anxiety in social situations. Also called Social Phobia, SAD usually manifests itself before or during moments of interaction, as well as in situations where the individual feels observed or exposed to the approval of others (APA, 2013). This disorder is a consequence of one or several factors, whether psychological, biological or arising from lived situations (GOMES, 2014).\nThose who suffer from SAD tend to exhibit more reclusive habits, reducing their social circle to only their family members and to avoid situations in which they need to speak or even eat in the public. Physically, anxiety disorder usually manifests as hand tremors, flushing, nausea, frequent urination and/or panic attacks, signs that negatively influence the behavior of the affected individual and may cause a more intense degree of social isolation. Social Phobia physiologically impairs the functionality of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, producing changes in production and releasing of several important hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. This physiological change implies the maintenance of alertness, increases heart rate, alter body blood flow, and digestive processes and pupil dilation, these signals being the preparation of the body for situations of fight or escape. From the biological point of view, these characteristics are important for the survival of individuals. However, in the anxiety scenario, these effects are constantly manifesting, leading to the predominance arc of deleterious effects on the individual’s life. Early aging and cognitive signs, such as memory problems, difficulty in reasoning and decision making, are characteristics of anxiety (BELLETATO, 2019). Also, people affected by this disorder often perceive the environment around them as threatening and have negative thoughts about themselves and their capabilities (VIANNA; CAMPOS; FERNANDEZ, 2009).",

      "title": "Accounting for jokes: Jocular performance in a critical age",
      "abstract": "To joke is to embrace the illusion - and the reality - of community. Humor cements the social order as a performance that reveals cohesion through its validation by explosive, uncontrolled laughter. And, yet, jokes with their denigrated targets, their sharp elbows, and their pungent stereotypes can also divide people and groups, potentially creating alienation as well as allegiance. A joking culture (Fine and DeSoucey 2005) can either knit groups in shared understanding, making common cause evident through collective amusement, or can reveal the fissures in group life by exposing grievances through the telling or the response. Yet, for either way, in constructing boundaries of belonging humor becomes central to the creation of a local civics. Moreover, jokes and joking, despite their frequently tendentious nature, are often means of recognizing a group's relationship to civil society: to be joked about is to be cognitively - and potentially politically - relevant.In moments at which identities are sensitive and status positions unstable, humor can undercut consensus, and can even provoke collective action. Humor, no longer a matter of amusement alone, becomes a topic of shared concern, a social problem. A quarter of a century ago Elizabeth and Jay Mechling (1985) published a brief, compelling essay in the applied anthropology journal Human Organization on the implications of treating humor as sexual harassment. In their analysis, the Mechlings examined what at that historical moment appeared to be a curious, disturbing, and, to some, possibly amusing trend in which women were encouraged to file grievances over the presence of what they considered to be offensive and degrading joking in the workplace. Joking had always been in the penumbra of voluntary actions that leaven the culture of the workplace, giving employees a certain amount of authority and agency over the conditions of labor (Roy 1959-1960). The belief in a consensual basis of a joking culture, the Mechlings argued, had been steadily eroded by obligations that had more to do with the formal rules of the shop floor (Burawoy 1980). In this rendition of sexual harassment policy, the presence of ongoing teasing and joking could readily constitute a work environment under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and thus be actionable against management that didn't stamp out this free behavior. The rules led to even greater surveillance of workers by management. Under certain circumstances jokes could constitute unwelcome verbal conduct of a sexual nature, condemned by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines (Mechling and Mechling 1985:339). These rules apply to humor whether it is from a supervisor or from co-workers (and no exception is made for really, really funny jokes!) . As the Mechlings emphasize, in moments in which the propriety of joking is at issue, not to have a policy is implicitly to have a policy of permitting this humor.In practice, court decisions shed light on the particulars of cases. For example, in the case of Ocheltree v. Scollon Productions, Inc. [(4th Cir. 2003) 335 F. 3rd, 325] the court found in favor of a woman working in a costume production shop who was exposed to on-going sexual joking, finding that the men behaved as they did to make her uncomfortable. In the case of LyIe v. Warner Brothers Television Prod. (042006 CASC S125171, April 2006), which involved a woman hired to transcribe comedy writing sessions for the television show Friends who had been asked when hired whether she would be offended by sexual humor, the court found for the defendants. While exposure to sexual humor can constitute a hostile work environment, it may not always do so. Feminist legal scholars have criticized sexual harassment law for its over-emphasis on sexualized joking and remarks in the workplace. In the legal context, harassment cases that over-emphasize verbal interaction detract attention from and even stand-in for base issues like hiring and wage discrimination. …",

      "title": "Identity, Dignity and Taboos: Beliefs as Assets",
      "abstract": "We analyze social and economic phenomena involving beliefs which people value and invest in, for affective or functional reasons. Individuals are at times uncertain about their own deep values and infer them from their past choices, which then come to define who they are. Identity investments increase when information is scarce or when a greater endowment of some asset (wealth, career, family, culture) raises the stakes on viewing it as valuable (escalating commitments). Taboos against transactions or the mere contemplation of tradeoffs arise to protect fragile beliefs about the priceless value of certain assets (life, freedom, love, faith) or things one would never do. Whether such behaviors are welfare-enhancing or reducing depends on whether beliefs are sought for a functional value (sense of direction, self-discipline) or for mental consumption motives (self-esteem, anticipatory feelings). Escalating commitments can thus lead to a hedonic treadmill, and competing identities cause dysfunctional failures to invest in high-return activities (education, adapting to globalization, assimilation), or even the destruction of productive assets. In social interactions, norm violations elicit a forceful response (exclusion, harassment) when they threaten a strongly held identity, but further erode morale when it was initially weak. Concerns for pride, dignity or wishful thinking lead to the inefficient breakdown of Coasian bargaining even under symmetric information, as partners seek to self-enhance and shift blame by turning down insultingly low offers.",

      "title": "Genesis of group interaction phenomenology in complex social situations",
      "abstract": "Complex social situations, reflected in the experiences of group members, trigger the processes of group dynamics. These processes arise specific group phenomena, which reflect such experiences. In group interaction, there are processes and states (tension, confrontation, and conflict, crisis, trauma), which affect their member to feel discomfort, stress, frustration, traumatization. As a result, the social space of interaction has a change in the dynamics of integration and differentiation processes. According to the resources available in the group (values, status in society, creative potential), it uses available at the certain moment ways of cognitive and emotional processing of a complex social situation and produces group phenomenology. Group scenarios and interaction strategies can be classified as constructive and non-constructive ones, but their evaluation depends on the out- or ingroup affiliation of the one who evaluates the interaction. According to the resources, group phenomena can perform the functions of adaptation (maladaptation) of the group to complex social situations, as well as their acting-creative overcoming. In such conditions, the group solves two tasks that, depending on the circumstances, can compete with each other: overcoming social difficulties and preserving the group as a whole. Thus, in complex situations, in accordance with the dynamics of their development in the process of group interaction unfolds a consistent emergence process of psychological phenomena chain – phenomenogenesis. The scientific novelty of the research is that in contrast to the existing models and concepts of group dynamics in psychology, the concept of phenomenogenesis takes into account the social context of group interaction, brings together the whole spectrum of group phenomena, distinguishes their functions, and defines the tasks of groups",

La falta de dinámicas que respondan a las necesidades democráticas se ha manifestado en procesos que contradicen la funcionalidad y el pragmatismo que la misma sociedad requiere en los asuntos públicos. Asimismo, la incongruencia de la estructura de estos mecanismos con respecto a la realidad social del país se potencializa por la carencia de una política de comunicación estable y eficaz capaz de aglomerar las necesidades ciudadanas y materializarlas en acciones. Por ende, la comunidad no entiende su rol frente a las acciones públicas, distorsionándose el verdadero sentido de poder ser parte de estos métodos. Esta situación ha desencadenado la falta de transparencia en los procesos que sustentan el ejercicio de vigilancia ciudadana a la gestión pública. Por ello, es necesario entender la existencia de nuevos campos, en el que los ciudadanos tienen la capacidad de acercarse a nuevas formas de interactuación, hecho que les permitirá tomar partida en las diferentes acciones sociales de su entorno (Haro de Rosario et al., 2016). Dentro de estos escenarios, las redes sociales se muestran como espacios no solo de interrelación social, sino que también permiten que se desarrollen temas de interés público, lo que a su vez posibilita entenderlos como foros de persuasión política y de manifestación de pensamientos offline (McGregor, 2017; Miller et al., 2015).",

Some of these undesirable forms eventually fall under institutional taboo (legislative, religious and other prohibitions, sanctions, etc.), while others remain condemned within the framework of customs (morality, virtue). The forms that in the short term, and especially in the long term, prove to be quite acceptable or even desirable from the point of view of maintaining, reproducing, and sometimes increasing the level of social consolidation of community members, their tolerance, the quality of their mutual understanding and interaction, both spontaneously and over time institutionally selected as recommended, are accumulated and consolidated in social norms, standards, values, rules, laws, and ideological principles. Education is one of these most effective forms. The article shows what functions are performed by education at all levels and stages.",

Therefore the ability to work in multicultural groups is seen as an integral part of a student’s competency within higher education (Papov et al. 2012).\r\n \r\nMulticultural education pathways provide for many benefits. The greater diversity in communication styles helps development of intercultural competence (De Vita 2000; Popav et al. 2012) and increases performance in team project tasks (De Vita 2000). Equally it provides challenges due to different cultural behaviour patterns. As Bourdieu (1990) and the Hofstede (1980) model identified, each culture inherits its own societal behavioural norms. A lack of knowledge of the differences in members’ social norms and values may provide for conflicts. \r\n\r\nIntercultural competences is a relatively new field of study within literature. Due to globalisation students now need the skillset to help them work collaborative with different cultures. Intercultural competences has been defined as: “The ability to communicate effectively in cross-cultural situations and relate appropriately in a variety of cultural contexts”.

      "abstract": "Recent events in the United States have sparked a renewed interest in inequality, discrimination, and social injustice. Yet engaging in behaviors that enact social change is often a complex decision, for both members of marginalized and majority groups. Given the complex challenges people from different groups face when working toward greater social equity, it is imperative to understand the specific behaviors people engage in to enact social change, the decision-making process underlying these behaviors, and their downstream consequences. To this end, the proposed symposium considers how and why employees tackle concerns with inequality and push for social change within and beyond their organization, with a focus on the ways in which individuals leverage their unique social identities and/or account for the unique benefits and constraints associated with their identities. The papers in this symposium draw on both qualitative and quantitative research across organizational contexts (e.g., in Congress, among boards of directors) and multiple theoretical foundations (e.g., boundary and identity management, intersectionality, social role theories) to contribute to important ongoing conversations about diversity, inequality, identities, and social change.

      "title": "Religious Scepticism and its Social Context: An Analysis of Iban Shamanism",
      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes 1. By ‘social context’, we mean a range of social circumstances that surrounds and impinges on an event, and which is, in turn, shaped by that event; this is obviously congruent with the notion that action is both ‘context shaped’ and ‘context renewing’ (Heritage 1984 Heritage, J. 1984. Garfinkel and ethnomethodology, Cambridge, MA: Polity Press. [Google Scholar]), and it corresponds to Bourdieu's (1993 Bourdieu, P. 1993. The field of cultural production, New York: Columbia University Press. [Google Scholar]) ‘field’ as something both external to social events and formed by them. 2. Although we conceive of ‘communication’ here as largely verbal (speech acts), this should not preclude other forms of human communication (in combination with speech) such as facial expressions, body posture and gestures. These may be highly relevant to how people evaluate claims of ‘communicated acceptance’. Rarely, however, is such communication one‐off, but, rather, develops over time, such that evaluation comes to embrace temporally related sequences of speech and participation. 3. For South‐East Asia, this is reflected, in part, by the ‘non‐portability’ of traditional religious practices (that is, the claim that rituals do not work beyond their local settings, as ancestors are tied to ‘place’) and the individuality of religious experimentation (Reid 1993 Reid, A. 1993. Southeast Asia in the age of commerce, 1450–1680, Vol. 2, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. Expansion and crisis [Google Scholar], 132–201). 4. Wadley's research in 1992–94 was funded by the US National Science Foundation (Grant BNS‐9114652), the Wenner‐Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Sigma Xi and Arizona State University; it was sponsored by the Balai Kajian Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan with permits from the Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia. 5. The Kantu' are a closely related, neighbouring ethnic group. 6. All names used are pseudonyms. 7. Wadley did not record any specific activities related to 5 June. 8. Such as the continued epilepsy of the girl and muteness of the boy. 9. Interestingly, a year earlier this same individual had cited several instances of people experiencing poor harvests after casting off adat, which again points out the problematic nature of ‘belief’ and the need to attend to social context as influential in religious claims. 10. One anonymous reviewer suggests another, potentially relevant factor: the historical, pioneering expansion of the Iban beyond their traditional homeland in the Batang Lupar drainage. Are people in newer, pioneering communities more sceptical than those in older, more established ones, perhaps because of differing ties to ‘place’? Although we do not see that commitment to ‘place’ necessarily leads to less scepticism (although see note 3), this is an intriguing possibility and would obviously require more research comparing, for example, ‘homeland’ and ‘pioneering’ Iban communities (although ‘pioneering’ communities such as Sungai Sedik have been ‘in place’ for at least 150 years and have routine contact with those in the ‘homeland’, which is only 25 km away, as the crow flies). 11. Another anonymous reviewer offers the possibility that doubts about Belayong were particularly serious because they ‘intruded directly into the framed domain of ritual itself ’, rather than occurring outside the immediate frame of ritual as may be more usual (where, we suggest, the social threat implied by doubt might be muted). This excellent observation deserves further ethnographic and comparative research.",

      "title": "Bilingual and second language interactions: Views from Scandinavia",
      "abstract": "Studies of social interaction are intimately concerned with the variety of ways in which people draw on language and other semiotic resources to produce and make sense of locally situated courses of action. Through this conduct, they inevitably 'produce and manage settings of organised everyday affairs' (Garfinkel, 1967), and so ultimately studies of social interaction can be seen as explorations of the 'settinged' (Sacks, 1992, Vol. 1, p. 516) nature of social life.This special issue hosts a collection of original studies of social interaction taking place in a variety of settings, spanning from preschool playgrounds through social work offices to police sta- tions. The disparity notwithstanding, one common feature immediately catches the eye: the inter- actions examined in the studies make relevant a number of issues typically glossed as 'multilingualism'. This may involve the use of several languages together or, alternatively, the use of a single language variety which constitutes a 'second'1 or 'foreign' language for at least one of the interlocutors. More importantly, the primary goal of the articles is not merely to highlight the multi-languageness, second languageness or other languageness of the interactions but to offer in- depth accounts of the social and inescapably contextualised nature of the participants' conduct.Over the years, academic excursions into the area of bilingualism have chiefly been routed -- or, one might argue, de-toured -- 'through the heads' of language users. In spite of the thoroughly observable practices of social life, where people go about their business using more than one lan- guage, researchers have routinely attended to their language use only insofar as this would allow them to comment on the mental structures and processes involved in knowing and using several languages. This is particularly the case in studies of persons communicating in a second language. Here, the focus is almost inevitably on the various mental strategies allegedly drawn upon by speakers to overcome all kinds of impositions which presumably arise with the sheer fact that one is not speaking their 'mother tongue' (cf. Kasper & Kellerman, 1997). Such a mentalistic position rests on the assumption that people's actions need to be understood firsthand by reference to the workings of the mind, particularly its language faculty and any spheres involved in storing, pro- cessing and otherwise operating linguistic information.This is not merely a chronicle record of the field. The mentalist stance remains something of a paradigm in contemporary bilingualism and second language research (e.g. Meisel, 2011), as it does more generally in mainstream social and behavioural sciences. Nonetheless, new, radically social approaches are today contributing to broaden the field, and doing so with increasing legiti- macy. Although academic change is a cumulative and collegial achievement, it is possible to iden- tify two landmark events in this development.The first one comprises Auer's (1984) approach to bilingual talk and language alternation in particular. Auer, who was also inspired by Gumperz' (1982) work on code-switching and contex- tualisation, was first to apply conversation analytic (CA) principles to the study of bilingual social interaction. His analysis of Italian immigrants' children in Germany demonstrates in considerable detail how language alternation serves as a means for interlocutors to organise their interaction in particular ways, for instance, when reconfiguring participation frameworks, managing discourse cohesion or organising subordinated sequences. Thus, by locating the study of bilingual talk within a framework of sequential analysis, Auer's work offered a unique account of members' own pro- cedures for organising their conduct by drawing on the local availability of multiple languages.This procedural approach to bilingualism has its roots in an ethnomethodological view of lan- guage and its role in social conduct. …",

      "abstract": "Different schools of sociological thought have characteristic confusions about the concept of social class: whether it refers to individuals or households; whether it is about social inequality, social change, or social mobility; and whether the relevant inequalities arise from differences in being (identity), having (resources), or doing (activity, especially working activity). The idea is defended that inequality of welfare is the touchstone of social class, but welfare levels depend on preferences as well as circumstances and actions. It follows that class is about the unequal levels of welfare that standardized individuals suffer (or enjoy) as a result of the social distribution of the forces of production. Given this conception, the scope of class confusion narrows to the questions of how to standardize individuals appropriately and where to draw the boundaries of classes in terms of the appropriate welfare levels.",

      "abstract": "Individuals face many types of social interactions throughout their lives, but they often cannot perfectly assess what the consequences of their actions will be. Although it is known that unpredictable environments can profoundly affect the evolutionary process, it remains unclear how uncertainty about the nature of social interactions shapes the evolution of social behaviour. Here, we present an evolutionary simulation model, showing that even intermediate uncertainty leads to the evolution of simple cooperation strategies that disregard information about the social interaction ('social heuristics'). Moreover, our results show that the evolution of social heuristics can greatly affect cooperation levels, nearly doubling cooperation rates in our simulations. These results provide new insight into why social behaviour, including cooperation in humans, is often observed to be seemingly suboptimal. More generally, our results show that social behaviour that seems maladaptive when considered in isolation may actually be well-adapted to a heterogeneous and uncertain world.",

The fundamental theorem that underlies the model is that deviant attitudes and behaviors are psychosocial in origin, a product of the interaction of psychological, social and cultural characteristics. The model further postulates the following: (1) Adolescence is a critical time in the evolution of deviant behaviors. Prevention programs, therefore, should include a mujor focus on youth. (2) Deviant attutudes and behaviors are a product of socialization, of learning norms through social interactions. (3) The primary socialization forces in a youth's life consist of the family, the school, and peer clusters. (4) The influence of secondary socialization forces, including the community, religion, the extended family, media, and peers in general, is less than and is usually mediated through the primary socialization links. (5) Any socialization link can transmit deviant norms, but healthy family and school systems are more likely to transmit non deviant norms. (6) Peer clusters can transmit either deviant or non deviant norms, but the major source for deviant norms is likely to be peer clusters. (7) Weak bonds between the child, the family, and/or the school increase the chances that the child will become a member of a deviant peer cluster. (8) Prevention programs to reduce deviant behaviors should reduce risk factors and increase resilience in order to promote strong bonds between the child, the family, the school, and peer clusters and should ensure that these bonds are utilized to communicate non deviant norms.",

Su implementación permitió visibilizar identidades y experiencias diversas, promoviendo una comunicación más justa y respetuosa dentro de distintos ámbitos, como la educación, el trabajo y los medios de comunicación. El uso del lenguaje inclusivo generó debates en diferentes esferas sociales, ya que desafiaba normas lingüísticas establecidas y cuestionaba patrones tradicionales de expresión. Para muchas comunidades, su adopción representó un avance en la lucha por la igualdad, ya que ayudó a reducir la exclusión y la discriminación basada en el género, la orientación sexual o la identidad. Sin embargo, también enfrentó resistencia por parte de sectores que argumentaban que modificaba la estructura del idioma y podía dificultar la comunicación. Su uso promovió cambios en la manera en que las instituciones diseñaban sus mensajes, influenciando políticas de inclusión y fomentando mayor sensibilidad hacia la diversidad.

      "abstract": "(English translation is at the end of this document) This study discusses the phenomenon of conflict from the perspectives of organizational sociology, conflict approach and educational administration. As an interactive process in educational administration, conflicts can occur between educational stakeholders' specific spheres of authority, such as teachers, guidance counselors, psychological counselors or school administrators. However, they are homogeneous but also a structural part of a single and homogeneous whole. As individuals and groups become spatially closer, contact increases, and so do conflicts; distant cultures work less well. Differences in individuals as a source of conflict are the group dynamic that moves the group forward. As a result of such an interactionist and conflictual perspective, some of our conclusions will significantly contribute to educational administration and policymakers. Wherever there is an individual, there is culture; wherever there is culture, there is organization and conflict. Conflicts have been the driving and changing force of history. Preventing conflicts can also prevent development. As long as communication between groups is maintained effectively, work is beneficial. Still, when it starts to lose its effect, cracks that will collapse the social structure should be expected to emerge. Conflicts need to be managed constructively for these reasons. Özet Bu çalışmada örgüt sosyolojisi, çatışmacı yaklaşım ve eğitim yönetimi bakış açılarıyla çatışma olgusu tartışılmaktadır. Eğitim yönetimindeki interaktif bir süreç olarak çatışmalar, türdeş olmalarına rağmen, öğretmenler, rehber öğretmenler, psikolojik danışmanlar veya okul yöneticileri gibi eğitim paydaşlarının kendilerine has otorite alanları arasında, aynı zamanda tek ve homojen bir bütünün yapısal parçası olarak, vuku bulduğu gözlemlenebilmektedir. Bireyler ve gruplar mekânsal olarak yakınlaştıkça temas da artmakta böylece çatışmalar da artmaktadır; uzak kültürler daha az çalışmaktadır. Çatışmanın kaynağı olarak bireylerde bulunan farklılıklar esasen grubu ileri taşıyan grup dinamiğidir. Böyle bir etkileşimci ve çatışmacı perspektif sonucunda, bazı çıkarsamalarımızın eğitim yönetimine ve politikalarını şekillendirenlere önemli katkılar sağlayacağına inanıyoruz. Bireyin bulunduğu her yerde kültür, kültürün bulunduğu her yerde örgüt ve çatışma görülmektedir. Çatışmalar tarihin itici ve değiştirici gücü olmuştur. Çatışmaların engellenmesi gelişmeyi de engelleyebilir. Gruplar arası iletişimin etkin bir şekilde sürdürüldüğü sürece çalışmanın yararlı olduğu, ancak etkisini yitirmeye başlamasıyla sosyal yapıyı çökertecek çatlakların ortaya çıkması beklenmelidir. Bu nedenlerle çatışmaların yapıcı bir şekilde yönetilmesi gerekmektedir.",

      "title": "Resolution of Social Conflicts: Dominance, Egalitarianism, Spheres of Dominance, and Game Theory",
      "abstract": "Social conflict is defined operationally as occurring when the behavior of two (or more) individuals indicates that their motivational priorities are incompatible: they seek the same thing of different things, and both cannot be satisfied. Social dominance is defined as consistent winning at points of social conflict, regardless of the tactic used. Four problems generated by many current uses of the social dominance concept are critically reviewed here. (1) Dominance is sometimes equated with and is sometimes operationally defined as priority of access to resources. It is argued that dominance functions to resolve many kinds of social conflict, and not just those involving resources. (2) A tendency to describe all conflict resolution by using the dominance/subordination paradigm obstructs consideration of other relationships, specifically egalitarian ones. Egalitarian relationships are defined. (3) A Tendency to link dominance and aggression causes non-aggressive patterns of dominance(e.g., passive refusal to cooperate, manipulation) to be neglected. (4) When dominance is used as an intervening variable to define a dyadic relationship in many contexts, investigators may overlook important exceptions. Since costs and benefits of winning a given conflict are context-dependent, a dyad member may be dominant in one context but not in others (the \"spheres-of-dominance\" phenomenon). Social dominance can be based on aggresion (primary social dominance) or on leverate (secondary social dominance). Leverage is discussed and illustrated. Since social dominance is defined as consistent winning, regardless of what tactic is used, a smaller or weaker individual can sometimes be socially dominant to a larger or stronger one, often because of a leverage advantage. Both dominance/subordination and egalitarian relationships are phenotypes. Game theory can clarify the conditions under which particular phenotypes emerge; a model (Parker and Rubenstein, 1981) is presented, modified to account for leverage costs, that predicts the conditions under which various phenotypes should occur and when individuals with less resource-holding potential (RPH) should be socially equal or dominant to others with great RPH. Finally, the aggression of larger dyad members may be suppressed or modulated in some conflict contexts by means of affiliative social bonds (pair-bonds, parent-offspring bonds, or friendships).",

      "abstract": "Locke discusses that motives to approach communion (e.g., form partnerships), avoid communion (e.g., limit obligations), approach agency (e.g., enhance status), and avoid agency (e.g., sidestep conflicts) are universals because each has reliably – under certain circumstances – proven adaptive throughout our evolutionary history. Guided by upward, connective, downward, and contrastive social comparisons, people selectively invest in social goals that promise to be fulfilling (e.g., befriending likeminded others) and divest from goals that threaten to be frustrating (e.g., attacking stronger rivals). Individuals who can harness agency toward communal ends tend to experience better psychological, physical, and social outcomes; however, individuals differ in their inclinations towards agentic and communal motives due to factors such as life history (e.g., unpredictable rearing environments), life stage (e.g., parenthood), gender, and general sensitivities to costs/rewards. Variations in social motives across persons and situations are partly mediated by variations in oxytocin (which tends to amplify communal motives to protect and nurture close others and social bonds) and testosterone (which tends to amplify agentic motives to vigorously defend and enhance social rank).",

Habitualmente las investigaciones han destacado factores objetivos (cantidad de relaciones sociales, tiempo que duran, número de amigos…), subjetivos (calidad de la interacción) y autoevaluativos (sentimientos de felicidad, timidez, abandono…). Sin embargo, los aspectos psicosociales han sido menos relacionados con la soledad, especialmente la autoeficacia percibida ante situaciones de interacción social. Así, se estudia en una muestra de jóvenes la influencia de la autoeficaciapercibida en la autovaloración del sujeto al enfrentarse a experiencias afectivas y de tarea y cómo tales experiencias originan sentimientos de soledad y ausencia de conductas interactivas. Los resultados indican que la autoineficacia determina más significativamente el sentimiento de soledad que la autoevaluación. Igualmente, se constata la ausencia de relación entre índices objetivos y subjetivos de soledad. Es decir, una persona no se siente más sola cuando tiene pocas y cortas interacciones sociales, pocos amigos, etc., sino cuando no se cree capaz de abordar aquellas situaciones sociales que eviten la soledady mejoren así su calidad de vida.",

      "abstract": "Human social life is rife with uncertainty. In any given social interaction, one can wonder: Is cooperating with this person in my long-term best interest? Many people resolve to play it safe by cooperating rather than behaving selfishly, likely because (a) most social interactions in everyday life have long-term consequences and (b) the costs of alienating oneself from long-term social partners often outweighs the short-term benefits of cheating them. However, since trusting and sharing with others does not always advance self-interest, people might also learn through experience whether cooperation benefits them in any particular situation. Here, we review several lines of evidence suggesting that people initially decide when to share and trust based on the incentives that are present in their daily lives, but that they can also learn through experience to adjust their cooperation decisions to match the incentives of novel situations.",

The proper task of law, that is the one of regulating the cohabitation of people in an equitable manner, is harder in this context, but it can be enhanced with the help of the mediation carried out by religious communities, though the criterion of complementarity/distinction between the order of political conventions and the order of religious convictions is respected.",

      "abstract": "“It seems like they have to do all this form filling, their bosses’ bosses make them do it, but it makes them forget about us.” (Boy, 16, consulted by 11 Million, quoted in Laming, 2009, p 23) This chapter considers the nature and place of engagement and communication between social workers, children and young people within the professional and interprofessional context of children’s services. The interactions and conversations between children and adults within a professional relationship tend to offer a variety of challenges to the social worker in addition to those in other familial or social contexts. This is largely due to the nature and complexity of the particular professional roles and tasks that structure the connection between social worker and child. Such roles and tasks are dictated by social policy, legislation and practice guidance, which are themselves influenced by the prevailing social, cultural and political discourses of the time (Whitfield, 2009). Statutory requirements, policy initiatives, practice guidance and assessment frameworks change over time and jurisdiction, shaping the nature and importance of tasks such as informing, interviewing, consulting or supporting children. These factors have led to significant variations in the nature and importance of direct work with children and young people over recent decades. No doubt practice requirements will continue to develop in future years with shifting political agendas and ongoing social and cultural changes. To clarify the current context and expectations in England, this chapter uses the vignette of a social work student who is wanting to learn more about the influences that have shaped the professional role with children in order to help her understand why she should approach her work in a particular way.",

      "title": "Youth discourse in multilingual Mauritius: The pragmatic significance of swearing in multiple languages",
      "abstract": "Drawing from Dewaele (2010, 2013), this paper seeks to analyse the socio-pragmatics of swearing in face-to-face multilingual conversational encounters and argues that the conversational locus (Auer, 1984) of playfulness favours, amongst others, the co-occurrence of slang and code-switching (CS). Defined by Eble (1996: 11) as an ever changing set of colloquial words and phrases that speakers use to establish or reinforce social identity or cohesiveness within a group or with a trend or fashion in society at large, slang is more often than not associated with the speech of youngsters seeking to set up the linguistic boundaries of their in-group. Viewed as a global phenomenon which is transposed differently in local contexts by young people hailing from different social, cultural and linguistic backgrounds —including, as Zimmerman (2009: 121) notes, dialectal and sociolectal backgrounds — it acts as a marker of symbolic desire and consciousness of youth alterity. Such a situation can be endowed with further sociolinguistic complexity in multilingual situations such as Mauritius where the wide range of available languages endows speakers with an equally fertile repertoire of swear words derived from diverse sources. In keeping with the above, this paper focuses on a series of multi-party recordings carried out between the months of October 2011 and March 2012 and analyses the ways in which the usage of swear words in multilingual contexts can act not just as a reflection of speakers' communicative competence but also as an externalisation of their dynamism and creativity. The use of swear words in conjunction with CS is, thus, viewed as being a pragmatically consequential conversational act. Such linguistic versatility appears to be, therefore, indexical of a reflexive position that youngsters orient themselves to by allowing their linguistic output to be seen as a performance, involv[ing] on the part of the performer an assumption of accountability to an audience for the way in which communication is carried out, above and beyond its referential content (Bauman, 1975: 293).",

Community engagement appears in many of the voluntary standards relating to sustainability and reporting on sustainability-related matters. For example, the OECD Guidelines call on enterprises to seek and consider the views of community members before making decisions regarding changes in operations that would have major effects on the livelihood of employees and their family members living in the community and the community as a whole (e.g., proposed closures of facilities) and take steps to mitigate adverse effects of such decisions on the community. Effective community engagement must be built on a sense of trust between the company and the members of the community and organizations must take affirmative steps to enhance the community's participation and influence in decision-making processes and ensure that community members have access to information that they need in order to understand and evaluate the organization’s activities in the community.",

This syndrome of weakness can be remedied only if the collective intelligence of an area fails to activate development policies for education and culture of legality, stimulating communities practices and investing in intangible factors of development (such as construction and socialization of new knowledge, social capital, good practices of a territorial intelligence). There are many different conditions in which these invisible factors are materialized, differentiating the performance of certain areas than others. It is so spoken about external economies; of benefits of cooperation in a context of stable and repeated relationships; of use of trust as the glue of a local division of labour; of community spirit in the relationships between economic operators who share the same vision of things and the same story; of increasing returns triggered by localized dynamic learning; of sharing knowledge, professional practices and rules of social behaviour in order to favour social and systemic innovation. This new paradigm - that sees social cohesion as a premise and not as a result of the development - should ensure the broadest participation of citizens in the decision making processes of governance and therefore the sustainable human development.",

      "abstract": "Framing sociolinguistics within corpus researchIn this chapter we consider how corpora can be used in order to carry out research from a sociolinguistic perspective.Sociolinguistics is a somewhat broad term, with Labov (1972: 183) indicating that it can appear redundant as all language is social.Despite this, sometimes language can be considered from less 'social' perspectives e.g. in terms of a description of how it is structured or to the extent that it resembles other languages.Researchers like Wardhaugh (2005) and Bloome and Greene (2002) have identified sociolinguistics as involving consideration of social context and the relationship between language and society.Sociolinguistics can thus involve analysing aspects of language use as they relate to a person's identity or the community they belong to.It can involve examination of variation between individuals or groups and change over time.In particular, it can concern interactive aspects of language, resulting in corpus-based sociolinguistic studies that have involved concepts like discourse features (Aijmer 2015), politeness (Culpeper and Gillings 2018), and representation of identity (Johnson and Partington 2017).For the purposes of this chapter, we are taking a somewhat narrower focus, considering sociolinguistics from the perspective of speaker identity.We begin by reflecting on why a corpus approach is worth taking in order to answer sociolingusitic questions, followed by a short review of corpus studies of sociolinguistics.We then move on to a case study which is situated as a continuation of research on diachronic change in modal verb usage (e.g.Leech 2002Leech , 2011;;Millar 2009).While these studies have used written corpora, we have employed two spoken corpora in order to examine use of the modal verb may.The first is the spoken section of the British National Corpus (Aston and Burnard 1998), a general corpus of speech and writing collected between 1991 and 1994 (henceforth referred to as the BNC1994), which we compare against the Spoken British National Corpus 2014, a second corpus of speech from 2014 (Love et al. 2017), referred to as the BNC2014. Great challenges bring great benefitsOne consideration to be taken into account when using corpora to address sociolinguistic questions is that it tends to be easier to build or find corpora that consist of written texts, particularly if such texts are available in online contexts that already exist in electronic form (as opposed to say, converting the contents of a hand-written diary).Written corpora can be",

      "abstract": "The key thesis put forward in the paper is that it is common knowledge (in the technical meaning proposed by Robert Aumann) that forms the basis of the specifically human society and coordinates individual actions into social units (figurations), in the constant process of producing and reproducing society. Creating and maintaining common knowledge means different things in various social settings. In traditional societies and various local communities, building 'knowledge about other peoples' knowledge' can be based on dense interactions and face-to-face communication. In contemporary mass societies 'knowledge about other peoples' knowledge' is increasingly amassed by mass media and the symbolic middle men, who take over the initiative to synthesize and propagate content. Thus, a discrepancy appears between the local, experience-based knowledge, and the common knowledge shaped by centres (media, institutions etc.). This discrepancy, known as 'pluralistic ignorance', tends to weaken and dilute social ties, as more and more individuals do not recognize their experience, convictions and attitudes in the generalized 'social opinions'.

      "abstract": "Abstract Existing methods in social [oral] epidemiology primarily utilize statistical models that assume static characteristics of individuals and environments. While useful, an over reliance on these methods in the social and behavioural sciences can unnecessarily limit perspective and progress as even the most advanced statistical methods cannot capture complex behaviour over time given that systems evolve, environments respond, and behaviours and beliefs crystalize or deteriorate based on a variety of social, environmental and access variables. The recent consensus statement on Future Directions for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Oral Health acknowledges that dental, oral and craniofacial health emerge from the complex interplay of multiple factors at multiple levels over time and highlights the need for the incorporation of new and underutilized methodologies. Complex Systems Science offers a suite of tools and methodologies that are responsive to the generative mechanisms and processes that underlie population distributions of oral health and disease. Specifically, they assume intricate, dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, they facilitate the study and synthesis of interconnections between people (e.g. patients, healthcare providers and policy makers), how these change over time, any differences across settings, and provide an opportunity to guide future longitudinal data collection and intervention science more effectively. This paper aims to provide an introduction to foundational principles of complex systems, complex systems thinking, and methods found in complex systems science, including social network analysis, system dynamics models and agent‐based models, and offers perspectives on the challenges faced and opportunities afforded in the incorporation of these methods into the population oral health sciences.",

The language structure in itself carries out one reassuring function: at the base of the daily main routines the we find a continuous correspondence between our meanings and those of the others; it’s just during the daily routine that we share with others a common sense. In the process of reality social construction the individual surely comes to life with a certain social lean but he’s not directly a member of the society. He gradually takes part in it, through a step by step evolution in which the internalization of a common and shared language with the own belonging human community sets the first moment. At the same time, nowadays, we assist to a pluralism of languages due to the cohabitation, in the same urban context, of various cultures in interaction between them, and due to the mass media that invite us to give the right value to the differences and not to mystify the diversity.",

      "title": "Engaging Men in Difficult Dialogues about Privilege.",
      "abstract": "Male privilege is one aspect of social inequality that underlies much of the oppression and violence that occurs on college campuses. Mad Skills, a program addressing power and privilege with college men, is described along with general recommendations about how to engage men in difficult dialogues. The PIE Model is used to describe defensive behavior observed in college males. Male power and privilege underlie many problems on campus, and student affairs professionals must engage men in dialogues about these issues. Although masculinity encompasses positive, neutral and negative traits, some aspects of male socialization intersect with the unequal social distribution of power and privilege. This intersection can result in men's negative behaviors including oppression, interpersonal violence, and devaluing others (Kaufman, 2001; Sanday, 1990). Yet male power and privilege go largely unaddressed. Among men, lack of awareness about their power may generate resistance when they are asked to engage in conversations about power and privilege (Watt, 2007). Therefore, to make such conversations successful, we must understand and address the interaction of male power, socialization, and men's behavior. Similar to insight about other developmental processes (e.g., racial identity development), student affairs professionals can use this understanding to develop empathy, contextualize behavior, and embed dialogues in the language of the target audience. Professionals can then design and implement more effective interventions to deepen men's engagement in difficult dialogues. Our approach is centered on the premise that men are inherently good and well intended. We believe college men are more open to being held accountable for their behavior if they are approached in accepting, nonshaming ways that acknowledge their socialization. In this article, we use the term difficult dialogues (Watt, 2007) to include dialogues with male students designed to develop or enhance their awareness of the impact of male power and privilege. As Watt suggested, difficult dialogues are contextualized by a range of (a) internal and external challenges experienced by practitioners (e.g., discomfort, stress, and legitimacy concerns) when raising issues of privilege with students and (b) student and colleague defensive reactions to the dialogues. We recognize that individuals possess multiple aspects of identity (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, social class). For example, men from different backgrounds have different experiences of power and privilege (Kaufman, 1994). Despite these discrepancies, we focus our attention in this article on dialogues with men and male privilege. Rather than thinking of masculinity as a factor that is the same for men from all different backgrounds, we urge practitioners to conceptualize masculinity as one of many intersecting aspects of identity to be considered when working with an individual or group of students. In the following pages, we provide an overview of male socialization and its impact on college men's behaviors, attitudes and beliefs. We describe how understanding male socialization can help (a) demystify men's defensiveness or withdrawal from dialogues, and (b) identify ways to address privilege while positively engaging men in difficult dialogues. We use Watt's PIE model (2007) as a framework for conceptualizing men's reactions to difficult dialogues. Finally, we provide an example and share recommendations from our conversations with men. MALE SOCIALIZATION Although men's socialization experiences differ on the basis of individual, family, cultural, racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, and other factors, many similarities exist. The gender socialization process in which boys and girls are treated differently by family, peers, and society starts at birth and continues throughout one's lifetime (Fagot, Rogers, & Leinbach, 2000). Boys are socialized to adopt a code of behavior that includes independence, aggression, confidence, emotional inhibition, and avoidance of any behaviors that might be considered feminine (David & Brannon, 1975; Mahalik, Good, & Englar-Carlson, 2003; O'Neil, Helms, & Wrightsman, 1986). …",

      "title": "The maintenance of regional dialects in the social network of children aged 10-11 years: A matter of gender?",
      "abstract": "The linguistic diversity enduring beyond institutional pressures and social prejudices against non-standard dialects questions the social forces influencing language maintenance across generations and how children contribute to this process. Children encounter multi-dialectal interactions in their early environment, and increasing evidence shows that the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation is not a side issue but an inherent part of the general acquisition process (Chevrot and Foulkes, 2013). Despite these recent advances in sociolinguistic acquisition, children’s sociolinguistic usages remain under-studied in relation to peers’ social networks and the ability to use dialect for identity purposes. Our study focused on the child use of several sociolinguistic variables. First, we study a grammatical sociolinguistic variable consisting in the alternation between the regional variant (y) and the standard variants (le, la, les ) of the third person object pronouns in French (for example, ‘Comment tu y sais ?’ rather than ‘Comment tu le sais ?’ ‘How do you know ?’ ; ‘Elle y appelle des aimants’ instead of ‘Elle les appelle des aimants’ ‘She calls them magnets’). The regional variant is a remnant of the neutral pronoun of Franco-Provencal language and its usage by adults is strongly associated with local identity in the French Alps (Châtellain, 2004; Tuaillon, 1983). Second, we study general sociolinguistic variables which variants are found throughout the French language area (variable liaison, variable deletion of /l/ in the third person subject pronoun, variable deletion of the post-consonantal final /R/). A comprehensive review suggests that these general variables are sociolinguistic markers in French in adult (Nardy, 2008). Using questionnaires, we described the social networks of 117 10-11 year-old girls and boys living in the same restricted rural area. Thirteen native target children (7 girls and 6 boys) were selected from the sample, as well as 39 same-sex friends chosen according to their place of birth (native vs non-native) and the duration of their friendship with the targets (number of years they have known each other). The target children were recorded using wireless microphones during spontaneous dyadic conversations with friends of each category. Target boys, but not girls, used the local pronoun significantly more frequently with their long-term native friends than with their non-native friends. This adjustment mirrored their partners’ usages. Moreover, with long-term native friends, boys used the regional pronoun twice as frequently as girls. Such pattern of results is not found for the general variables. Boys aged 10-11 are thus capable of robust and subtle stylistic adjustments as a function of the social position of the addressees in their network of acquaintances and as a function of the identity value of the sociolinguistic variants. Moreover boy appear to be key actors in the maintenance and the diffusion of regional cues in local social networks, as it is the case for adult males in very similar contexts (Holmquist, 1985).",

      "abstract": "It is well known that social factors affect risk for mental illnesses and substance use disorders, as well as health outcomes of persons with these disorders. Social and environmental factors, in addition to their independent and combined effects, can influence genetic determinants of health and illness through gene-by-environment interactions and epigenetic mechanisms. Such social and environmental factors clearly have an effect at the individual level and should encounter intervention in the clinical setting. However, the social determinants of health and the social determinants of mental health exert their effects more broadly at the societal level and thus can be most effectively addressed through changes in public policies and social norms. Specifically, the social determinants of mental health—exemplified here by income inequality and poor education—are understood as being underpinned by unequal distribution of opportunity and, more deeply, by public policies (e.g., legislation that may not specifically pertain to health but ultimately has far-reaching effects on health) and social norms (e.g., cultural opinions and biases that set the stage for poorer health among disadvantaged groups). The greatest population-based impact for improving mental health and reducing risk of mental illnesses and substance use disorders will be achieved by optimizing public policies to make them more health promoting, and by altering social norms so that the health of all members of society is a priority.",

In contemporary society, the tendency of adolescents to join reference groups has a large impact on their behavior, because on the one hand, it can allow them to assert themselves, awareness of the desire to delimit themselves from family and school authority, but on the other hand, not all groups can have beneficial effects on them. The existence of numerous groups dealing with illicit acts, groups with recidivists or with a criminal record is a source of attraction for adolescents with social deficiencies, leading them to train in deviant acts and then delinquents who are highly dangerous for society (rapes, thefts, robberies). Group delinquency is characteristic of juvenile delinquency, the main acts being hooliganism, rape, violence, vehicle theft. Most juvenile delinquency behaviors can fall into four broad categories: theft, violence to gain a material advantage, violation of status laws (school dropout, absenteeism), and group or gang behavior received by others as a threat due to physical activity involved.",

Social infrastructure is defined as the group-level, interactive aspect of organizations or institutions that resides in symbols and interactions rather than in individuals or things. Entrepreneurial social infrastructure has three main dimensions that are associated with progressive community change: (1) symbolic diversity - a collective or community-level orientation toward inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness. Some examples include: interaction with other community members on a regular basis and in a variety of settings, accepting controversy willingly, and depersonalizing politics; (2) resource mobilization - communities need to be more dependent on their own resources for successful economic growth. Examples include: relative equality in the distribution of resources, willingness to invest collectively, and investing private capital locally; and (3) quality of linkages - both formal and informal networks within the community facilitate the flow of resources, particularly information. Network diversity, learning from other, similar communities, and developing more two-way communication flows are important aspects of linkage quality. Communities that have entrepreneurial social infrastructure are in the best position to elicit development and change because they focus on the process of empowering people for the long term, rather than focusing on immediate short-term solutions.

Growing evidence suggests that the answer involves the influence of both cognitive and social factors. Successful entrepreneurs appear to think differently than other persons in several respects (e.g., they are less likely to engage in counterfactual thinking but more likely to show overconfidence in their judgments). Similarly, successful entrepreneurs appear to be higher in social competence—the ability to interact effectively with others (e.g., they are better at social perception and adapting to new social situations). These results suggest that the principles and findings of psychology can be invaluable to researchers in the field of entrepreneurship, providing important insights into the factors that influence entrepreneurs' success.",

      "abstract": "Governance is a human activity and is therefore unquestionably about relationships. Relationships between public and private parties. Relationships in existing steering-oriented structures (the political administrator as guardian, magistrate) and also relationships in new forms of cooperation that are often focused on good relationships (government participation). Public-private partnerships are inevitably accompanied by conflicting interests that place different demands on interactions. One-size-fits-all does not fit there, but customization is required, with constant alignment with what is – and what is not (yet). And so the ability to make contact requires much more attention, and from there to explore and grasp perspectives. How do you work on the tensions that you find on your way? It is there that the method of communication influences how the process of cooperation and steering proceeds. This is not a matter of whether-or, but and-and. Both perspectives are characterized by a different relationship with those involved and a different way of contact and interaction. This article focuses on contact from a collaborative perspective. The classical administrative side already has a rich history, while the cooperation side is often still an unknown and unexplored territory. The central question is: how can you, as a director and public professional, deliver tailor-made solutions and therefore adapt to complex tasks? The authors look at complex situations from a communicative perspective and they introduce ‘appreciative communication’ as the art of aligning with what really moves people, as a frame of view of the inconvenience caused by the differences present. They highlight a number of generic tensions that can arise in cooperation situations. A case study into the approach to regional innovation in the field of mobility serves as an illustration.",

      "abstract": "Combating complex social issues such as homelessness, gang violence, or child sex trafficking requires complex coordination on a range of levels and interactions. From individuals engaging with other individuals (person-to-person), to multiple organizations interacting with groups of other organizations (network-to-network), the coordination activities occurring at these various levels include both the formal (contracts, policies) and the informal (ad hoc, spontaneous). Some of the outcomes of coordination activity at these varying levels can be policy changes (revision to laws), resource gathering (e.g. food banks), demonstrations or protests, petitions, or the establishment of victim-care and victim-prevention processes. Given the complexity of coordination and the wide-range of interactions occurring at many different levels, breakdowns in coordination are inevitable. However, there are gaps in understanding coordination in networks that are goal-driven, largely informal and seeking to act collectively over an extended period of time (unlike one-time coordination such as flash mobs). To address some of these gaps, I am currently conducting a case study exploration of a network of multiple organizations and individuals that are coordinating to eradicate child sex trafficking from their community.",

In fact it is an important feature of our society that workers encounter the language of other social strata in certain significant contexts, in their place of work, in the media, in their necessary negotiations with bureaucracy. Children encounter a sociolect different from their own in school though that contact is full of social and linguistic ambiguities. But as Edward Thompson (1965) says",

      "title": "The Group and the Organization",
      "abstract": "The social-psychological theories that apply to behavior in small groups also apply to behavior in organizations (certainly in principle), as well as to small networks and large networks, including those devoted to social action or conflict resolution. This is especially true when the persons in the network are connected through computer-video communication. Both groups and networks may be either formal, having roles designated by their organization, or informal, with roles developed to satisfy the needs of the members in cliques or cabals or to facilitate the achievement of organizational goals.The main influence of the organization on the small group is to define the mission of the group. The organization is part of the \"external system\" of the group that includes the society and the environment. In addition to setting the goal for the group, the organization may also have an influence by providing facilities for the task, including the design of the work space and means for electronic communication, or by setting norms for the types of roles that may be played.In terms of functional theory, some groups are bound more by their equipment, such as air crews, some by the product, such as manufacturing groups, and some by the rules of the game, such as sports teams. Some groups are not bound by any existing equipment, product, or rules but have a task to develop new concepts and discover new relationships, such as scientific research teams. Within each type of group a further differentiation can be made according to the amount of integration and role differentiation required.Small groups or informal networks can be the key to increased (or decreased) productivity if they are involved in problem solving or they can develop norms that are counter to those of the organization and decrease productivity. Just as individuals can play different roles in small groups, so small groups can play different roles in organizations. Some of these roles are formal, some informal, and some dramaturgical.Most of the systems for implementing organizational change involve small groups, for example, by introducing \"quality circles\" for workers or \"team building\" for managers.In the 1990s a major concern in the USA dealt with the influence of \"diversity\" in the composition of groups with regard to differences in members' backgrounds in terms of gender, race, age, personality, skills, or other variables. Variance on any of these factors is associated with differences in meaning, resources, integration, and goal-attainment for a group. Members of homogeneous groups may find it easier to get along with each other but diversity in a group may make it easier to solve complex problems.Leadership is a hardy perennial for research on groups, where a charismatic leader whose power rests upon the devotion to the sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character of an individual person is contrasted with a transformational leader who can bring followers to move beyond their self-interest and commit themselves to a higher moral responsibility. Charismatic leaders may affirm group members' identities while transformational leaders may increase commitment.In the same period there was a sudden interest in group support systems that made it possible, using computers or telecommunications, for individuals to make decisions from different geographic locations. Computerized work organizations typically have fewer hierarchical levels, a bifurcated work force, frequently with race and sex segregation, a less formal structure, and diminished use of internal labor markets with reliance instead on external credentialing. The use of group support systems has positive main effects on decision quality, number of ideas generated, and equality of participation, but negative main effects in terms of time to reach a decision, consensus, and satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Although the idea of community opens up possibilities for thinking about agency, sociality and collectivity in the face of austerity, it also has significant limitations. It can reify and ossify collectives in ways that do not align particularly well with complex and fluid social realities. Where ideas of community are adopted popular and political levels, they can result in processes of social purification that demand either assimilation or exclusion. Furthermore, they can lead to moralizing assessments about responsibilities of marginal members of society to engage in ‘good’ community. Finally, they can also limit the scale of social membership and allow those with resources to abdicate responsibility towards those who do not. This commentary notes that the idea of community might be most productively deployed not to understand the resilience of homogenously defined groupings (such as poor/white/British) but rather the ways in which responses to injustice can bring people into redistributional and common cause relationships across demographic and class divides.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social media impacts people’s wellbeing in different ways, but relatively little is known about why this is the case. Here we introduce the construct of “social media sensitivity” to understand how social media and wellbeing associations differ across people and the contexts in which these platforms are used. In a month-long large-scale intensive longitudinal study (total n = 1632; total number of observations = 120,599), we examined for whom and under which circumstances social media was associated with positive and negative changes in social and affective wellbeing. Applying a combination of frequentist and Bayesian multilevel models, we found a small negative average association between social media use AND subsequent wellbeing, but the associations were heterogenous across people. People with psychologically vulnerable dispositions (e.g., those who were depressed, lonely, not satisfied with life) tended to experience heightened negative social media sensitivity in comparison to people who were not psychologically vulnerable. People also experienced heightened negative social media sensitivity when in certain types of places (e.g., in social places, in nature) and while around certain types of people (e.g., around family members, close ties), as compared to using social media in other contexts. Our results suggest that an understanding of the effects of social media on wellbeing should account for the psychological dispositions of social media users, and the physical and social contexts surrounding their use. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of social media sensitivity for scholars, policymakers, and those in the technology industry.",

      "abstract": "Social competence refers to the ability to engage in meaningful interactions with others. It is a crucial skill potentially malleable to interventions. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to select which children, which periods in a child's life, and which underlying skills form optimal targets for interventions. Development of social competence is complex to characterize because (a) it is by nature context- dependent; (b) it is subserved by multiple relevant processes that develop at different times in a child's life; and (c) over the years multiple, possibly conflicting, ways have been coined to index a child's social competence. The current paper elaborates upon a theoretical model of social competence developed by Rose-Krasnor (Rose- Krasnor, 1997; Rose-Krasnor and Denham, 2009), and it makes concrete how underlying skills and the variety of contexts of social interaction are both relevant dimensions of social competence that might change over development. It then illustrates how the cohorts and work packages in the Consortium on Individual Development each provide empirical contributions necessary for testing this model on the development of social competence.",

      "title": "Implicit Culture Framework for behavior transfer: Definition, implementation and applications",
      "abstract": "People belong to different communities: business communities, Web 2.0 communities, religious communities, scientific communities, just to name a few. Everyone can belong to and acquire experience in more than one community. This experience is related to the community activity and comes in the form of best practices, behavior, implicit (tacit) knowledge, ways of using artifacts, etc. All these accumulates and evolves over time and slowly becomes a part of the culture of the community. If community activity is very specific, it can be reflected also in the specificity of the community culture. Newcomers\r\nin such community might suffer from what is called “culture shock”, i.e. a feeling of confusion when not able to grasp what is common for old-timers. This occurs because part of the community culture is not explicit, i.e. not readily available, and it is very hard to extract valuable information from it. Such information can be used for increasing economic and social benefits of the community members (e.g., for performing recurring tasks, easier integration of newcomers, better quality of life). Moreover, the awareness of the community culture could help the community to handle the turnover of members and structural changes, while preserving the culture. All these introduce the need for transfer of culture between or within communities.\r\nCurrently, there is no domain-independent approach for discovering, representing, transferring, and preserving community culture. Moreover, taking into account the amount of information accumulated by communities, computer aided tools for such representation and transfer are of utmost importance. A key property of such tools should be their non-intrusiveness, i.e. they must be as much integrated in the community practices as possible.\r\nResearch challenges in solving these problems include, but are not limited to: 1) providing a generic approach for dealing with community culture; 2) designing a framework and\r\ncomputer aided supporting tools for transferring culture; 3) implementing the framework, applying and evaluating it in different domains.\r\nThis thesis addresses the problem of culture transfer. First, we formalize the notion of culture, which includes behavior, knowledge, artifacts, best practices, etc., and provide a classification of problems that involve culture. Second, using this formalism, we propose the Implicit Culture Framework, which is an agent-based framework for transferring behavior among community members or among communities. Then we describe three applications developed using the IC-Service in the domain of recommendation systems: a system for web search, a system for software pattern selection, and a system for web service discovery. Finally, we present the results of the evaluation of the applications with real users and with ad-hoc user models.",

      "abstract": "In the everyday world people form small conversing groups where social interaction takes place, and much of the social behavior takes place through managing interpersonal space (i.e., proxemics) and group formation, signaling their attentio to others (i.e., through gaze behavior), and expressing certain attitudes, for example, friendliness, by smiling, getting close through increased engagement and intimacy, and welcoming newcomers. Many real-time interactive systems feature virtual anthropomorphic characters in order to simulate conversing groups and add plausibility and believability to the simulated environments. However, only a few have dealt with autonomous behavior generation, and in those cases, the agents’ exhibited behavior should be evaluated by users in terms of appropriateness, believability, and conveyed meaning (e.g., attitudes). In this article we present an integrated intelligent interactive system for generating believable nonverbal behavior exhibited by virtual agents in small simulated group conversations. The produced behavior supports group formation management and the expression of interpersonal attitudes (friendly vs. unfriendly) both among the agents in the group (i.e., in-group attitude) and towards an approaching user in an avatar-based interaction (out-group attitude). A user study investigating the effects of these attitudes on users’ social presence evaluation and proxemics behavior (with their avatar) in a three-dimensional virtual city environment is presented. We divided the study into two trials according to the task assigned to users, that is, joining a conversing group and reaching a target destination behind the group. Results showed that the out-group attitude had a major impact on social presence evaluations in both trials, whereby friendly groups were perceived as more socially rich. The user’s proxemics behavior depended on both out-group and in-group attitudes expressed by the agents. Implications of these results for the design and implementation of similar intelligent interactive systems for the autonomous generation of agents’ multimodal behavior are briefly discussed.",

      "abstract": "Too often people from different walks of life, ideologies and cultures have a hard time working together. Examples include designing a building, playing together on an athletics team, architecting environmental policy or working to hammer out a diplomatic agreement. Communication is essential for people to engage and relate in order to accomplish any of these endeavors. It is humans’ unique ability to communicate that allowed us to work together to birth civilization (Bass, 1974). However, communication can stall and fall apart if people are not on the same page or willing to take into account differing perspectives. Related to this much work has been done on relationship management theory (Ferguson 1984, Ledingham and Brunig 1998, Ledingham 2003, Waters & Bortree 2012, Pratt & Omenugha 2014), but little on how to achieve fundamentally common ground to form relationships.",

      "abstract": "摘要\n 幼兒在幼稚園與同儕互動過程中，不可避免的會發生衝突。個體在衝突情境中的解決策略行為，常能影響同儕間的接受程度。當個體的解決策略不能有效的化解衝突而讓衝突持續發生時，就會影響到人際的互動，進而影響到個體在團體中的社會地位。因此，衝突解決策略對個體的社會互動有其重要性。由訊息處理理論得知，個體選用特定的衝突解決策略是受其目標設定的影響。研究也指出隨著個體年紀漸增，目標設定會因社會經驗的歷練而變得更不易改變。故若能及早發現不同社會地位幼兒在衝突解決目標設定與解決策略使用上的差異，可透過後天教育，幫助他們瞭解及學習較合宜的解決方式。本研究的目的是探討不同社會地位的幼稚園幼兒，在衝突情境中設定目標與選擇策略的差異。\n 研究對象是桃園縣兩所幼稚園大班學生，樣本74人。幼兒的社會地位是以「社會計量地位調查問卷」得之，而幼兒解決衝突所設定的目標與選用的策略則以研究者改編之「幼兒衝突解決目標與策略問卷」測得。結果以單因子多變量變異數分析、重複量數變異數分析等統計方法進行分析。\n研究結果發現，在衝突情境中，受歡迎、被拒絕、受忽略與一般的幼兒不論是在「追求個人興趣」、「依循正確的社會規範」、「保護資源」還是「處置對方」等每一特定目標設定上，均沒有因社會地位不同而有不同。而受歡迎幼兒在四種目標中，較少設定會想讓對方不好過的「處置對方」目標。在衝突解決策略方面，受歡迎、被拒絕、受忽略與一般等不同社會地位幼兒，在「尋求其他資源」、「尋求他人幫助」等積極正向處理衝突的策略，「行動主張」、「肢體攻擊」等積極負向處理衝突策略及消極不直接處理衝突的「離開衝突現場」等每一特定策略選擇上，並沒有因社會地位的不同而有所差異。且研究結果也顯示，在人際衝突情境中，不論所希望達到的目標是為了滿足自我需求的「追求個人興趣」、依循規範的「依循正確的社會規範」、希望避免資源受破壞的「保護資源」，還是想懲罰對方，讓對方不好過的「處置對方」目標，不同社會地位在每一策略選擇上也沒有不同。由於研究結果與預期不符合，推論原因可能是與問卷呈現方式及性別因素有關。\n 由於研究結果顯示，被拒絕幼兒也會使用積極正向的衝突解決策略，故本研究建議，幼兒之教師、家長應對幼兒不當之行為適時提出糾正、並透過各式活動設計教導幼兒習得多元的衝突解決方式，建立尊重他人的觀念，以減少幼兒產生對同儕喜好度不利的負向衝突解決行為。由於除研究方法的採用外，性別因素也會影響社會地位與衝突解決目標、策略的關係，故未來研究應更深入的將各影響因素做探討，以釐清變項間的關係。",

      "title": "Authenticity in creole-speaking contexts: An Introduction",
      "abstract": "A striving for authenticity figures prominently in people’s social behaviour, fulfilling a social-regulative function. Every individual member of a society may be authentic in a minimal sense to the different domains and levels of the collective social system – for instance to the web of cultural meanings (Geertz 1973), in which various forms of cultural learning and mimetic practices effect the conservation of traditional values and norms and make possible the prediction of the behaviour of social agents (Strathern 2004). Authenticity has also been associated with and explained in terms of “the social regulation of [a person’s] emotions” and “a personal ethical ideal” (Salmela and Mayer 2009, 2), which of course makes authenticity something which may be approached but hardly fully attained and/or sustained. Also, being authentic, as an assumed condition of autonomy, implies that a person can only be authentic, or autonomous if they “act for reasons that are truly [ their ] own ” (Betzler 2009, 51). Linguistically, the quest for authenticity expresses itself in discourse at all levels of formality and mediated indirectness, i.e. in what has been referred to as the discursive construction of authenticity and inauthenticity (Coupland 2001). Context, as an “interactively constituted mode of praxis” (Duranti and Goodwin 1992, 9), may be linguistic, social, cultural or stylistic in nature and plays an important part in producing or failing to produce authenticity. Different situational frameworks of linguistic authenticity may be distinguished, e.g. the traditional, local and supposedly “natural” environment of spontaneous face-to-face interaction, but also non-territorial spaces such as media platforms provided by local radio or online chat forums, to name but a few. As will be appreciated, the wide conception of linguistic authenticity which we are advocating here goes against both widespread folk notions of genuine dialect and the traditional consensus in variationist sociolinguistics, which both hold that the geographical or social context in which languages (or varieties) originated is where the most authentic speakers are to be found. In that respect, vernacular or basilectal Creole speakers – speakers whose speech is furthest removed from the standard form of a language – would therefore stand as the best representatives of linguistic authenticity. From the viewpoint of classic variationism, authenticity would tend to correlate with",

Although constructivism originally focused on individual differences in interpersonal competence, it has been applied to numerous communication events and behaviors. It has served as the foundation for theoretical and empirical analyses of relationship development and maintenance, cultural influences on communication, language acquisition and communicative development, socialization processes, and communication instruction. It has also been applied to numerous communication events and processes in business, families, education, health‐care, mass media, and politics (for reviews, see Delia 1987; Applegate 1990; Gastil 1995; Coopman 1997; Burleson &amp; Caplan 1998; Burleson 2007).",

Researchers are paying more and more attention to social innovation beside the classical Schumpeterian approach. Social innovation is new solutions (product, technology, organizational solution) that can effectively meet market needs that are not or hardly met on a market basis, innovation can lead to new or more advanced skills / relationships, and contribute to a more efficient use of resources. However, there is no uniform definition of the concept. The issue of social innovation is particularly important in the case of the Northern Hungary region, because it can bring hope for some peripheral areas and a new approach to solving problems. High technological innovation potential and performance do not necessarily go hand in hand with high social innovation activity, so in the case of peripheral regions there is a hope for social innovations even in the absence of technological innovations.",

      "abstract": "It cannot be said that social contradictions, in general, are harmful or useless. Social contradictions often have dual functions: on the one hand, they exert a degree of negativity on society. But on the other hand, they may become a driving force for social change. During this transition period of reform and development, the latter becomes especially clear. The positive effects of social contradictions are shown by the continuous promotion and improvement of social justice (where the aggravation and escalation of social contradictions create an important opportunity for new patterns of interests), the development and perfection of various systems, the revelation of fault lines or points of struggle in a society's operation, and, under certain conditions, the revelation of where social contradictions have created accumulated discontent or resentments. Social contradictions need to exist in certain conditions to become driving forces for social development. The parties concerned in social contradictions, especially the most influential parties, cannot become irrational, and the majority must have a relatively broad consensus on future prospects. The timing, also, must be right to launch relevant policies.",

There is no single social language for government in action nor for society in action; there are just lots of social languages, some older and some newer, lots of bits and pieces of soft and hard technologies.

Many aspects are very difficult to understand before going into the field. Sometimes, a researcher's previous experience about a particular community may help to gain field access, but it may be difficult to assess the field in advance due to rapid changes within people's livelihoods and other shifts in the community. The change of a political paradigm sometimes seems also to be a challenge at the field level. We believe that although technological innovation has benefited some aspects of the data collection of fieldwork in social research, many other dimensions (mentioned above) of fieldwork endure unchanged.",

      "abstract": "Relationships are held together by social bonds, but the construction of bonds varies from relationship to relationship. Social bonds can have many qualities; they can be strong enough to last a long time or flexible enough to adapt to different conditions and environments. The same individual is usually bound by several social bonds. Social bonds are personal, and people are treated differently, depending on their social bonds. A temporary interaction between people does not require social bonds, but for repeated interaction, people need a means of keeping in touch. There are at least five elements that help link people together in their relationships: 1) They know who is included, 2) they have common ideas about what the relationship involves and what they are expected to do, 3) they have the means of acquiring knowledge about the extent to which others do what they are expected to do, 4) they have some possibility of influencing each other in a way that makes them fulfil the expectations, and 5) they have common ideas about who can take initiatives and who can act in order to maintain and develop the relationship. Social bonds in organizations are constructed through decisions on membership, rules, monitoring, sanctions, and hierarchy. Other types of relationships use other ways of constructing bonds. They can be based on institutions, such as norms, or they can be formed through reciprocity. Many social bonds are designed as combinations of organization, institution, and reciprocity. If a rock band, for example, contains only one or two organizational elements, we can say that it is partially organized.",

A three-week daily diary study (N =178) explored psychological need satisfaction in two key everyday contexts: solitude and social. Holding constant the benefits of need-satisfying social contexts, autonomy satisfaction during solitude was key to peaceful affect, whereas competence satisfaction during solitude contributed to lower loneliness; both psychological needs in solitude contributed to evaluating the day as more satisfying. Relatedness-deficiency in solitude did not contribute to loneliness; instead, those who were relatedness-deficient in social interactions felt lonely. Further, solitude need satisfaction compensated for deficient needs in social contexts, reducing loneliness (autonomy and relatedness) and increasing day satisfaction (all needs) when social contexts failed to satisfy needs. Findings suggest daily solitude can shape daily well-being and further attention is needed to understand and ultimately improve everyday solitude.",

Sometimes, the expectations of the agents in the problemsituation fulfill the fundamental role of achieving coordination. But successful coordination may need not only institutions, customs, or beliefs, but also technology, in some appropriate combination.

In general, one can distinguish several uses of the word: (i) its broader sense in Mater et Magistra; (2) a limited, economic sense used by French writers to signify the way in which property and the firm are no longer isolated but are interdependent; (3) it can be used in a positive sense as implying something morally desirable, the idea of an institution being made responsible to society so that it fulfils a task of service to the community; (4) it can be used in a variety of different ways connected with public ownership; (5) it can be used in an unfavourable sense particularly by Americans e.g. ‘socialization of agriculture’, used as another term for collectivization, or ‘socialized medicine’; (6) in sociology the term ‘socialization’ describes the way in which a child acquires habits and is ‘conditioned’ through its upbringing. The suggestion that John XXIII in this section of the encyclical has in some way approved the welfare state should be dismissed (whether paragraph 136 gives any approval of the idea of the welfare state is a different matter). The section on socialization (paras 59 to 67) immediately follows the section on subsidiary function in which the Pope has emphasized the importance of a man’s right to be primarily responsible for his own upkeep and that of his family (para 55). The section on socialization makes no direct reference to industry so that socialization in the public ownership sense of the term is not intended.",

      "title": "Narratives of linguistic victimhood and majority groups’ acculturation strategies and multilingual attitudes: The mediating role of intergroup empathy",
      "abstract": "Language is a crucial element of the acculturation process. In immigration-receiving societies, studying the linguistic acculturation of majority groups is socially and theoretically relevant. In bilingual contexts where co-official languages have a history of conflict, the narrative of linguistic victimhood may play an important role in predicting responses to linguistically diverse immigrants. In two correlational studies in historically linguistically oppressed societies, specifically in the Basque Country (N = 589) and Catalonia (N = 526), using representative samples, we explored the relationship between a society's narratives of inclusive linguistic victimhood, encompassing both general perceptions (i.e., perceived similarities between in-groups' and out-groups' experiences of linguistic victimization) and context-specific perceptions (i.e., perceived similarity between the linguistic victimhood of the host society group and of immigrant linguistic minorities), and majority group attitudes towards linguistic acculturation (i.e., willingness to learn the languages of immigrant groups or to maintain the majority group language) and multilingual policies. Additionally, we examined the mediating role of intergroup empathy in these associations. The results indicated that, while general inclusive victimhood narratives were associated with native language preservation, context-specific narratives were linked to stronger willingness to learn immigrants' languages and supporting multilingual policies. Empathy played a mediating role between general inclusive victimhood and the willingness to acquire immigrant group languages, as well as in the relationship with attitudes towards multilingual policies. The theoretical and practical implications of these victimization narratives for acculturation processes and structural changes in the host society are also discussed.",

To this problem of emergent novelty the social forecaster must add the difficulties which arise because: (1) the social systems are much more complex than the aspects studied by the separate social sciences and (2) the sharing of parts between different subsystems is so great that their subordination to newly emerging processes can be very difficult to detect. At least three strategies have evolved to cope with these difficulties. Two have proven of limited value. All fall short of the kind of methodology which can be identified as necessary.",

Language that excludes certain groups of people denies their full participation in a community; in learning environments, this denial entrenches inequality and causes marginalization (Annamalai & Skutnabb-Kangas, 2020). Some identities may become invisible, such as that of nonbinary and gender nonconforming individuals, who face binary expectations of behavior and self-presentation (Paechter et al., 2021).

      "abstract": "An organization exists in the context of other entities (such as other organizations and governmental, political and social entities) in its organizational environments. The organization’s focal entities become its task environments that require its immediate attention and it has to interact with all such entities so that it is able to satisfy their expectations from it, and, in turn, by pursuing its strategy, it achieves its own goals. This is the model that describes the situation of any organization, including a multinational corporation (MNC) in its international and multi-cultural setting. Often, the negotiation process for meeting an organization’s needs may involve managing inherent conflict, disagreement or competing for constrained resources, thus making negotiation an arduous process. The very basis of give-and-take interactions and negotiations across different cultures, that typify an MNC in its multi-cultural setting, becomes the foundation for cross cultural negotiations. Such negotiations provide the MNC the method of communicating with its diverse entities and seek the services from them for it to achieve its goals. Because an MNC operates in an international and multi-cultural setting, its many entities are of diverse nature and cross cultural communication and negotiation skills become the critical. The inter-organizational interactions of an MNC in its international and multicultural setting become the basis of its day-to-day operations.",

Yet narratives often tell stories about specific individuals rather than the broader collectives these problems affect. Some theorists argue that individualizing collective problems inhibits audiences from recognizing upstream causes and solutions. This study tested how narrative individualization (whether a story focuses on an individual case or a larger collective) might produce trade-offs when mobilizing support for community-level policies to address childhood obesity. We also investigated whether narratives using language congruent with political partisans’ morals (equity or loyalty) might minimize polarized responses to such narratives. A large, Web-based experiment with a national sample of U.S. adults demonstrated that both individual and collective narratives increased policy support relative to a no-message control group. Individual narratives promoted policy support via narrative engagement, tender emotions, and external thoughts about the issue. Against expectations, morally congruent narratives did not outperform morally incongruent ones.",

      "abstract": "Nonverbal communication as being a fundamental aspect of communication, meaning “nonverbal symbolic codes applied in relations in daily life”, is used mostly unconsciously but continuously. It is revealed in the researches that 38% of communication is comprised of audio codes, %55 body language and 7% words. As can be seen, importance of nonverbal communication is undeniable. General opinion in society is that nonverbal communication is comprised of just gestures and mimics. But voice, word accent, silence, colors, body posture and angle, touching, smell, use of objects, sense of place and time, dressing, accessories used, walking style etc. are included in nonverbal communication. As can be seen, nonverbal communication covers items which are non-verbal and cannot be expressed with words. In addition to rhetoric, when a community is evaluating political leaders they resorts to some other information. This information is usually obtained from nonverbal communication. Voters in the society and other national societies take into account when communicating face to face with politicians the tone of voice, rhetoric, dominance of the mother tongue language, as well as the dress style, jewelry, accessories, body posture, gestures and facial expressions as non-verbal communication and persuasion factors. In the presentations and international relation conferences the non-verbal elements, as stated before, are much more effective, easier to recall, cogent and persuasive than elements of written communication of the political leaders messages. “How are the non-verbal communication items used by political leaders” is the starting point and the question for this article. Because today nonverbal communication items are effective to create political image and has an important dimension in the international politics. In this article, these items are reviewed with examples in communication literature. Key words: Nonverbal communication; Politics; Political leader Resume La communication non verbale comme etant un aspect fondamental de la communication, qui signifie «non verbale codes symboliques appliquee dans les relations dans la vie quotidienne, est utilise plus souvent inconsciemment mais continuellement. Il est revele dans les recherches que 38% de la communication est compose de codes audio, le langage corporel de 55% et les mots de 7%. Comme on peut le voir, l'importance de la communication non verbale est indeniable. L'opinion generale dans la societe, c'est que la communication non verbale est composee de gestes et mimiques simplement. Mais la voix, l'accent parole, le silence, les couleurs, la posture du corps et de l'angle, le toucher, l'odorat, l'utilisation d'objets, le sens du lieu et de temps, l'habillage, les accessoires utilises, la marche de style etc sont inclus dans la communication non verbale. Comme on peut le constater, la communication non verbale couvre les elements qui sont non-verbale et ne peut pas etre exprime avec des mots. En plus de la rhetorique, quand une communaute est d'evaluer les dirigeants politiques qu'ils recourt a certaines autres informations. Cette information est generalement obtenu a partir de la communication non verbale. Les electeurs de la societe et d'autres societes nationales de prendre en compte lors de la communication face a face avec les politiciens du ton de la voix, la rhetorique, la dominance de la langue maternelle, ainsi que le style vestimentaire, des bijoux, des accessoires, la posture, les gestes et les expressions faciales que la communication non verbale et les facteurs de la persuasion. Dans les presentations et les conferences internationales concernant les elements non-verbaux, comme indique precedemment, sont beaucoup plus efficaces, plus faciles a rappeler, forte et persuasive que les elements de la communication ecrite des messages des dirigeants politiques. «Comment sont les elements de communication non-verbale utilisee par les dirigeants politiques » est le point de depart et la question de cet article. Parce que les elements de communication non verbale sont aujourd'hui efficaces pour creer l'image politique et a une dimension importante dans la politique internationale.

      "title": "SHAPING THE PUBLIC IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE: SOCIAL FIELD ANALYSIS FUZZY SET METHOD",
      "abstract": "Communication is key to social interaction and people’s socialisation. The interaction between people and institutions is based on strategic communication as a vital component for the survival of society. This strategic communication is used by agent-communicators on behalf of formal organisations, and intended for their target public. Moreover, every strategic communication is affected by invisible social forces (institutions, networks, cognitive frames), which ‘manage’ the process of communication with the public. We use the SOFIA approach to provide an analytical model of influence of the social forces during the shaping of the public. The aim is to combine theoretical and practical approaches of Communication and Social Field Theory. Further, using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), the causal complexity of these relationships is examined, taking account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for particular outcomes to occur. Institutions and networks are necessary conditions, yet neither meets the criteria for sufficiency. However, the absence of these conditions does not necessarily indicate the absence of communication. Exploring the combinations of necessary conditions for communication reveals complexities such as the interaction between institutions, networks and cognitive frames. The absence of certain social forces, together with the presence of other forces, emerges as a relevant condition for communication. Accordingly, the fact that institutions in the social field exist is not all that is important, but also that they communicate and create networks of interactions for the public’s better understanding. The strategic communication framework, navigated by the invisible social forces, actually improves the ability to shape the public in the desired direction. Keywords: social institutions, social networks, cognitive frames, fuzzy set analysis.",

      "abstract": "In a changing world, change management processes become physiological, for individuals, social groups, or organizations. However, what are the basic characteristics of the change? What are the effects of these characteristics? What are the cognitive limits that impede the perception of change? When the change is perceived and interpreted, how will the organization deal with the change process? This study seeks to answer these questions by referring to organizations more so than to individuals. Three fundamental characteristics of current change will be identified, for simplicity's sake called: 1) acceleration, 2) interdependence, and 3) the prevalence of the symbol. For each of these, the consequences for awareness of and adjustments to the change will be presented. The more complex the change is, the more necessary it is to have models to perceive and interpret it. Unfortunately, there are a number of cognitive limits that impede an understanding of the change, the most evident of which are: a) the lack of systemic thinking, b) the inability to perceive sudden changes, c) the inability to observe changes which are too slow, and d) the tendency toward one-way observation. Faced with the complexity of change, which is increasingly viewed as an equilibrium-impeding disturbance, the ability of organizations and social systems to survive for a long period of time depends on the ability to produce a countervailing change of the vital processes in order to achieve new equilibrium states. From this perspective, three forms of change in organizations will be considered that involve: 1) operational programmes; 2) organizational structures; and 3) culture, and cognitive, and behavioural models. A model is proposed that integrates these three forms and highlights their motor wheels.",

      "abstract": "Se sabe que no existe total neutralidad cientifica en el estudio de los hechos sociales, asi como en los ambitos y metodos de investigacion predominantes hasta ahora en el tratamiento de las problematicas de interes. Muchas veces se deja de lado el hecho de que el conocimiento y las metodologias para acceder a el son productos culturales cuya practica incrementa los valores que dan cohesion a una sociedad. Despojarnos de las armaduras y seguridades que nos brinda lo conocido y abordar caminos mas cercanos al reconocimiento y las caracteristicas de los contextos, posibilita un compromiso real con la transformacion social. En esta situacion, los grupos de investigacion se enfrentan a exigencias cada vez mas complejas, y se ven abocados a reorientar sus metodos y tecnicas tradicionales a la solucion de problemas de la realidad social, los cuales no permiten ser afrontados con resultados aislados, con fragmentos de explicacion, pues solo por medio de la suma de esfuerzos complementarios y de explicaciones integradas, se responde pertinente y eficazmente a su comprension.\nCotidianamente, la investigacion cualitativa (IC) es planteada por los programas academicos que reconocen el caracter social de sus saberes y la diversidad de formas de entender y conocer las realidades que configuran lo humano. No obstante, su implementacion ha generado tambien la proliferacion de sentidos y tendencias, que van desde posturas que abogan por la complementariedad de los metodos cualitativos y cuantitativos, con el argumento de que cada uno trata aspectos diferentes de la misma realidad (1), hasta propuestas criticas en franca oposicion a los modelos positivistas tradicionales, que argumentan el distanciamiento de estos de los contextos y rostros de los agentes sociales, y que el investigador debe hacer de la investigacion una opcion para el desarrollo equitativo de la sociedad, asumiendo un criterio integral en la aproximacion a las problematicas.\nEsta variedad de argumentos ha imposibilitado la existencia de una unica definicion de investigacion cualitativa (2). Sin embargo, se han encontrado elementos comunes a ella que permiten encuentros relacionados con su objeto de estudio, su proposito como ciencia y sus estrategias metodologicas (3). No existe una unica forma de investigacion cualitativa, sino multiples enfoques cuyas diferencias fundamentales vienen marcadas por las opciones que se tomen en cada uno de los niveles: ontologico, epistemologico, metodologico y tecnico (4). Pese a esto, los metodos denominados cualitativos presentan algunos aspectos comunes que los diferencian de la investigacion tradicional. Entre ellos, el enfasis en el mantenimiento de su estatus de ciencia social, especificamente en el estudio de fenomenos de tipo social y cultural (5); fenomenos que frente a los cambios globales, nacionales y regionales, demandan de las universidades respuestas con pertinencia y responsabilidad social. Para ello, la investigacion cualitativa, como proceso de apropiacion de la realidad y articulacion del conocimiento, permite, ademas de la comprension de los fenomenos y problematicas sociales, la fundamentacion de acciones institucionales, interinstitucionales, disciplinares e interdisciplinares que mediante el trabajo conjunto propugnen el mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida en una region o pais.",

      "abstract": "In nowadays Ukrainian society, there are pretty many events at the intersection of conflict situations that require understanding, dialogue, and platforms to build connections between members of different social communities. One of the ecological ways of building dialogue is social theater.Each theater is inherently social, but we talk about free theatrical format aimed at public dialogue. In general, public dialogue is a dialogue between classes and social groups to reconcile their interests in the distribution of economic, political and cultural resources. In a specific definition, it is also the process of proclamation and converging positions so that to reach an understanding and making common decisions across different social groups.Modern forms of the social theater include playback (narrative theater), forum theater (oppressed, invisible, etc.), educational theater (medicine, pedagogy), therapeutic theater, theater in the proposed circumstances (prison theatre, Theatre of War Productions), performances (museum theater, improvisation). Mostly they are spontaneously organized by “amateur” theaters, which are founded by activists and enthusiasts. Their focus is on the dramatic events of individuals who represent invisible groups that have specific social problems.Thus, the general functions of the social theater can be divided into communicative, consolidating, cognitive, therapeutic, adaptive, rehabilitative, and creative.Judith Ackroyd talks about the dual purpose of social theater to promote changes in public opinion and behavior as well to encourage the public to the partnership. That is why it is hard to overestimate the role of social theater to get unity, cooperation, and activity.",

Social movements are sustained collective actions occurring outside legitimated institutions of social power in pursuit of social goals (→ Collective Action and Communication).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Large language models (LLM) have been a catalyst for the public interest in artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies perform some knowledge-based tasks better and faster than human beings. However, whether AIs can correctly assess social situations and devise socially appropriate behavior, is still unclear. We conducted an established Situational Judgment Test (SJT) with five different chatbots and compared their results with responses of human participants ( N = 276). Claude, Copilot and you.com’s smart assistant performed significantly better than humans in proposing suitable behaviors in social situations. Moreover, their effectiveness rating of different behavior options aligned well with expert ratings. These results indicate that LLMs are capable of producing adept social judgments. While this constitutes an important requirement for the use as virtual social assistants, challenges and risks are still associated with their wide-spread use in social contexts.",

It also assesses the intersecting influence of societal hierarchies on youth's understanding of economic inequality and the socioemotional and behavioral correlates of their discernment of structural arrangements that produce inequality and marginalization. These advances in knowledge raise several interesting issues, among them (a) when during the life course explanations of poverty and distributive justice reasoning crystallize; (b) whether distinct developmental trajectories exist in these domains; (c) whether early patterns of moral emotions, reasoning, and decision-making shape interactions with less economically advantaged peers and predict subsequent attitudes and behavior pertaining to social justice issues; (d) the role of educational experiences and parental socialization in youth's understanding of structural causes for group inequalities; and (e) whether and why structural thinking about inequalities may be domain-specific (e.g., race, social class, income, gender).

      "title": "Social relations and institutional structures in modern American political campaigns",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Sato, Ingrid Li | Advisor(s): Raymond, Geoffrey | Abstract: The art of rhetoric (Aristotle) is the art of persuasion: using forms of talk to gather people together - to forge agreement and thereby stimulate [positive] action. How one gets others to agree (with them) - and act on that agreement - is of prominent concern for politicians and those aiming to influence social policy, and is inevitably done through interaction. The campaign speeches during the US Presidential Election Campaign of 2008 have attracted the attention of a wide range of scholars in Sociology, Political Science, and Communication studies. Although Atkinson (1984), Heritage and Greatbatch (1986), Clayman (1993), and others have radically transformed our understanding of the devices speechmakers use to coordinate audience response (clap trap), to date no social or political scientist has described how these moments are stitched together, in real time, to organize the speeches - presidential or otherwise; and we know little about the differences between alternative forms of collective appreciation (e.g., applause versus chanting), and what this might tell us about the different social relations that speakers can establish with audience members by varying specific components of their speech. As a consequence, we understand very little about how politicians compose specific political messages, or how these are shaped by the changing [media] landscape of modern political campaigns. This research tackles these issues directly by developing a detailed analysis of campaign rally speeches as well as the audience's responses using the tools of Conversation Analysis. Through a descriptive and analytic account of the underlying normative organization of campaign speeches and the contingencies facing both speakers and audience members, this research considers how speakers use these occasions to shape - even transform - the opportunities and bases for public participation in the political process; demonstrating how the distinctive turn-taking system and its relationship to the institutional occasion (c.f., Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, 1974; Atkinson and Drew, 1979; Atkinson, 1982; Heritage 1984; Heritage and Greatbatch, 1991; Drew and Heritage, 1992; ) - and the forms of political expression they enable - are consequential for the social relations built through them. In this respect, this research offers a novel approach to a basic question posed by politicians and social/political scientists: What sort of social relations do political leaders establish with the constituents they serve? And how are modern campaign events used to establish such relations? Specifically, an account of the orderliness, structure, and sequential patterns of talk-in-interaction reveals the ways candidates exploit the interactive organization of speech giving in different ways: how different rhetorical forms were used to make relevant different forms of collective appreciation by audience members (e.g., applause versus chants), which allowed candidates to establish different relations with the public (e.g., did the audience agree with the speaker, or did the speaker agree with the audience?); which building blocks used over the course of a speech (and the entire campaign) could be used to mobilize audience members' participation in events beyond the campaign event, and which caused others' speeches to be more inert? This research offers the most complex (and complete) understanding of modern campaign speeches to date, as well as compelling new findings to help understand why some speeches campaigns are more successful than others.",

      "abstract": "The social construction of mental illness is strongly influenced by the media and by our everyday opportunities to tackle with it. Many representations of experience a similar outcome through different media formats: news, talk shows, a few special programs or documentary films, but also by the important though underestimated role of the indirect information in fiction dramas, movies, TV series. Moreover today we are faced with a process of disease mongering concerning also mental illness; therefore we experience new social definitions of some mental troubles (i.e. depression) having ambivalent outcomes in the social legitimation of madness. The Italian context presents also a distinctive aspect: the disappearance of the psychiatric asylums has made mental patients more socially visible and present in the everyday urban places. However this change moving toward new social encounter opportunities has not yet reduced the fear of the occult involvement (following the Goffman's words), that appears as a threat to the order of our social interaction. How can we tackle a mad person if we are not sure whether she/he share or not our ordinary frame of interaction? Usually, we think that only the expert is charged with the responsibility of the socially occulted behaviour. Is there one clear border that we can socially experience among different degrees of mental illness? Have we new social instruments to understand it as a treatable disease? The paper discusses this constructivist perspective presenting a reflection on media and other social actors, to understand which social paths can we identify in the process building, reinforcing or - vice versa - weakening the core representations of the stigmatising process of social dangerousness of madness.",

Pero, las practicas encaminadas a la intervencion nunca estuvieron cercanas al desarrollo de las ciencias teoreticas, como la Sociologia aplicada, que muchos autores entienden como empirica en el sentido de la investigacion sociologica, de dificil proyeccion en el campo de la accion social (Gomez, 2016). Aunque debemos senalar que ultimamente la propuesta de la Socioterapia, como intervencion socioterapeutica, que puede ser considerada proxima a la denominada Sociologia Clinica esta surgiendo como alternativa al escaso desarrollo profesional de los sociologos, de forma masiva en el mercado laboral. La Sociologia con su gran desarrollo academico no ha entrado a proponer o a buscar metodos o tecnicas de intervencion social como practicas que posibiliten unos cambios relacionales entre los miembros de la sociedad, que les lleven a unas relaciones mas satisfactorias entre ellos. \r\n\r\nSin embargo, este tipo de cambios si se han desarrollado en practicas terapeuticas proximas a la Psicologia Social, en la que se puede encuadrar la denominada Sociologia Clinica.\r\nUna corriente proxima a dicho enfoque clinico fue la que se desarrollo como metodo de grupo operativo, de la Escuela Argentina de Psicologia Social creada por Enrique Pichon Reviere y por el interaccionismo simbolico de George Herbert Mead y que fue defendido abiertamente por algunos profesionales de lo social, que poco a poco han tenido la certeza de lo necesario de unas teorias y unas practicas en concordancia con las necesidades de los miembros de cada sociedad. este articulo refiere algunas aportaciones importantes para la comprension fenomenologioca y existencial del sujeto, que nos servira ademas como aproximacion a los autores considerados, ya que los mismos vivieron inmersos en una cultura propia de sus respectivas obras y acciones profesionales e intelectuales, que ademas de su pertenencia a ambitos intelectuales diferentes: Jasper al pensamiento Aleman y Rogers al pensamiento Americano.",

Social image concerns and other-regarding preferences interact to create incentives to communicate about how one feels about other people.

We investigated this phenomenon using different types of economic games (i.e., social dilemmas as well as coordination games). Our studies broadly cover three themes: (a) fairness as a coordination rule, (b) uncertainty and common understanding, (c) social information as a cue. By focusing on these themes we have obtained several new insights on the prerequisites and boundary conditions of tacit coordination. We conclude that tacit coordination is often facilitated by mutual adherence to social norms (e.g., fairness rules, rules of deference, etcetera), but that in order to employ such norms people need sufficient environmental and/or social information.",

In its use as a social activity, language imbues the world with meaning, and in turn derives meaning, through interplay among language, thought and experience (Landauer and Dumais p211; Cruse p125). How people come to conceptualise complex words and ideas depends on different cultures and languages of use (including public, workplace and scientific subcultures and terminologies). As an added factor, certain expressions function as 'buzzwords' or 'catchphrases' to invoke an emotive reaction (Little 929). Whereas emotive language works for general communication, situations requiring precise meanings for shared terminologies might result in the dismissal of mistreated terms as poorly defined and inconsequential (Callicott, Crowder and Mumford p23; Hull et al. p11).",

The purpose of the research, the results of which presented in this article is to analyze the problems of formation of civil society at the regional level. The basic criterion for the condition of civil society is the public opinion. Therefore, the research is based on the public surveys, carried out by the Institute of Socio-Economic Development of Territories of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The study has showed that the civil society in the Vologda region is in the period of formation. Its main problems are: 1) social (lack of interpersonal confidence, absence of responsibility for what is happening outside the family, disbelief in the possibility of influencing the processes in the country, region, place of residence, the low level of social activity and credibility of non-profit organizations population, etc.); 2) legal (imperfect legal system);3) organizational and economic (weak resource base of non-profit sector). At the same time, the development of civil society has a potential. For its realization, there are two directions: 1) to establish the mechanisms of interaction of the state and non-profit organizations (expanding the list of organizations having a right to receive state support, simplification of non-profit organizations reporting, expansion of its competence, etc.); 2) to stimulate direct public demand for the activities of non-profit organizations.",

Provine y Fischer (1989) exponen que la risa es mucho m?s dependiente del ambiente social que la sonrisa o el habla; los sujetos reian un promedio de treinta veces m?s en inte racciones sociales que cuando estaban solos, en comparaci?n con las seis veces que sonreian y las cuatro veces que ha blaban. Jefferson (1985: 34) demuestra que la risa es un ?recurso interactivo, co mo una actividad sistemica que justifica y recompensa m?s que la menci?n de su ocurrencia?. Sin embargo, los histo riadores orales suelen transcribir la ri sa limit?ndose a hacer constar que se pro duce.

      "title": "Cooperation and social organization depend on weighing private and public reputations",
      "abstract": "Abstract To avoid exploitation by defectors, people can use past experiences with others when deciding to cooperate or not (‘private information’). Alternatively, people can derive others’ reputation from ‘public’ information provided by individuals within the social network. However, public information may be aligned or misaligned with one’s own private experiences and different individuals, such as ‘friends’ and ‘enemies’, may have different opinions about the reputation of others. Using evolutionary agent-based simulations, we examine how cooperation and social organization is shaped when agents (1) prioritize private or public information about others’ reputation, and (2) integrate others’ opinions using a friend-focused or a friend-and-enemy focused heuristic (relying on reputation information from only friends or also enemies, respectively). When agents prioritize public information and rely on friend-and-enemy heuristics, we observe polarization cycles marked by high cooperation, invasion by defectors, and subsequent population fragmentation. Prioritizing private information diminishes polarization and defector invasions, but also results in limited cooperation. Only when using friend-focused heuristics and following past experiences or the recommendation of friends create prosperous and stable populations based on cooperation. These results show how combining one’s own experiences and the opinions of friends can lead to stable and large-scale cooperation and highlight the important role of following the advice of friends in the evolution of group cooperation.",

      "title": "Social Influence in Social Contexts",
      "abstract": "The book has covered, so far, historical, sociocultural, and psychological perspectives of strategic social influence processes and research primarily on manipulative behavior covering interpersonal, social, and organizational contexts. To recapitulate the central ideas, the basic premise of social influence suggests that individuals change their behavior to adjust to their social environment, attitudes, thinking, and action. Social influence processes use new information and social norms to impact the target. A credible source of information is valued and considered trustworthy with high acceptance. When individuals do not know what to do, they look to their peers for advice and model. It is common for people to imitate an expert friend for correct action. In the case of normative social influence, individuals change their attitudes and behaviors to meet the social standard, just to fit in society. The best examples are conformity to peers' views due to social pressure (see Chap. 3 ). However, an individual or a small minority may not conform and instead assert independence, and at times minority consistent insistence may impact the majority. This chapter discusses the nature and practices of social influence and issues beyond the individual level. Democratic institutions grant people more openness and opportunities for influencing and winning people in socially normative ways. However, in autocratic social systems, power inequality prevails, so the powerless show submission and surrender, and the powerful indulge in authoritarian control and coercion. In the competitive world, social, political, and business leaders adopt dynamic ways from persuasion to pressure to influence and control the targeted population to make them act in a manner that serves their vested interest. The chapter presents salient features of social influence phenomena at the group level.",

      "abstract": "Normative conduct is a major component of systems of culture. Each culture has its specific norms for everyday social interaction. Differences in norms and cultural expectations often become grounds for intercultural miscommunication and misunderstanding (→ Cultural Patterns and Communication; Nonverbal Communication and Culture). There are innumerable definitions of norms in the social science literature. For example, norms are defined as “rules of conduct,” “blueprints for behavior,” and “cultural expectations.” Comparing existing definitions, Gibbs (1965) finds three attributes of a norm: “(1) a collective evaluation of behavior in terms of what ought to be; (2) a collective expectation as to what behavior will be; and (3) particular reactions to behavior including attempts to apply sanctions or otherwise induce a particular kind of behavior” (→ Intercultural Norms; Social Norms).",

In a culture, characterized by strong helping norms, money cues reduced the quality of help given (Experiment 1), and lowered perceived moral obligation to help (Experiment 2). In communal relationships, money reminders decreased willingness to help romantic partners (Experiment 3). This effect was attenuated among people high on communal strength, although money cues made them upset with help requests (Experiment 4). Thus, the harmful effects of money on prosocial responses appear robust.",

Unemployment officially and open refers to direct exclusion from the labor market, but there is also a phenomenon of exclusion inside the labor market. Some groups are involved in segments where jobs are uncertain, poorly paid and do not require special or specialized training. Labor market segmentation tends to be built around immediately identifiable groups (eg by age, ethnicity, gender), so that the exclusion of the \"decency\" is doubled, associated with other forms of social exclusion.

Responding to incentives of family, work, money etc. revealed the types of speech action in the situation of a free and directed associative experiment. The actualization of meanings in the process of responding to value-significant stimuli established the uniformity of cognitive mechanisms, the absence of complexity in the cognitive structure of associative fields, the prevalence of semantic areas representing socially and personally significant intangible objects - family, love, morality, ethics, a person that should be stored, developed, transmit. Most of the cases of directed association are associated with the unambiguous nature of the response, clear boundaries of the stereotype area, a low level of emotion and evaluation, the frequency of complex reactions (series of enumerations, for example, values - security, comfort, stability, family, one’s job, country). The concentration of stereotypical meanings (the area of frequency reactions of the core of associative fields) is higher when responding to stimuli What kind of work …, Work requires what …, What kind of family …. The remaining stimuli cause an approximate equality of stereotyped and individual ways of responding. The life experience of the respondents had a significant impact on the choice of the type of speech action and the method of response.",

      "abstract": "Comparison of the various ways in which people talk in different sociocultural and linguistic communities can easily lead to two, apparently contradictory, conclusions. On the one hand, the diversity of conduct is striking. People speak different languages, they are oriented to markedly different sociocultural norms of posture and tone, they inhabit very different social (as well as economic, political, etc.) worlds and thus find occasion to talk in vastly different “contexts.” One need only compare, for instance, the Mayan villagers of Tenejapa with Yélî Dnye speaking Rossel Islanders to see this diversity (as Rossano, Brown and Levinson do in this volume). On the other hand, the commonalities are what are remarkable. Everywhere turns-at-talk are constructed and opportunities to speak distributed, courses of action are launched and co-ordinatively managed, troubles of speaking, hearing and understanding are located and their repair attempted. These commonalities suggest that, for all the diversity we see, people everywhere encounter the same sorts of organizational problems and make use of the same basic abilities in their solutions to them – a capacity for reading other's intentions, anticipating and projecting actions, calculating inferences and processing information available to them (see Levinson 2006, Schegloff 2006).",

Il loro comportamento rispetta il modello di politeness del “Social Contract of Values” (Mursy &amp; Wilson, 2001) stipulato tra gli individui e la società, per cui il complimento risponde alla Massima di Generosità sancita dalle norme sociali: ad un’offerta di cibo si risponde con un complimento, e al complimento con una nuova offerta di cibo. I complimenti non vengono mai rifiutati, ma in qualche caso li si deve ignorare, quando toccano degli argomenti tabù come i bambini piccoli o il cibo in preparazione, su cui potrebbero gettare malocchio. Fare complimenti su questi topic è una mancanza di rispetto, e una violazione del Social Contract of Values, per cui nessuna azione rimediale è possibile sul piano conversazionale.",

      "title": "Модели языковой политики в мультикультурализме",
      "abstract": "Today, most states at least in some casemay be characterized as culturally diverse. International dialogue of scientists and artists, qualified migration and student mobility leads to the situation where in most countries significant numbers of people belong to different cultures. The problem of multiculturalism arises precisely from the fact that many people want to stay in the country they came in. So, in this connection the question arises: to what extent the cultural diversity can consideras acceptable and tolerable and how to ensure harmony in these circumstances? When within a single society coexist people with different cultural traditions, it is necessary to solve a number of problems, to provide and arrange all the rules of social life and to determine the range of rights and responsibilities of individuals and communities. Because to solve these issues is not easy, cultural diversity often leads to conflicts, including lin-guisticconflicts.The language conflict as a social conflict, one way or another related to the language policy, may have the underlying causes in economic, political, socialand religious fields. However, it is taking shape in connection with the problematic linguistic situation, when a socially dominant group tries to limit the social (economic, cultural, and so on) possibilities of other groups,and, in the case of language conflict, will beregarded as a language group. Sometimes the causes of the language conflict can be concentrated specifically in the area of language, so the language policy of the dominant community becomes a point of social discontent from which grows the conflict. Given that, the majority of people havea well-established views on what is right and wrong, good and bad, fair and no, definition of the theoretical foundations of the language policy in a situation of multiculturalism is equivalent to answering the question: whether there is a set of general principles that can serve as a reference to solve language problems, and what kind ofnorms should be guided by a society where different cultures coexist? In this paper defends the thesis that the best answer to this question is given -is the language policy based on the principle of liberal neutrality, which is understood in the context of the theory of classical liberalism, developed by classical liberal authors and its interpretation in terms of the theory of multiculturalism C. Kukathasand views of A. Patten.",

However justified this is for some research questions, it is not justified when the interaction itself is in the focus of interest. Large‐scale social events, processes and institutions require analysis for their psychologically relevant attributes. Three major difficulties in conducting such studies are discussed here: (1) there are no codified methods for the analysis of the social side of the interaction; (2) the varying speeds of historical change demand a distinction, which is difficult to make, between relatively more and relatively less enduring features of a social situation; (3) the role of theory in such research differs from that in mainstream social psychology.",

Critical reflection is a resource for responding to multifaceted and conflicting dimensions as a fundamental precondition for wonder and potentially for fostering social change beyond current conditions and practices. Only if we challenge and attempt to transform perceptions, can social change be possible. Critical reflection calls into question the power relations that promote implicit or explicit rules. Questioning normative knowledge in a given context may seem difficult in the struggle for reducing social problems, but it is precisely in this embeddedness of issues there is a need for reflection on the very criteria of social conditions. This implies a reflection on the manner of how forms of knowledge provide certain conceptualisations of human life, society, social problems and welfare, and the struggles embedded within them.",

      "title": "Человек в поисках идентичности: проблема социальных критериев",
      "abstract": "According to the data of surveys, it is not only so that man in the present Russian society is not emancipating from the state's guardianship but on the contrary, needs it more dramatically than before. A solution of this apparent paradox is to be found in distinguishing between different social meanings of appeal to the state community. It seems possible to find sociological parameters in a plurality of indicators through definition of specific functions of variable indicators, and in connection with them of their various levels and meanings. It seems justifiable to distinguish between the types of social (or socially meaningful) psychological identification. The first one integrates society, the second one ensures the integration of person, creating a certain balance of tensions and relaxation. Integrative may be viewed as definition of the situation of a person, action or an institution in the three-dimensional socio-cultural space. The role of axes in such a is performed by submission (normative vertical line), interaction (horizontal line of social exchange), tradition (link of epochs, generations; historical depth). In the hierarchy of meaningful values it comes out that the first places are occupied by time-related (generation-related) links between children and parents, further there are value-normative, institutionalised and symbolic positions (the man, representative of mankind), etc., and the purely group affiliation seems the least important. The today's readiness of a good one-third of the population to claim their with the Soviet citizenship cannot be explained by only inertia of outdated symbols that have lost their subject or merely demonstration of opposition against the political regime. Adherence to the model of self-justification is to different extents found among various age groups and even at the opposite poles of the political range. The spread of ethnically marked phobias creates a real, though mainly passive and disperse, potential of international alienation. But not at any rate a potential of intranational solidarity. Negative identification related to the aliens can consolidate the people in those cases when it reaches the level of fear for own existence. In the present Russian society there are no generally accepted criteria of evaluating human actions. Unconditionally, pragmatic, utilitarian, i.e., particularistic values dominate. A moral identity of society is absent. At the same time, the ideas that, according to respondents' opinion, could consolidate society, have a negative content (denial of disorder, instability). It confirms the unreality of restoration of an ideological Soviet-type society.",

      "abstract": "Masalah sosial merupakan satu fenomena yang tidak dapat dielakkan daripada berlaku dalam masyarakat hari ini. Setiap hari kita dapat melihat di kaca televisyen dan suratkhabar pendedahan mengenai pelbagai kegiatan jenayah yang berlaku dalam masyarakat. Masalah jenayah dan salah laku yang berlaku dalam masyarakat menarik perhatian awam dan menjadi bahan perbahasan politik semasa. Orang awam berada dalam keadaan khuatir dan gelisah terhadap bahaya dan kesan salah laku sosial dalam masyarakat serba moden yang mengutamakan individualisme dan materialisme dalam kehidupan mereka. Masalah sosial mempunyai pengertian yang luas, is bukan hanya mencakup permasalahan kemasyarakatan tetapi juga yang mencakupi permasalahan dalam masyarakat yang berkaitan dengan gejala-gejala abnormal dalam kehidupan masyarakat. Masalah adalah sesuatu yang memerlukan penyelesaian, perkara atau keadaan yang menimbulkan kesukaran atau kesulitan. Sosial pula adalah segala yang berkaitan dengan masyarakat. Oleh itu, masalah sosial boleh diklasifikasikan sebagai sesuatu yang memerlukan penyelesaian bagi keadaan yang menimbulkan kesulitan kepada sesebuah masyarakat. Masalah sosial sering dikaitkan dengan keadan tertentu seperti kemiskinan, kebuluran, jenayah dan fenomena sosiobudaya yang menghalang masyarakat daripada mengecapi potensi maksima mereka (Eitzen,1984) dan ketidakseimbangan dalam masyarakat sehingga unit tersebut mengklasifikasikan individu sebagai devian (Becker, 1967). Tingkah laku devian merujuk kepada aktiviti yang mengambil tempat dalam masyarakat serta tindakan atau perbuatan melanggar norma-norma yang wujud dalam masyarakat, komuniti dan organisasi bagi tempoh tertentu. Unsur sosiobudaya biasanya mempengaruhi tingkah laku devian. Tingkah laku devian adalah sesuatu yang arbitari dan wujud kerana proses labelling yang mengambil tempat dalam masyarakat pada hari ini. Proses labelling ini dilakukan dengan giat oleh unit masyarakat yang mempunyai kuasa (kerajaan tempatan, kerajaan negeri, atau mana- mana badan berkanun) kerana mereka berusaha dengan giatnya untuk mencapai `UTOPIA' (keadaan masyarakat yang ideal dan sempuma) dalam perjuangan mereka. (Eitzin dan Zinn, 2000)\r\nBerdasarkan penjelasan di atas, masalah sosial dapatlah ditafsirkan sebagai keadaan yang tidak digemari oleh orang ramai dan perlu dibasmi, diselesai atau diperbaiki melalui tindakan bersama oleh anggota-anggota masyarakat (Julian, 1996; Tallman dan McGee, 1971; Abd. Hadi, 2004). Oleh itu masalah sosial dilihat mempunyai dua unsur utama iaitu tingkah laku yang menentang atau menyimpang dan norma-norma masyarakat. Kepincangan institusi keluarga menjadi asas kepada wujudnya masalah sosial. Perubahan tingkah laku individu dalam keluarga memerlukan campur tangan daripada masyarakat agar masyarakat dapat meneruskan fungsinya. Untuk itu, perlu ada usaha bagi memelihara dan mengembangkan keberfungsian sosial sesuatu masyarakat kerana masalah sosial melibatkan aspek yang berkait dengan individu dan sosial dalam masyarakat.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The custodial function of people changing organizations is usually latent; as against the socialization/therapy dominating in the outward presentation and consciousness of the members, it only comes into being in borderline cases. Sociological analysis of the establishment of schools and psychiatrical clinics shows however that even from the beginning the development of these organizations only made „progress“, if the socialization was linked with custodial interests - e.g. due to increasing social differentiation or political crises. Also today certain tendencies in the development of the educational system reveal the relevance of the custodial function, although it is partly overlapped by other factors. Contrary to the widespread belief that socialization and custodial functions can be fulfilled simultaneously both functions can only be combined on a marginal basis, because similar implications do have different meanings. Irrespective of numerous endeavours within the people changing organizations to interpret social processes in consistency with the socializing function, the efficiency of the socialization can be completely ruined immediately, should the custodial function become obvious. A less rigid definition of the identity standards could relieve the people changing organizations of custodial demands.",

In light of these issues, paper tries to make contribution to practical opportunities of radical social work in 21st century. What is that social workers can actually do to make significant contributions to social change? Paper presents four areas of activities which can contribute to social change: demonstrative, cooperative, formative and transformative with practical examples from Croatian perspective. Demonstrative activities have aim to raise public conscious on certain issue, resource distribution and structural factors that affect social problem. ‘Public’ includes professional community, service users, politicians and population in general. These activities range from providing information to transfer social ideas through campaigns, cooperation with media and producing pressure in public sphere. Cooperative activities are to develop partnership in public space through finding partners, establish formal alliances, networking and associating. Possibilities can range up to political pressure (which happens through social movements and pressure groups). Formative activities encompass transfer of specific knowledge and experiences about radical approach to social work students. Stronger binding of social work education with the „real life“ of social work clients may open platform for their future social activism that is not necessarily associated with the prevailing „evidence based epistemology“ in social sciences. Transformative activities are directed to producing social change in narrow sense: providing new services or initiating changes through political processes. These aims can be achieved either by interfering in legislative processes or through direct political decision making by citizens. In all of these activities social workers can be seen as initiating and coordinating force that can develop sustainable platform for further social activism.",

Is it necessary to make references to work when naming a profession? Maybe such notions of recent past as party work, party worker or trade union worker accounted for the negative attitude towards the said word combinations. Almost 10 years passed, and the concepts, such as social work or social worker became common. They no longer jar on nobody’s ears. However the following questions are still topical: What is social work? What do social workers do? Is it science or art? The majority of sciences have developed from philosophy. They have scientific names, usually of Latin or Greek origin. The beginning of social work is associated with charity or philanthropic activities.",

A coordination problem is a situation in which each person wants to participate in a group action but only if others also participate. The relevant group action in social-role-mediated exchanges of information puts conditions on the flow and use of information. It is easy to solve such coordination problems when it is common knowledge that parties will all conform to the conditions. People’s presentation of themselves in social roles create such common knowledge that they will conform to standards of thought and behavior associated with those roles. We offer six examples of how common knowledge solves the coordination problems that typify social role interaction.",

Bu uygulama, işyerleri, eğitim kurumları ve siyasi ortamlar dahil olmak üzere çeşitli bağlamlarda ortaya çıkabilir ve kurumsal kültür, çalışan morali ve yönetişim için önemli etkilere yol açabilir. Kurumsal ortamlarda, kayırmacılık genellikle çalışanlar için eşitsiz fırsatlarla sonuçlanır; belirli kişiler, yöneticiler veya yönetim tarafından tutulan kişisel ilişkiler veya önyargılar nedeniyle terfi, proje atamaları veya tanınma gibi avantajlar elde eder. Bu, göz ardı edildiğini veya değersiz görüldüğünü hissedenler arasında kızgınlık ve kopukluğu teşvik ederek toksik bir çalışma ortamı yaratabilir. Kayırmacılık, nepotizm ve kronizm gibi diğer ayrıcalıklı muamele biçimleriyle de kesişebilir. Nepotizm, aile üyelerine ayrıcalıklı muamele anlamına gelirken, kronizm arkadaşları veya ortakları kayırmayı içerir. Her iki uygulama da kişisel ilişkiler liyakate dayalı değerlendirmelerden önce geldiği için çıkar çatışmalarına ve yolsuzluğa yol açabilir. Bu uygulamaların etkileri bireysel deneyimlerin ötesine geçerek kuruluşların ve siyasi sistemlerin genel işleyişini etkiler. Bu bağlamda son yıllarda kayırmacılık örgütler için özellikle istihdamda çok konuşulan bir kavram haline gelmiştir. Buradan hareketle çalışmanın amacı, kayırmacılık kavramını tanımlayarak örgütlerde kayırmacılık uygulamalarını, türlerini, kayırmacılığın nedenlerini ve sonuçlarını, kayırmacılığı etkileyen faktörleri ortaya koymaktır.",

Law is an aggregate of general social norms of conduct, differing from other such aggregates in the following ways: the legal norms express the interests and strivings of the class which controls the society, i.e. the ruling class in all the states with class exploitation, and the working class and its allies in socialist states, in the first phase of their development. The discovery that minions of the law are less severe than the average population when essential norms of interaction are broken, and more severe in the case of trespassing against formal and procedural regulations, is significant.",

They provide complex understandings that allow for ambiguities in identity creation. Findings: A personal and social self interacting create identity, emerging from social relations. Professional identity thus emerges from the interaction between personal identity and collective professional identities. Ascription of social and professional identities by powerful social groups is resisted, but identities emerge in identity politics among professional groups in social situations. In a client-worker-agency interaction cycle, multiprofessional interactions in communities of practice lead individual professionals to negotiate knowledge to form specialized roles such as palliative care social work. These then influence wider professional identities. Applications: Rather than seeking to maintain established professional identities, workers may more effectively develop their professional identity by negotiating knowledge and demonstrating practice in multiprofessional teams.",

      "abstract": "Performance practice since the 1990s has been characterised by an increased interest in theatre that either operates without professional performers or minimises their involvement. Instead, those performing have included a diverse array of specialists in areas of expertise other than that of performance-making. Often referred to as ‘experts’, they have frequently been selected according to their life experiences and/or connection with particular social categories such as economic class, field of work, ethnicity, age, and (dis)ability (Bishop 2012: 219). 1 The concept of the ‘expert’ and the many theatre practices and discourses connected with it often challenge the professional / non-professional opposition. For example, while experts may not fulfil the criteria of people who are regularly engaged in the paid occupation of acting or performing, they do share with such professionals an ability to demonstrate special skills, training, and/or knowledge, often including advanced skills in performing a version of one’s self. We are aware that our use here of the term ‘non-professional’ could reinstate the type of binary troubled by the word ‘expert’. Nevertheless, we find the term useful as a way of referring to those figures, in works and events created by professional artists, who are not extensively trained in acting or performing and who usually do not earn their living from appearing on the stage.",

      "title": "New basics, new curriculum: making old schools 'new'",
      "abstract": "[Extract] Schools are complex places. They are grand social institutions, situated in local places, the site of complex cultural struggles. In the schoolyard and in the classroom, individuals seek to find their identity mediating the images, messages and knowledges about their world. Simultaneously, issues of 'complex connectivity' (Tomlinson, 1999), the rapidly moving networks of 'interdependencies that characterise modern social life' (p. 4), place economic, political and environmental pressures from local, state, national and global realms, on schools. Pressures that are valued are welcomed and desirable, and enter through the front door. Devalued cultural entities, commonly misunderstood and considered devious by teachers and parents, arrive by jumping the fences, hitchhiking in backpacks, or as illegal downloads, and remain marginalised by the dominant authority but are often fiercely guarded within youth cultures being played out in the school yard and classrooms. Other sets of values may be forced upon a school and become included in the school's rhetoric, but excluded in the practice of the social rituals performed by the school community in school culture. Some of the significant choices schools make in their response to globalisation are the issues I examine in this paper. Is it morally correct or educationally valid that some schools fail to mediate complex connectivity? Is trying to insulate their structures, policies, curriculum and students from the impact of globalisation ethically and morally more destructive to local cultural and economic communities left to battle the impacts on their own? Or do schools open their doors, engage in multidimensional flows and attempt to make sense of fluid, irregular shapes … that characterise international capital as deeply as they do international clothing styles (Appadurai, 1996, p 7). Process analysis of marginalisation issues that emerge at the interfaces between global forces and local cultures reveals boundary judgements and effected consequences on the community or systems within those boundary perimeters. For the purposes of this paper, I have chosen to analyse two schools currently operating within the New Basics (NB) Queensland Middle School Renewal Trial. NB, I argue, is the embodiment of global, national, state and local connectivities, and therefore, a curriculum model designed for students and teachers to mediate the complexities of globalisation. The implementation of NB in the two schools shows how schools respond to globalization at the level of curriculum and pedagogical reform. One school has embraced the trial, providing leadership, resourcing and ideology to facilitate rapid and massive change, while the other has adopted a minimalist approach to implementation in an attempt to avoid and shelter the school from its full impact. This paper's analysis concludes by considering the consequences of each school's reaction and responses to the NB in the context of uncertain political realities in the future, and makes predictions of the schools' situated preparedness in the event of differing political outcomes.",

      "abstract": "More and more people are temporarily or permanently moving to another country, for study, work, or as a refugee. Adjustment to the new cultural environment is not always smooth. Recent research suggests that in addition to the social context, personality dimensions influence how effectively individuals adjust to a new culture. In his thesis, Joachim Wohrle investigated the role of attachment security in explaining whether people succeed in intercultural adjustment. Attachment security can best be understood as the degree to which individuals are able to trust others and themselves; it is learned early in life, through the interaction with caregivers such as the parents. In accordance with theory and previous research, the results of this thesis show that a high degree of attachment security is beneficial for psychological-, and especially social adjustment. The findings indicate that immigrants and international students with high levels of attachment security are better able to deal with stressful experiences, are more successful in mobilizing and maintaining social support and have more social trust. Moreover, it appears that attachment security is, at least in certain contexts, a better predictor of adjustment than other personality traits (such as intercultural traits), and that it can help to prevent stressors (such as financial distress, unfair treatment) or mitigate (distrust in political institutions) their influence.",

      "abstract": "The manner in which people communicate influences the nature of the interpersonal relationships that they are able to establish. Although the processes involved in establishing interpersonal relationships and in developing communication skills are lifelong, these processes are particularly important in adolescence.\nDuring adolescence, teenagers are not only expected to expand the number and variety of their social contacts, but to negotiate a change in the nature of the contacts as well. Relationships with parents and peers, for example, must alter if the adolescent is to succeed in accomplishing the developmental tasks of this age group (Duvall, 1971).",

      "abstract": "Since the late 1980s, in the political discourses of several European countries the term ‘poverty’ has been gradually substituted primarily by the term ‘social exclusion’ and, to a lesser extent, by the terms ‘social disintegration’ and ‘social marginalisation’. Comprehensive definitions of ‘social exclusion’ used in the academic literature interpret it as the denial of social, political and civil rights of citizens in society or the inability of groups of individuals to participate in the basic political, economic and social functionings of the society [Silver (1994), de Haan (1998)]. In practice, though, policy makers as well as a number of social scientists in EU member-states seem to interpret ‘social exclusion’ as ‘exclusion from the labour market’, ‘acute poverty and material deprivation’ (or both) or, less frequently, ‘inability to exercise basic social rights’ [Mayes et al. (2001), Atkinson et al.(2002)]. Few empirical studies investigating aspects of social exclusion can be found in the literature and, among them, there exists little agreement regarding its proper operationalisation.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of transdisciplinarity has been a response to the often-failed closed-system, discipline-based approaches to solving complex social problems (various reports and definitions may be found in projects reported by the OECD, UNESCO and EU). These failures are often contingent upon disaggregated notions of epistemology and the compounding failures of ontological incongruities that are evident in these discipline-based approaches. Such approaches are not necessarily confined to large, seemingly insurmountable social problems, but apply equally well to issues in educational institutions as workplaces. Transdisciplinary knowledge is in the liberation of new and imaginative understanding of the structured reality of open social systems. It gives rise to generative mechanisms, which are central to relationships of agency and structure.",

      "title": "Overcoming Defensiveness in Response to DEI-Related Challenging Feedback",
      "abstract": "Management research often emphasizes the importance of how people speak up (e.g., in terms of content and delivery) to help ensure that information or perspectives being offered are received well by others. However, less attention has been paid to the importance of recipient preparedness for receiving challenging feedback, and how organizations can equip leadersmanagers to better receive such input. This may be especially important to consider within the context of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Members of non-dominant social groups (whether along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class or otherwise) may have better insight into ways that existing organizational practices, structures and systems detract from equity and inclusion goals because of their own experiences and the experiences of their communities. However, they are often put in the position where sharing this insight requires speaking to dominant group members in higher positions who may see such feedback as a threat on multiple levels (e.g., moral identity, managerial competence, expert identity). This may be true even if the feedback recipient holds positive diversity beliefs and egalitarian ideals. Defensiveness of gatekeepers in response to such feedback can impede organizational efforts to achieve equity and inclusion. And, putting the onus on employees from non-dominant groups to manage how their feedback is received,when they may be suffering or exhausted from going unheard in the past, is problematic. In this panel symposia, scholars who investigate responses to voice/feedback and the psychology of dominant groups, will come together to discuss: a) why research on recipient-driven psychological barriers to benefiting from challenging feedback is important for achieving organizational equity & inclusion goals, b) how we can build upon existing work across management sub-fields to investigate the factors that influence how dominant group members respond to challenging DEI-related feedback, and c) how these insights can inform evidenced-based approaches for organizations to prepare leaders from dominant groups to better receive such feedback.",

      "abstract": "Community-centered collaboration is an important backbone in current language documentation and conservation activities (Yamada 2007; Penfield et al. 2008; Dwyer 2010). Reasons for taking this approach include: (1) documentation efforts can be made sensitive to actual needs/wishes of the community and thus more responsible and ethical; (2) bringing in different views, ideas, and expertise makes documentation richer, thus more rewarding. \n\nHowever, since socio-political situations in language communities vary widely in different parts of the world, there are cases where the collaborative documentation model cannot easily be applied. Ikema, a dialect of Miyako, an endangered Ryukyuan language in Japan, is a good example. Specifically, we have experienced difficulty in getting a sense of what the community wants for their own language. Two issues involved here are:\n\na) Although speakers are generally aware of the decline of their traditional language, they do not have a clear sense of or are not particularly interested in examining its current state, nor do they know what they want to do for their language. \nb) People in the community vary in their attitude toward the traditional language so much that it is rather difficult to identify the needs of the “community” as a whole. \n\nThere are many factors at work in creating this situation, but two are most notable and obviously related:\na) lack of a strong desire to establish their identity separate from mainstream Japanese society;\nb) a lack of desire to establish that the traditional language constitutes a separate (structurally and culturally independent) system \n\nThis situation is hardly unique among Ryukyuan languages, nor does it seem unusual elsewhere in the world (Ladefoged 1992).\n\nIf we were to accept that we may not always be able to identify the needs and desires of the community, how can we be sensitive to them? Should we “educate” the community about language endangerment issues and foster “their” desire to care about their own language? Does the community want that? Do we know what represents “community needs”? Who is the “community”? How do we “listen to the community” when the community doesn’t appear to have a consensus about what they would like?\n\nThere are not simple answers to these questions, but we feel that they are important questions that require explicit attention and discussion. We hope this presentation will create an opportunity for exchanging ideas and exploring possibilities concerning how we want to proceed from here on.",

      "abstract": "Work is a fundamental constituent of the social and political agenda of modern societies, and the emphasis placed on having employment and performing well in one's job is filtered by family and community values. A job has typically been considered a key factor in one's socio-economic standing. By contrast, people who are not employed and sustain themselves on welfare benefits often face societal contempt. This is regardless of the reason that led to their ‘dependency’ and of their own responsibility (or lack thereof) for the situation. The ambiguous nexus between disability and labour is usually attributed to disabled citizens’ limited working capacity arising from their physical, cognitive, or mental impairments. By placing the issue of labour centre stage and undertaking in-depth case studies, the chapters in this volume have illuminated the degrees to which disabled citizens’ limited role in the labour market owes to society's and employers’ attitudinal limitations, be they environmental barriers, inadequate rehabilitation and training facilities, or prejudices. Moreover, they have highlighted that there will always be disabled citizens who are not able to enter the (competitive) workforce at all. They face extra challenges not only because of their status (typically on the poverty line), but also because of the stigma attached to the ‘idleness’ of those who are not considered to be actively contributing to society.",

      "title": "Is social exclusion still important for older people",
      "abstract": "The concept of social exclusion builds on the longstanding recognition of the relationship between material and non-material forms of disadvantage. Theoretically, the concept of social exclusion describes a detachment between the values and practices of the socially excluded and mainstream society, in part through the exclusionary practices of the socially included. While social exclusion for younger adults and children may revolve around the labour market, educational achievement and future potential, for older people the notion of social exclusion is grounded more in the preservation of independence and autonomy. Socially excluded older people are often those who are regarded as having lost their independence. Older people may be at risk of social exclusion because of (based on Philipson and Scharf, 2004): (i) age-related characteristics that are more likely to occur in later life, such as disability, low income and widowhood; (ii) cumulative disadvantage, where cohorts become more unequal over time due to, for instance, the impact of labour market experiences on pension outcomes; (iii) community characteristics (and the interaction with age and cohort characteristics) which make older people more vulnerable to changing conditions like population turnover, economic decline and crime, in their local areas; (iv) experience of age-based discrimination. In this report, we examine the concept of social exclusion among older people using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We adopt both a cross-sectional and longitudinal approach to analysing data collected in 2002 and 2008, building on earlier seminal work exploring social exclusion among older people by Barnes et al (2006). We recognise social exclusion as a multifaceted state, involving both material and non-material factors, and measure exclusion from the following domains: 1. Social Relationships; 2. Cultural Activities; 3. Civic Activities and Access to Information; 4. Local Amenities; 5. Decent Housing and Public Transport; 6. Common Consumer Goods; 7. Financial Products. We find that levels of social exclusion rose slightly between 2002 and 2008 among older people aged 50 and above. In 2002, 54.4 per cent were not excluded on any domain, reducing to 52.3 per cent in 2008. Between 2002 and 2008, becoming excluded from social relationships, civic activities and access to information, cultural activities, and local amenities was associated with a lower quality of life score; becoming excluded from social relationships and decent housing and public transport was associated with becoming lonelier between sweeps, while becoming excluded from social relationships was additionally associated with worsening self-perceived financial circumstances. These results suggest that the impact of being socially excluded influences outcomes reflecting both material and non-material circumstances.",

The subject of the monograph ('Social and identity mobility in the Slovenian territory between the late Middle Ages and the 20th Century') are phenomena and processes accompanying or (co)constituting long-term social movements. The definition “social and identity mobility” roughly encompasses three basic elements: 1) social mobility of individuals, communities, and groups over shorter and longer periods of time; 2) changes in their identity that are directly or indirectly related to social mobility, and 3) mobility of collective identities determinable over longer periods of time. All three elements listed above are also included in the so-called confessional mobility (changes in confessional affiliation), which has its own unique characteristics, and is often closely related to social or identity mobility and to the question of confessional identity as such.",

The resulting discomfort and frustration can prompt withdrawal or avoidance of social situations, which, in turn, can severely limit the range of activities available to older adults and lead to a less active and satisfying lifestyle, and, in some cases, depression. Using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health’s (ICF) multifactorial model (WHO, 2001), we review the wider aspects of functioning and disability as they relate to hearing difficulties and communication, placing a particular emphasis on the work we, an international and interdisciplinary group of researchers, have done in the context of the ERA-NET funded interdisciplinary HEARATTN project. The ICF model is particularly fitting because it allows us to consider how physiological changes in hearing and cognition affect listening in various situations, what the consequences of these changes are for communicative abilities and social participation, and how this in turn affects life-space mobility, self-reported well-being, and, ultimately, quality of life. We will discuss how environmental conditions (both physical and social) and personal factors can affect how well older adults can communicate in the situations characteristic of everyday life. In the concluding section we discuss some behaviours, techniques and strategies that can be adopted to maintain or improve effective communication under difficult listening conditions.",

      "abstract": "The systems approach in social work emerges as a key methodology that enables a holistic understanding of complex social phenomena, the interrelations between elements of the social environment, and the needs of vulnerable population groups. In the context of armed conflict and post-war recovery, its significance increases as these processes trigger profound structural changes in society, destabilize traditional forms of support, and complicate access to resources and social services. The essence of the systems approach lies in viewing the client of social work not in isolation, but as part of a complex interactive system (family, community, institutions, social context), while the social work system itself is understood as a set of interrelated structural elements (goals, tasks, principles, subjects and objects of social work, environment – both internal and external – and conditions of interaction, technologies of social work defined by specific forms and methods, means, and outcomes). It facilitates the development of comprehensive support programs tailored to the real conditions and needs of specific social groups: internally displaced persons, veterans, individuals with traumatic experiences, orphans, persons with disabilities, etc. In the post-war period, the systems approach supports the coordination of cross-sectoral interaction – between government bodies, local communities, and international partners. It assists in developing strategies for the restoration of social capital, the reproduction of life resources, and the creation of conditions for the integration and reintegration of affected individuals. The methodology of the systems approach provides not only solutions to urgent challenges but also contributes to the formation of sustainable models of social functioning in the long-term perspective.",

      "title": "Beyond six feet: The collective behavior of social distancing",
      "abstract": "In a severe epidemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing can be a vital tool to stop the spread of the disease and save lives. However, social distancing may induce profound negative social or economic impacts as well. How to optimize social distancing is a serious social, political, as well as public health issue yet to be resolved. This work investigates social distancing with a focus on how every individual reacts to an epidemic, what role he/she plays in social distancing, and how every individual’s decision contributes to the action of the population and vice versa. Social distancing is thus modeled as a population game, where every individual makes decision on how to participate in a set of social activities, some with higher frequencies while others lower or completely avoided, to minimize his/her social contacts with least possible social or economic costs. An optimal distancing strategy is then obtained when the game reaches an equilibrium. The game is simulated with various realistic restraints including (i) when the population is distributed over a social network, and the decision of each individual is made through the interactions with his/her social neighbors; (ii) when the individuals in different social groups such as children vs. adults or the vaccinated vs. unprotected have different distancing preferences; (iii) when leadership plays a role in decision making, with a certain number of leaders making decisions while the rest of the population just follow. The simulation results show how the distancing game is played out in each of these scenarios, reveal the conflicting yet cooperative nature of social distancing, and shed lights on a self-organizing, bottom-up perspective of distancing practices.",

      "title": "“It’s More than Just Needing money”: The Value of Supporting Networks of Care",
      "abstract": "It is well established in research, practice, and policy that unpaid caregivers (family and friends of people with care needs) experience stress in their role. Supports that have been put in place by policy planners and program developers to support caregivers may not be accessed by caregivers at all or may do little to reduce their stress. Accessing personal resources (education, finances), in addition to social resources (individual connections) and societal resources (community supports) are critical in fostering resilience in caregivers (helping them adapt to stress and adversity). Social capital theorists argue that creating connections at various levels can improve access to resources. This research, through qualitative interviews (n = 21), identifies the different levels of resources required to address the needs of caregivers. Our findings indicate that interventions that focus on access to personal-level resources (education, funding) are important, but are on their own insufficient. Of more importance were interventions that work to improve relationships between formal providers and families; access to interdisciplinary teams; cross-sectoral collaborations; and inter-organization relationships, highlighting that a system that works together is likely to improve caregivers’ access to resources.",

      "abstract": "Whereas in one-mode data, individuals or groups are connected directly with one another through interactions or relations, in two-mode data, individuals are indirectly connected with one another through affiliations (events, organizations, associations, alliances, and so on). Affiliation data are often used as a proxy for detecting ties among social actors when direct evidence of ties is difficult to obtain. For example, it is generally easier to know that two people belong to the same club or work in the same department than to know that they have lunch together every Thursday. But affiliation data can also be used to see aspects of social structures not visible in one-mode networks. Duality is a kind of structural relation that shows how levels of social structure intersect with one another. We discuss the classic approach to duality as well as two generalizations that extend the duality approach in hierarchical, temporal, and spatial directions.",

      "abstract": "The term negotiation is more and more frequently used nowadays not only in trade or business activities, but also in many other fields of activity. People negotiate in all areas of social life (in the family, at work, in the street, in shops, in a company, in a political party, between states, etc.) whenever they seek to resolve differences of opinion or to get what they want. Any kind of negotiation starts from a series of basic conditions (the interdependence of the parties engaged in negotiations, the existence of some differences of opinion, the parties’ joint work to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement). At the same time, any negotiation takes place in a certain setting, bordered by the object of negotiation, its aims and stakes, the place and time of its deployment. Depending on the areas where the process of negotiation appears, one can speak of three general types: the economic negotiation, the political negotiation and the social one. At this level, other classifications can be identified, according to the participants in the negotiations, the parties' interests, the negotiating environment, the time and duration of negotiations and the manner of completion, all in the limits of two extreme poles, the conflict and the cooperation between the parties involved. Keywords: negotiation, participants, conflict, cooperation, communication.",

      "abstract": "Various problems arise in almost every country. These crises, which have a wide-ranging influence on society; irregularities in income distribution, terrorism, activities of criminal organizations, intolerance of various segments of society, abuse at the state level, restriction of liberties, epidemic diseases, natural disasters. Each crisis causes different results in society. Social problems can cause people to act in search of ways to benefit from this situation to maintain the existing standard of living since it affects living conditions. Also, they may give illegal reactions to protect themselves against social security problems that may arise. Perception, approach, problems arising from attitudes, and perplexing relationships are formed between public expectations, and public policies created by the management during times of crisis. For managers who have a voice in a country's administration to make the right decisions and implement them, they should know the characteristics of their society, their needs, expectations, and what their problems are.",

      "title": "Introduction to the Economics of Giving, Altruism and Reciprocity",
      "abstract": "Altruism, giving and pro-social conduct, and reciprocity, are the basis of the existence and performance of societies, through their various occurrences: in families; among the diverse motives of the political and public sector; as the general respect and moral conduct which permit life in society and exchanges; for remedying failures of markets and organizations (which they sometimes also create); and in charity and specific organizations. Altruism has various origins: it can be hedonistic or natural altruism in empathy, affection, sympathy, emotional contagion, pity, and compassion; or normative altruism of the moral, non-moral social, and rational types. Giving can be altruistic, aimed at producing some social effect in the fields of social sentiments, situations or relations, an intrinsic norm, or self-interested. Reciprocity, in which a gift elicits another gift, is a pervasive social relation due to either a desire of balance (and possibly fairness), or to liking a benevolent giver (moreover, self-interested sequential exchanges look like it). Joint giving for alleviating poverty and need makes giving a contribution to a pure public good for which efficient public transfers crowd out private gifts. Yet, private giving can be an intrinsic norm or a demand of reason, or it can be motivated by the non-moral concern about judgments of others or of oneself. Families - the institutions for love and giving - are networks of reciprocities. Intertemporal giving includes gifts to future generation through bequests, and to earlier generations through the relevant public indebtedness (retro-gifts). Normative opinions about societies, and in particular about justice, imply and require altruism and constitute a form of it. Moreover, altruism is the mark of good social relations and good persons. Altruism and giving have always been analysed by economics, notably by all great economists, with an upsurge of studies in the last third of the 20th century.",

      "title": "The Relevance of Popularity",
      "abstract": "Under conditions where the exchange of information is largely unrestricted, one measure of a story or genre's popularity is its pervasiveness, which may be assessed cross-culturally (e.g., how widespread the story is across societies) or intra-culturally (e.g., the percentage of group members who know the story). This definition embraces a host of motivations for telling or listening to a story (e.g., instruction, manipulation, curiosity, entertainment), many of which are subsumed by the criterion of relevance: when people have an interest in telling and/or listening to a given story, we may say that the story has relevance for them. Story relevance is likely rooted in local ecology: stories that address problems the audience may experience in real life may be expected to attract widespread interest because the information they contain is potentially useful. Conversely, stories that do not address such problems may attract less interest because they have no practical application. This essay develops the hypothesis that relevance affects story pervasiveness by examining two popular story genres from two very different socio-economic systems: the transformer tale and the bedtime story. The former is widespread across forager groups but absent in modern industrialized societies, while the latter is widespread across modern societies but glaringly absent from forager oral tradition. The principle of relevance would predict that each story addresses a problem that is specific to the ecology in which it is current. As we will see, this is the case: the problem addressed by the transformer is absent from modern industrialized societies, and the problem addressed by the bedtime story is absent from forager societies.",

For example, connective comparisons (e.g., perceiving shared attitudes) strengthen communal motives, whereas contrastive comparisons (e.g., perceiving incompatible attitudes) dampen them. Likewise, upward assimilation and downward contrast comparisons strengthen agentic motives, whereas upward contrast and downward assimilation dampen them. People also advance their agentic and communal goals by making comparisons selectively (e.g., noticing similarities with people they want to connect with) or selectively making themselves the targets of others’ downward, upward, or connective comparisons by advertising their weaknesses, strengths, or similarities. Finally, while some situations (e.g., competition) stimulate agentic motives and vertical comparisons and others (e.g., cooperation) stimulate communal motives and horizontal comparisons, many situations (e.g., ongoing partnerships) stimulate complex combinations of agentic and communal motives and comparisons.",

      "abstract": "What one says to compatriots in face-to-face conversations is often misunderstood; imagine the possibilities for misunderstanding with someone halfway around the world living in a very different culture and whose native language is not the one both of you are speaking! Clear communication is fundamental for the success of any project whether it is done by a small co-located group or by a globally dispersed team. And while the ubiquity of English facilitates basic communication, its use as a common language masks and disguises cultural differences and expectations. A foundation for cross-cultural communication and understanding cultural differences is not only useful but essential for any project executed by a geographically dispersed team. Culture is broadly defined as \"the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group of people from others\" (Hofstede and Jofstede, 2005). Culture is different from human nature because human nature is shared by all humans. Culture is also different from personality but the border between the two is difficult to pinpoint. Generally speaking culture is what one shares with one's compatriots.",

      "title": "Sociologists in Italy Between Cultural and Normative Legitimization. The Failed Construction of a Community of Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract The profession of sociologist in Italy has undergone the same ups and downs as the development of the discipline, which since its institutionalisation (which came very late) has always had to fight for autonomy and the search for legitimate recognition as a science within the wider world of social sciences (economics, political science, etc.). This has produced two conditions that have not favoured the construction of a real community of practice of sociologists: on the one hand, a scarce or total lack of cultural legitimization for the the work of the sociologist that is a consequence of a sociology perpetually in crisis and in search of political recognition and influence that has never been achieved; on the other hand, the separation between academic sociologists and professional sociologists which has resulted, for the former, in the analysis, explanation and interpretation (on the basis of different disciplinary paradigms) of sociocultural processes and changes in society, without any real direct involvement (theoretical sociology), while for the latter, in the comparison, measurement, evaluation of observable processes in the context of the social reality of which one is a part (applied sociology). This article focuses on the “lights” and “shadows” of the professional development of sociologists in Italy, starting from the assumption, however, that a regulatory legitimization can never be complete unless a cultural legitimization and recognition is achieved that can consolidate a professional identity that allows differentiation with other “neighbouring” professions.",

      "title": "Communication and Digital Emotions. the Desire of Community as a Dimension of the Existence",
      "abstract": "According to Ong (1986), for a long time, in the human history, direct or vis-à-vis communication has been the only modality of communication; traditions have essentially been oral and their survival depended on the continuous renewal, which was represented by the vis-à-vis narration of stories and activities. In this way, the oral culture has created some expedients to remind and let people remind some aspects: a certain structure of the speech (fixed themes, formulas, proverbs, rhythmic style, etc.), a particular kind of (narrative) speech, a specific behavioral schematization (“strong” characters, types). The communication process is always a fundamental and essential process (Wright, 1976): it involves individuals in a deep relationship inside which the linguistic and paralinguistic codes, which come into play, take on complex meanings. In fact, despite the apparent facility through which two or more people come into contact among them, the deep sense of communication is something which is complicated and mysterious. Each person, who is involved in the communication process, attributes, on the basis of his/her subjective and social-group existential experience, his/her own meaning to each sign. According to Wolton (2006), communication has to do with four dimensions, which are complementary among them: first of all, communication is the ideal of expression and exchange which is at the origin of the Western culture and of democracy; talking about democracy presumes, as a basic concept, the existence of free and equal individuals. Communication concerns also those media which have remarkably transformed the relationships between communication and society. Still, communication concerns the whole mechanism of the new technologies that, with information science, telecommunications, audiovisuals and their interconnection, have globally modified the premises of the exchange of messages and power. In the end, communication includes also all those values, those symbols and those representations which function as a mechanism for the functioning of the public space, of democracies and of the international community through information and media.",

Участь має забезпечу вати не відторгнення політичного від громадського, а усвідомлення суспільством власної значимості і суб'єктності. Зрештою, участь потрібна для корекції політичного курсу з тією метою, щоб не виникла полі тична каста, яка визначила певні пріоритети, витрачає на це ресурси, але які для суспільства не є акту альними. Безумовно, що модель, коли кожен громадянин особисто здійснює участь з різних питань і в різних сферах, є утопічною. Однак важливо, щоб така можливість існувала, що буде нівелювати потенційну на пруженість. Такі можливості ми називаємо канали доступу. Умовно особисте звернення, прийом грома дян, електронна петиція, зустріч та інші форми. Але не менш важливо, щоб державні інституції відповід но (адекватно) реагували. На жаль, школа \"відписок\", ігнорування, бюрократичних хитрощів знищує до віру в цій галузі, яка потім трансформується в недовіру державним інститутам загалом, суспільне неза доволення тощо. Для громадянина, який особисто не бере участь, важливо відчувати, що його соціальна група, як він себе ідентифікує, все ж має доступ і канал впливу -здійснює участь. Це означає, що в уявленнях і його інтерес представлений. Відтак породжується соціальний спокій і довіра. Більше того, потрібно розуміти, що цей громадянин може ідентифікувати себе з різними групами, як мешканець масиву, чи регіону; як певне покоління; як професійна спільнота; як спільнота прихильників певної ідеї. Всі ці групи повинні мати поліваріантність каналів доступу. Також відчуття, що твоя соціальна група представлена в політичному класі теж забезпечує відчуття участі. Але специфіка формування сучасного політичного класу в Україні руйнує цей канал. У тоталітарних режимах, як не дивно, прагнули максимально продемонструвати \"повну\" участь народу в державних справах. Це надавало режиму легітимність",

Sosyal medyanın günümüzdeki kullanım şekliyle salt sosyal etkilerinden değil aynı zamanda hukuki dayanağı olan etkilerinden söz etmek de mümkün hale gelmiştir. Gerek kullanıcıların yeterli teorik bilgiye sahip olmadan paylaşımlarda bulunması gerekse de sosyal medya konusundaki hukuki düzenlemelerin henüz çok kapsamlı olmaması gerekçesiyle kimi zaman kişilerin kişilik haklarının ihlaline kadar varabilen ve çeşitli mağduriyetlere yol açan çeşitli durumların ortaya çıktığı gözlemlenebilmektedir. Belli bir grup, millet ya da kesim hakkında yapılan sosyal medya paylaşımları, toplumun birer parçası olan kimi kesimler hakkında peşin hüküm oluşmasına ve sonrasında bu kişilerin sosyal yaşantılarında, etiketlenmelerine ya da toplumdan tecrit edilmelerine yol açan aksaklıklara sebep olabilmektedir. Bu durumun da spesifik örnekler üzerinden toplumsal infial yaratabilecek ya da dijital linç adı verilen durum aracılığıyla yaşandığını görmek mümkündür. Bu çalışmada yasal olarak sınırları çizilmiş olup suç olarak nitelendirilen ayrımcılığın; sosyal medyada yaşlılarla ilgili olan yönü incelenecektir. Öncelikle sosyal medya, kitle iletişim özgürlüğü ve dijital linç gibi konunun sosyal boyutu incelenecek ardından da konunun hukuki temelleri çalışmaya konu edilecektir. Derleme niteliğindeki bu çalışmanın amacı, literatürde linç kültürü olarak yer alan kavramla, hukuki olarak yaşlı ayrımcılığı şeklinde tanımlanmış kavram arasında yaşlılık sosyolojisi bakış açısıyla ilişki kurabilmektir. Bunun için, öncelikle kitle iletişim kavramı ve sosyal medyanın mahiyeti incelenmiş ardından da linç kültürü ve yaşlı ayrımcılığıyla ilgili hukuki dayanaklar ilişkilendirilmiştir. Çalışmanın sonucunda, sosyal mecralardaki söylem ve paylaşımların, ayrımcılığa neden olmak konusunda sosyolojik bir problem olabildiğine ulaşılmıştır.",

This article raises the question about the conditions under which a systemic steering of these problems is possible without exercising an authoritative intervention in social systems. The principle of a contextual systemic intervention as a pragmatic coordination of intransparencies are explained and illustrated. The function of this strategy consists in increasing the contingency of the addressee with communicative offers in the language of the system; its performance aims to deal with the diagnosed problems.",

The problem of suburban conurbations marginal youngsters social integration is a social issue that has acquired increa­sing importance in the last decades in the European metropolis; becoming a challenge for public institutions. Those make efforts to modernize their interven­tion strategies and actively involve the different socialization institutions: family and school, but they face the need to reinvent them given the sharp crisis they are passing through. My conclusions and my research break through the criminal sociology and social integration classical approaches that have dominated public institutions policy. They considered either useless the effort to so­cialize after the adolescence (Sigmund Freud considered not possible to recover post adolescents) or they considered ne­cessary to overcome the social class diffe­rences as a previous and compulsory step for social exclusion disappearance (Karl Marx’ social revolution as previous step).

In recent years design professionals have been pushing design beyond being just engaged with consumer culture and exploring new forms of practice. This is particularly evident when design is used to tackle social issues to create innovative solutions (Margolin & Margolin, 2002; Fuad-Luke, 2009). There is growing consensus that design can be a mode of innovation that provides a set of skills, tools and methods that guide people to new socially innovative solutions or improvement of existing ones (Brooks, 2011; Emilson, Seravalli & Hillgren, 2011; Social Innovation Exchange, 2011a). Social innovation is \"innovation that is explicitly for the social and public good. It is innovation inspired by the desire to meet social needs which can be neglected by traditional forms of private market provision and which have often been poorly served or unresolved by services organised by the state\" (Murray, Caulier-Grice & Mulgan, 2010:10). After a very brief review of sustainable development and how design professionals have addressed the concepts, this paper will explore 'design for social innovation', its emerging principles and approaches and the opportunities and challenges for design professionals engaging in it.",

      "abstract": "In his trenchant critique of structural linguistics, Bourdieu (1991) observes that linguistics as an academic discipline has been far too pre-occupied with idealist, abstracted approaches to the study of language—examining language in isolation from the social and political conditions in which it is used. As he comments ironically of this process: ‘bracketing out the social […] allows language or any other symbolic object to be treated like an end in itself, [this] contributed considerably to the success of structural linguistics, for it endowed the “pure” exercises that characterise a purely internal and formal analysis with the charm of a game devoid of consequences’ (1991: 34). Or as Mey observes, ‘linguistic models, no matter how innocent and theoretical they may seem to be, not only have distinct economical, social and political presuppositions, but also consequences […] Linguistic (and other) inequalities don’t cease to exist simply because their […] causes are swept under the linguistic rug’ (1985: 26).",

      "title": "Coordination processes in conversation : the cases of gaze in greetings and storytelling in teaching",
      "abstract": "Throughout human evolution, face-to-face conversational interaction has been the primary means of communication in everyday life. It is the fundamental setting for human interaction and so ideal to gain insights into the nature of communication (Schegloff, 2007). Humans communicate primarily to solve problems of cooperation, and these cooperation problems are a source of evolutionary pressure that has shaped the nature of social interaction. This thesis focuses on the cases of two recurrent coordination problems in communication, and the behavioural adaptations specialised to resolve them. One recurrent interactional problem we face is how to begin face-to-face social interactions (Pillet-Shore, 2018). Contrary to what we might first think, social interactions do not begin by people simply starting to speak, instead they must engage with each other methodically through a combination of verbal and non-verbal cues in order to get into the interaction (Mondada et al., 2020). Gaze is specialised during greeting behaviour to solve this problem by initiating social interaction. Another recurrent interactional problem faced by all human cultures is passing on information and skills to prevent them from dying out from one generation to the next. This is commonly achieved through the social activity of teaching (Kline, 2015), particularly through the specialised teaching method of storytelling (Scalise Sugiyama, 2017). The cases of gaze in greetings and storytelling in teaching illustrate how humans have adapted to facilitate social interaction, providing broad insight into coordination processes in communication.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Participation has become a buzz word in many an economic and social context. This however hides the fact that there is a great variety of different participative practices, both on micro and macro levels, practiced for very different purposes. Sometimes speaking of participation is just juggling with names. In many enterprises market driven work organisations offer “participation” to employees, which is in fact a device to misuse employees’ interest in “authentic participation” (Fals Borda, 2013/2007) for increasing the efficiency of work by dependent autonomy. In modern forms of so called interactive value creation via the internet we find another practice: so called participation of consumers or online communities of co-producers in designing, creating or improving (new) products. Even in trade unions the use and practice of participation is sometimes ambivalent. In order to distinguish authentic participation in the interest of participants from the misuse of participation for different interests (increase in efficiency; exploitation of participants’ creative capacities) this author coins the term of democratic participation, characterised by, among others, democratic dialogue between subjects (no othering business); collective reflection; giving a voice to all participants. Finally it is argued that the practice of democratic participation may open horizons of utopia. Keywords: authentic participation, democratic participation, participation on micro and macro levels, trade unions’ participative practices, inflationary use of the term participation",

      "abstract": "Whether on a first date or during a team briefing at work, people’s daily lives are inundated with social information, and in recent years, researchers have begun studying the neural mechanisms that support social-information processing. We argue that the focus of social neuroscience research to date has been skewed toward specialized processes at the expense of general processing mechanisms with a consequence that unrealistic expectations have been set for what specialized processes alone can achieve. We propose that for social neuroscience to develop into a more mature research program, it needs to embrace hybrid models that integrate specialized person representations with domain-general solutions, such as prioritization and selection, which operate across all classes of information (both social and nonsocial). To illustrate our central arguments, we first describe and then evaluate a hybrid model of information processing during social interactions that (a) generates novel and falsifiable predictions compared with existing models; (b) is predicated on a wealth of neurobiological evidence spanning many decades, methods, and species; (c) requires a superior standard of evidence to substantiate domain-specific mechanisms of social behavior; and (d) transforms expectations of what types of neural mechanisms may contribute to social-information processing in both typical and atypical populations.",

Hence the organizations should look at humans as multilayered, not only as professional entities. In synergy, not only individually, we define humans as: (1) physical, (2) mental, (3) social, (4) spiritual, and (5) economic entities, marked by requisitely, though not absolutely holistic pattern of relatively permanent characteristics, due to which the individuals differ from each other, and also as (6) specialized professionals. All these and other attributes form synergies.Thus, we define the requisite holism of an employee as an individual existing and conscious of self as (1) Physical person, implementing active techniques to gain physical balance, (2) Mental entity, enriching sentiment, perception, mind and will-power by life-balancing techniques, (3) Social entity, building quality communication with others by the techniques of professional and working development and social integrity, (4) Spiritual entity, longing after selfactualization and the sense of life, carrying it into effect by the techniques of spiritual development and (5) Economic entity, striving to satisfy her material needs as a person, family member, co-worker and as a member of a wider society by using one’s profession. In this way the behavior of individuals, who are willing to practice interdisciplinary co-operation, becomes socially responsible. One can implement also management of requisite personal holism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social control is such a widely recognized concept that one would suspect that a consensual definition of it exists. That is not the case. While one can generally define social control as the formal and informal processes that socialize, sanction, and/or reward individuals for conformity, and produce social regularity, specific definitions of social control vary widely (see Meier's 1982 discussion on this point and his fascinating history of the concept). In its broadest definition, childhood socialization plays an important role in social control, ongoing social influence processes such as shaming rituals play critical roles in informal social control, and law enforcement and the legal system play critical roles in formal social control. Moreover, social control can involve fairly innocent creations of conformity that generally bring great social good (i.e., driving on the same side of the street and acknowledging and abiding by common rules of the road) or can involve a dark side where conformity is achieved through the loss of liberty, individuality, and free expression. Perhaps because of this breadth and dimensionality, Sutton (1996) has argued that the concept goes too far and is too imprecise; he recommends abandoning the term altogether and using a more precise term such as sanctioning instead.",

      "title": "Knowledge And Human Interests",
      "abstract": "Introduction There are many practices and interests that human beings can have including, economic, financial, social, cultural, educational etc. Knowledge and human interests starts with the premise that there are two fundamental conditions underpinning the socio-cultural system: \"work\" and \"interaction.\" Work enables human beings to achieve goals and bring about material well-being through social labor. Interaction concerns securing and, expanding the possibilities for mutual understanding among all those involved in social dynamics. From these two conditions three essential human interests namely technical, practical and emancipatory can be derived: 1.1 Technical Interest The success of work depends on the mastery over natural and social processes, hence, we have a \"technical interest\" in securing prediction and control. 1.2 Practical Interest Lack of mutual understanding is just as much a threat to the reproduction of the socio-cultural form of life as is the failure to predict and control, thus we have a practical (communicative) interest in generating mutual understanding. 1.3 Emancipatory Interest The analysis of power and the manner in which it is exercised is vital if we are to understand past and present social arrangements. The exercise of power represents a threat to both technical and communicative interests hence we must also have an \"emancipatory interest\" in freeing human beings from constraints imposed by power relations and to allow self-determination. The convergence of these above mentioned three interests constitutes knowledge by which we may apprehend the society and the world in any possible way desired. These three interests represent the skeleton on which we can build a healthy and a progressive society. A socio-cultural system based on these interests includes design of good systems, debate and emancipation, a balanced combination of which leads to entrepreneurship, innovation and change. 2. DISCUSSION The following is a brief discussion on design, debate and emancipation, culminating into enterpreneurship, innovation and change. 2.1 Design The concern here is to reach means-ends and is usually achieved through hard system thinking, which originates from imperical sciences (true/false) and is one of the three main human interests. The basis of interest here is to carry-out work to achieve our goals and objectives. The goal may include controlling nature, machinery, people and even nations. In technical interest, the relationship between human and nature is mainly governed by and/or dependent on prediction and control. History tells us that our ancestors worked very hard to control nature and to use it for their individual benefit as well as that of the societies they lived in. Examples of these include, building bridges and canals to facilitate transportation of goods, dams to control floods and make use of the reservoir water during dry season. A further example of human technical interests is the use of instrumentation, machinery and equipment for prediction and control and carrying-out some tasks, such as drilling deep oil and gas' wells, that would have been impossible without them.

      "abstract": "Social exclusion has been identified as an issue of concern in Australia and internationally, and describes the inability to fully engage in society because of social characteristics that reduce opportunities for successful social engagement (Ferguson, 2008; Saunders, Naidoo, & Griffiths, 2008). It has been linked with a range of health and social outcomes, including disconnectedness, violence, drug and alcohol use, depression, stress and reduced perception of life as meaningful (Hardiman & Lapeyre, 2004; Mao et al., 2009; Morgan, Burns, Fitzpatrick, Pinfold, & Priebe, 2007; Saunders et al., 2008; Stillman et al., 2009), and is associated with multiple factors including family breakdown, unemployment, social security dependence, educational disadvantage and loss of identity (Hardiman & Lapeyre, 2004).The very nature of social exclusion means that individuals can sometimes choose to remain elusive for various reasons such as fear of stigma and negative judgement. However, even people who are socially marginalised and excluded will seek out community- based health and support services, and in any working day, primary health care workers (PHCWs) encounter people who are socially excluded through isolation, stigmatisation, marginalisation, lack of voice, invisibility, distress, or lack of resources to improve their situations. Thus, PHCWs should be well positioned to establish trust and develop familiarity with those who are socially excluded.This vital workforce faces challenges associated with dealing with 'new' and perplexing health and social problems associated with exclusion or the outcomes arising from social exclusion. To borrow a military metaphor, the primary care workforce forms the 'front line' in managing complex and sometimes confronting health and social issues that may not yet have been adequately resourced. In an exploration of the experiences of general practitioners in providing care to gay and HIV positive men with problematic crystal methamphetamine use, the need to ensure adequate resourcing and support for the health workforce was identified (Saltman, Newman, Mao, Kippax, & Kidd, 2008). Furthermore, some reluctance on the part of the acute care sector and referral services to accept participation in the care of these complex patients was noted, meaning that despite lack of resourcing, the full responsibility for care remained within the primary care sector (Saltman et al., 2008).Another consequence of social exclusion is violence. Violence is strongly associated with social exclusion (Hardiman & Lapeyre, 2004). It is pervasive in community health settings and a known hazard. Though often framed as being essentially an interpersonal matter, violence has effects that go far beyond the direct protagonists, to the wider family, community and therapeutic contexts (Carmody, 2006; Jackson & McMurray, 2006; Luck, Jackson, & Usher, 2008). In a study that sought to explore the effects of witnessing community violence on women's anxiety and depressive symptomology, findings revealed that being a bystander to such violence was associated with an increase in clinically significant symptoms (Clark et al., 2008). This is concerning, not only when considering the prevalence of violence in many communities, but also when the focus of care in some primary health care settings is the management of one problem only at a time, as is the growing trend in UK general practice. Furthermore, it raises questions about the possible deleterious health effects of witnessing violence on the health workforce, given the well-documented and unacceptably high levels of violence and abuse encountered by health workers (Luck et al., 2008; Miedema, Easley, Fortin, Hamilton, & Tatemichi, 2009). Despite quite extensive research interrogation, these co-morbid aspects of violence are poorly understood and relatively unexplored.Another arena of unrecognised violence is that of young people toward their mothers. …",

      "title": "Moving between the big and the small: Identity and interaction in digital contexts",
      "abstract": "The question of how people construct their identities through their interactions with each other \nhas been and remains central in the study of digital communication. In part, the ongoing centrality of this concern is an outworking of the discursive turn in the social sciences, which framed \nidentity as a fluid, plural accomplishment that is constantly under negotiation rather than a single, \nstable and essentialist entity. The focus on the discursive construction of identity was particularly \nwell suited to the forms of digital communication emerging in the 1990s, where the text-based \n(written) interactions in online contexts could be taken as examples of disembodied identity \nplay through the use of anonymity or pseudonyms (Turkle 1995), and interpreted as yielding \ndemocratic potential which allowed for greater articulation of previously marginalized identities. \nBut over the last two decades, a more complex picture has emerged in which the contexts of \ninteraction where identities are played out are no longer polarized in simplistic, binary contrasts \nas online or offline, text-based or embodied, playful or authentic. The use of digital communication is embedded in day-to-day interactions in physical locations (Jones 2005) and the identities \nwhich are constructed offline are also multiple, shifting and unstable. There is also recognition \nthat the participatory culture associated with social media has not done away with existing \nhierarchies – indeed, they are often reproduced rather than eradicated in online contexts. (See \nHerring’s (2003) early critique of gender hierarchies in forums and Marwick and boyd’s (2011) \nobservations on the hierarchies of celebrity and fame; see also Graham, this volume).",

      "title": "Identity, dignity and taboos: beliefs as assets",
      "abstract": "We analyze social and economic phenomena involving beliefs which people value and invest in, for affective or functional reasons. Individuals are at times uncertain about their own “deep values” and infer them from their past choices, which then come to define “who they are”. Identity investments increase when information is scarce or when a greater endowment of some asset (wealth, career, family, culture) raises the stakes on viewing it as valuable (escalating commitments). Taboos against transactions or the mere contemplation of tradeoffs arise to protect fragile beliefs about the “priceless” value of certain assets (life, freedom, love, faith) or things one “would never do”. Whether such behaviors are welfare-enhancing or reducing depends on whether beliefs are sought for a functional value (sense of direction, self-discipline) or for “mental consumption” motives (self-esteem, anticipatory feelings). Escalating commitments can thus lead to a “hedonic treadmill”, and competing identities cause dysfunctional failures to invest in high-return activities (education, adapting to globalization, assimilation), or even the destruction of productive assets. In social interactions, norm violations elicit a forceful response (exclusion, harassment) when they threaten a strongly held identity, but further erode morale when it was initially weak. Concerns for pride, dignity or wishful thinking lead to the inefficient breakdown of Coasian bargaining even under symmetric information, as partners seek to self-enhance and shift blame by turning down “insultingly low” offers.",

      "abstract": "Collective intelligence allows groups of individuals to solve problems which otherwise could not be solved by a single individual. Insect workers have tiny brains, but by functioning as part of a self-organized colony, they find sophisticated solutions to vital organizational problems (e.g., finding a suitable new home or exploiting the best food sources in a changing environment). In consensus decision making, unanimity among workers is crucial. In contrast, combined decision making requires that different groups of workers within the colony chose different options. Communication and learning are often fundamental in collective decision making. However, as workers gain experience, communication may lose importance as an information source for workers. How social insects collectively solve problems parallels decision making in other biological sys- tems (e.g., neuronal networks), and investigation into social insect collective decision making has inspired new solutions to optimization problems in areas such as computer sciences and the organization of communication networks.",

      "title": "Caracterización de los espacios vocálicos de dos variantes sociolectales del castellano chileno: fundamentos teóricos y propuesta metodológica para un estudio del habla carcelaria.",
      "abstract": "Como se ha planteado en estudios anteriores, el sistema fonético del castellano chileno se caracteriza por una alta variación a nivel sociolingüístico, la que se evidencia de manera clara en las consonantes que lo componen, las cuales se encuentran estratificadas por variables sociales, como por ejemplo, nivel socioeconómico, sexo-género y nivel educativo (e.g., Sadowsky, 2015). Aunque existen algunas excepciones (e.g. Salamanca y Valverde, 2009), los sistemas vocálicos del castellano chileno han recibido menos atención y se han investigado con menor profundidad. De estas investigaciones, algunas han encontrado evidencia que sugiere que los subsistemas vocálicos están experimentando un proceso de divergencia dialectal, el cual puede estar relacionado con el nivel socioeconómico y grupo etario de los hablantes (Figueroa, Rogers y Fuentes, 2021). La ausencia de estudios sobre sistemas vocálicos se vuelve más notoria en la falta de investigaciones relacionadas al habla de personas pertenecientes a otros espacios socio-demográficos, como es el caso del habla de personas privadas de libertad, cuyo número en 2018 ascendía a 40.730 (Boletín Estadístico Gendarmería de Chile, 2019). Si bien se han considerado estudios en otras áreas de la lingüística para este tipo de comunidad, no existen precedentes de investigación para el nivel fonético-fonológico. El presente estudio propone obtener una primera evidencia de las propiedades fonético-acústicas del sistema vocálico de hablantes masculinos en situación de reclusión en cárceles chilenas (en adelante, “reclusos”), así como entregar una primera comparación de este sistema vocálico con el de otras dos comunidades de habla: un grupo de 9 hablantes que completaron estudios universitarios (en adelante, “profesionales”) y un grupo de 9 hablantes que no terminaron su educación secundaria (en adelante, “no profesionales”). Los datos se obtuvieron desde entrevistas semi-dirigidas, las que fueron registradas utilizando grabadoras digitales y micrófonos de alta calidad. Estas grabaciones fueron analizadas y anotadas en TextGrids del programa Praat (Boersma y Weenink, 2022), para lo cual se realizaron análisis auditivos y observaciones de la información provista por la forma de onda y espectrogramas. Posteriormente, se obtuvieron los datos acústicos mediante scripts del propio programa Praat. Con estas herramientas se extrajeron y promediaron valores de F1 y F2, para ambos casos esta medición se realizó en los puntos 20% y 35% de la duración de cada una de las vocales, esto de acuerdo a las recomendaciones de autores especializados como Fox y Jacewicz (2012). A través de los procesos realizados se constituyó el corpus a trabajar, el cual alcanza un total de más de 38.000 vocales o instancias vocálicas. Los análisis se basaron en los resultados de las comparaciones de los tres grupos de hablantes de acuerdo a valores de referencia de F1 y F2, cálculo de distancias euclidianas, cálculo de valores de superposición de espacios vocálicos, estimación del tamaño de espacios vocálicos y resultados de la ejecución de pruebas estadísticas tipo MANOVA. Los resultados obtenidos señalan que existe una clara tendencia tal que el sistema vocálico presentado por el grupo “profesionales” es más centralizado, con alta superposición de las categorías vocálicas, mientras que hablantes “reclusos” presentan un sistema vocálico opuesto, es decir, cuenta con la menor superposición de los tres grupos, manifestando categorías vocálicas altamente diferenciadas (el sistema vocálico de los hablantes “no profesionales” muestra valores intermedios a los de los otros dos grupos). Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que las vocales articuladas por los hablantes privados de libertad, además de poseer propiedades fonético-acústicas distintas a otras comunidades de habla, efectivamente se encuentran experimentando un proceso de divergencia dialectal, en referencia a las vocales de otros grupos de hablantes (Hinskens, Jeffrey y Taelfeman, 2000).",

      "title": "Social Simulation Based on Cellular Automata: Modeling Language Shifts",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, language shifts (i.e., a community of speakers stops using their traditional language and speaks a new one in all communication settings) may produce a massive extinction of languages throughout the world. In this context, an important task for social sciences research should therefore be to achieve a deep comprehension of language shifts. However, modeling the social and behavioral variables that guide the social behavior of individuals and groups has traditionally been tricky in all the social sciences. In this situation, social simulation provides a tool for testing hypotheses and building models of social phenomena (see, for example, Gilbert, 1996; Gilbert & Toitzsch, 2005; and Goldspink, 2002), especially the techniques based on cellular automata theory (Hegselmann, 1996; Hegselman & Flache, 1998; Nowak & Lewenstein, 1996). According to this framewok, we introduce the properties of a cellular automaton that incorporates some assumptions from the Gaelic-Arvanitika model of language shifts (Sasse, 1992) and the findings on the dynamics of social impacts in the field of social psychology (Latane, 1981; Nowak et al. 1990). Thus, we define a cellular automaton and carry out a set of simulations in which it is used. We incorporate empirical data from recent sociolinguistic studies in Catalonia (a region in Southern Europe) to run the automaton under different scenarios. The results allow us to highlight some of the main factors involved in a language shift. Finally, we also discuss how the social simulation based on cellular automata theory approach proves to be a useful tool for understanding language shifts.",

Where language has been considered by IB scholars, it has been thought of only in terms of discrete national languages, and how these are used by organizations in general terms, and not in relation to the choices that individuals make at a micro-level within organizations to get their work done. In other words, it has not considered language as social action in business contexts or sought to understand \"how people achieve their organizational and personal goals using language\" (Bargiela-Chiappini et al., 2013: 3). In addition, much of the existing literature on cross-cultural management (CCM) has relied on etic approaches, for instance, Hall's (1976) work on high and low context cultures and Hofstede's (2001) work on cultural dimensions, which typically ignore the use of national languages and how these are realized as discourse. The IB literature has not considered why people in organizations choose one language over another and the impact that this choice may have on their personal and organizational goals, nor has it considered why people in multicultural contexts choose to align themselves with certain individuals and not with others beyond the constraints of language choice.",

      "title": "Encouraging New Encounters: Digital Design Patterns to Support Social Wellbeing",
      "abstract": "Interpersonal contact can be crucial to subjective wellbeing (Miesen and Schaafsma, 2008) as social isolation can create vicious spirals of self-destructive behaviour that further decreases lonely individuals’ social skills and motivations towards sociability (Caccioppo and Patrick, 2009). Lacking social connection has also been argued to have negative impacts on physiological health (ibid). However, developing new interpersonal connections is an elixir that is easy to prescribe but difficult to supply. Initiating a conversation with strangers is difficult for many people (Crozier, 1990) and successfully approaching strangers in public places necessitates considerable skills (Mondada, 2009). Computer scientists, interaction designers, new media artists and other inventive practitioners and researchers have undertaken a wide variety of experimentation with digital means to support social icebreaking, and reduce inhibitions on initiating new encounters. Formats and media range from responsive architecture, installations and dynamic furniture to handheld gadgets and wearables. But despite the breadth and novelty of design concepts, these efforts seem to have made little headway in reducing social isolation. Addressing this challenge is hindered by several factors including a) how prior work for sparking new interpersonal contacts is scattered across many different fields and disciplines b) the challenge of articulating the complexity and unpredictability of interpersonal interactions and c) the lack of shared vocabularies for how digital mechanisms, technologies and techniques may influence how people perceive and act towards each other. In this paper, we present findings from a participatory and iterative review of design examples (Mitchell 2015, Mitchell and Olsson 2017). To support interdisciplinary exchange, we present the results of our review in the accessible format of design patterns. Design patterns are illustrated abstractions capturing re-usable solutions to recurring problems (Alexander, 1977). We conducted an iterative, and participatory design space review that connected clusters of diverse inventions with explanations of specific difficulties with initiating new encounters that they might each support. Expert interviews with diverse practitioners critiqued and fine-tuned our initial results. Furthermore, we will un pack our latest digital design patterns for social wellbeing through comparisons with less novel technologies and insights from social science literature.",

      "title": "Micro Social Orders",
      "abstract": "ing the Theory The theory can be abstracted by recasting key terms more broadly. Social interaction S On the basis of these propositions about joint tasks, the affect theory of exchange offers several hypotheses about structural effects on micro social orders. Aside from analyzing the different forms of exchange (negotiated, etc.), the theory can predict when networks are likely to evolve into groups and when attachments to relations are stronger than to larger social units-that is, networks or groups. (For details, see Lawler 2001a). This content downloaded from 157.55.39.248 on Thu, 28 Jul 2016 05:38:26 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 12 SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY can be substituted for social exchange; joint activities can be substituted for joint tasks; and the activities or tasks involved in an episode of social interaction can vary along the same structural and perceptual dimensions as do exchange tasks-that is, in nonseparability and shared responsibility. The results (benefits) of social interaction produce global emotional responses: successful interaction makes them feel good and unsuccessful interaction makes them feel bad (also see Collins 1981). Under the conditions specified by the affect theory, social-unit attributions for these emotions occur. On the broadest level, the fundamental proposition about micro solidarity is captured by a simple causal chain, portrayed in Figure 2. The upshot is that social interaction involves implicit or explicit joint activities based in a social structure, and these generate benefits for actors. These activities may involve spending a pleasant evening with friends, deciding what cultural event to attend, dividing child care responsibilities in a household, and so forth. Emotional experiences-feeling good or feeling bad-follow from these activities. Although these are not under the actors' direct control, the actors can control them to some extent by understanding the situational conditions under which they occur and by influencing those conditions, or engaging in appropriate approach/avoidance behaviors. These everyday emotions and feelings in social interaction are not only internal reinforcements but also internal signals about the course of social interaction, akin to those analyzed in affect control theory (Heise 1979). According to my theory, they are interpreted in collective terms under specified conditions. Moreover, through the theorized process, successful interaction strengthens the emotional basis of both interpersonal and personto-group ties. Integrating Ideas on Micro Solidarity The idea that repetitive or recurrent interaction is a basis for order, cohesion, or solidarity at the micro level is an underlying theme across a wide variety of theoretical traditions and perspectives. Homans (1961), Berger and Luckmann (1966), Randall Collins (1981), Cook and Emerson (1984), Molm (1994), and Dennis Wrong (1995), for example, incorporate this theme. The relevant literature contains four variations on the theme; these, in turn, represent complementary explanations for the social-order effects of recurrent interaction. One class of explanations is social constructionism. Berger and Luckmann (1966) theorize that all actions repeated once or more tend to be habitualized to some degree (p. 57). Actors interpret and ascribe larger meaning to the fact that they interact with the same actors repeatedly; interpretations of habitualization generate reciprocal typifications-that is, consensual definitions of the overarching relationship. In this process, the relation or group becomes an object for actors-a force beyond self and other in the social context-and actors orient themselves to this object. Cognitively based expectations of the other are a second type of explanation-that is, the ability to anticipate and predict the other's preferences, beliefs, and behavioral tendencies. Repetitive interaction creates mutual knowledge that enables each actor to form reliable expectations of how the other will behave and respond, and to adjust their behavior in advance. Examples of this approach include the uncertainty-reduction explanation for commitment (Kollock 1994) as well as trust explanations, where trust is defined as an expectation of cooperation (Pruitt and Kimmel 1977; Yamagishi 1995). The overall point is that actors choose to continue interaction with partners with whom they expect mutual cooperation.

Basic Causal Sequence, Micro Solidarity This content downloaded from 157.55.39.248 on Thu, 28 Jul 2016 05:38:26 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms MICRO SOCIAL ORDERS 13 Normative-based expectations are a third class of explanations for micro social orders. Normative expectations can be imposed exogenously or generated endogenously; in either case, they accord relationships a moral/ethical legitimation. Role theory (Turner 1978) and structural identity theory (Stryker 1980) exemplify this type of explanation. In Stryker's theory, self-other definitions are tied to roles embedded in a social structure, and commitment to those roles depends on the salience of the associated identities. Roles invoke culturally meaningful names for actors, and normative expectations are associated with those names. Actors call upon these to guide their own behavior and to anticipate others' behavior, but in the course of social interaction, they also refine or reshape their identities and related expectations. Normative expectations are partly negotiated; thus they are both exogenous and endogenous (see Stryker 1980; Turner 1978). A fourth class of explanations is the emotional/affective. Following Durkheim (1915), Collins's (1981) theory of interaction ritual chains posits explicitly that recurrent social interaction is the most fundamental basis for social order at both macro and micro levels. He ties this idea to the emotional aspects of interaction (i.e., feelings of confidence and uplift). Collins theorizes that social interaction strengthens group solidarity particularly when actors have a common focus of which they are aware and when they experience common emotions or feelings that grow stronger over time (Collins 1981, 1989). Emotional experiences in interaction make group memberships more salient and more real to actors; as a result, actors begin to perceive a moral obligation to one another. The theory of relational cohesion builds on several elements in Collins's theory of interaction",

      "abstract": "My interest in the question of how people experience their gender began with my empirical studies of families (König 2012).In the narratives of women and men who live together with children, I observed that gendered ways of being include definitions, roles, social categories, conventions, and feelings that are explicit, known, and thus easy to say, such as: I'm a bad mother because I work a lot.Obviously, this statement by a woman relates to a pattern that is constitutive of the binary gender order of bourgeois societies.Women are responsible for (the wellbeing of) their children and should therefore be at home.In such statements the social category of being a mother, the personal understanding of one's tasks as mother, and language are very closely connected (Scott 1991: 794).However, \"the available social categories aren't sufficient\" (ibid.: 795) to express the meaning of the experiences people have around work and family.There is often something intangible about one's gender in a specific situation.This intangible something became apparent in many of my interviews. 2 There are moments in the interviews when the narratives stop flowing.The interviewees lack words, start to stutter, or use figures of speech such as: Coming home from work, which takes place far away from home, I feel like an empty shell. 3If I had signaled that the expression of unclear ideas, impulses, and thoughts that may seem crazy at first was welcome, many interviewees made use of this chance to find out what exactly it is that they felt or perceived and started to explore their meaning of social categories, gendered roles, and situations (König 2012; König/Wojahn 2016; König/ Maihofer 2004).When the woman who feels like an empty shell starts to explore this",

It is said that the main criterion for key positions was the presence of close family and friendly relations, joint business, general interests, own needs and patronage-it is about favoritism. It is determined that favoritism is a type of communication that forms social relations that \"progress\" during crises, transformations, in the periods of social changes; It is a certain culture of behavior, the vision of the world and to impose their perspective (personal) on personnel policy in the collective. In Ukrainian realities, favoritism became an abnormal zone in the system of public administration at different levels, where there are: unworked work in a team; Blurring of functional duties of employees; Absence of motivation in work of collective; Incompetence Favorites, which is written back to others. It is noted that favoritism is difficult to diagnose, but it is inherent in certain signs: the lack of qualification qualities in the favorite; Rapid career growth; Using the mechanism \"quid pro quo\"-indirect form of relations; One of the employees apologizes the violation of all-general rules and norms, labor discipline; Support of the manager in business meetings, negotiations; Making non-competent decisions; Constant bragging, mainly for the organization of the process, rather than the result.

      "abstract": "Defining social entails describing the roles and functions of social workers. Although many attempts have been made to define social work, there have been some disagreements in trying to come up with a universal definition of social work. Thus, without a general agreement on what constitutes social work, it is difficult to definitively delineate what the roles and functions of social are or should be. The apparent failure to reach an agreement on what social is partly accounts for the gap between what social workers say they want to achieve and what they are practically able to achieve ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk ). According to Cree (2003:3), â€œit is almost impossible to find a simple definition of social with which everyone is likely to agreeâ€. Be that as it may, various scholars have attempted to develop definitions of social work, ranging from the seemingly simple and straightforward ones to the relatively complex and comprehensive, including the following.According to Farley and Smith (2006:7), â€œsocial is an art, a science, a profession that helps people to solve personal, group (especially family), and community problems and to attain satisfying personal, group, and community relationships through social practiceâ€. Probably the most comprehensive, authoritative and most widely used definitions of the concept is the one that states that social is â€œa profession which promotes social change, problem solving in human relationships and the empowerment and liberation of people to enhance well-being. Utilizing theories of human behavior and social systems, social intervenes at the points where people interact with their environments.

      "abstract": "The importance of \"character\" or non-cognitive skills to socio-economic success has received much interest from across the social sciences, and in policy. However, there is little clarity as to what the non-cognitive comprises, or how or for whom it contributes to socio-economic outcomes. I consider a range of measures of children’s self-beliefs and behaviors, and of class reproduction, in the British Cohort Study, a representative sample of Britons born in 1970. Model-based factor analysis finds there is no general non-cognitive dimension to skills. Children’s self-concept and teacher-ratings of their self-control form two distinct factors, with the latter in particular closely related to cognitive skill. Natural effect models find self-concept as well as self-control helps account for social immobility, the lower chances of attaining the middle class, and the (higher) professional-managerial class, for those from working-class, and non-elite backgrounds. Much, but not all, of the mediation role of character reflects its association with performance on cognitive tests. Non-cognitive factors thus matter to socio-economic outcomes, but in a way more consistent with Bourdieusian models of cultural capital than with economic conceptions of human capital.",

      "title": "The power of the language we use: Stigmatization of individuals and fellow nurses with substance use issues",
      "abstract": "Language is a guide to \"social reality\"…. Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society (pp. 209−210). In the \"linguistic relativity principle,\" Whorf (1956, p. 221) describes how our language directs us to certain observations, which in turn, creates different perceptions about those in society, including stigmatizing views. Nurses' stigmatization of certain individuals who use health services is a phenomenon that reaches beyond AUD and SUD diagnoses (Copeland, 2022). When a group is stigmatized, it is about power relations. For nurses, stigmas are formed in the socialization process and social interactions with individuals that fail to fall within behavioral norms, which then produces discriminatory vocabularies and labeling (Copeland, 2022). As we continue our editorial series on learning the language of health equity, this paper seeks to advance our understanding of evidence-based and person-centered ways to use appropriate language when engaging with nurses or individuals who have challenges with substance use. Within the context of SUD, the language we use, our discourses, our observations of the world around us, construct how we perceive and react to the world and those individuals in it. Thus, depending on our language usage, we may not only reflect stigma toward those with SUD, but create stigma, reinforce it, and contribute to its sustainment. The recent National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) initiative, \"Words Matter, Preferred Language for Talking about Addiction\" (June 23, 2021), supports how we can create a new reality by adopting a new vernacular. Table 1 is one of several provided by NIDA (2021). Each table provides concrete language usage for SUD and offers suggestions to reduce stigma and the discrimination it can cause. For example, \"impaired nurse,\" are words that create mental images of individuals who have lost control of their lives and bodies and are unable to function, thus, influencing our observations and interactions. In 2011, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing denounced the use of the term, \"impaired nurse\" as it implied the individual was functioning poorly or incompetently when in reality, the \"nurse with a SUD can be high-functioning and high-achieving\" (p. 3). It should be noted that the preference for use of terms related to SUD is an individual one. In a similar way that personal pronouns are used to indicate gender identities (e.g., they/them/their; she/her/hers; he/him/his) (Soled et al., 2022). Individuals in recovery may prefer the term \"addict\" because it is a term that they identify with, whereas others may not. Some individuals may identify with the term \"alcoholic\" and use it with sponsors and in testimonials, indicating that they have accepted their disease and its effect on their lives while some may not. The use of these terms for SUD may also be context specific. For example, some individuals may use terms like \"alcoholic\" or \"addict\" in certain settings such as recovery groups and prefer \"person with SUD\" in clinical or other healthcare settings. Other individuals may use terminology that focuses on their recovery work such as \"person in recovery\" or \"sober person.\" Therefore, like how personal pronouns indicating gender identities are respected, we can ask permission to use terms that individuals with AUD and SUD may want us to use. Requesting clarification indicates respect, a willingness to learn, humility, and provides a sense of psychological safety to the person. For nurses and other healthcare providers, it is part of providing person-centered care. Person-first language. The change shows that a person \"has\" a problem rather than \"is\" the problem. The terms avoid eliciting negative associations, punitive attitudes, and individual blame. Often the best example of a place where we can change our use of language is in reference to ourselves and the nursing profession, which we define broadly as including registered nurses (RNs), and advance practice RNs (e.g., nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists). Further, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants, and registered midwives are critical in providing care, therefore, it behooves all groups of formal caregivers to adopt principles of using more equitable language. If we can use less stigmatizing language in reference to the members of our professions, then we are more likely to be able to do so for the people we care for in healthcare settings. Through understanding the challenges faced by members of our own profession, we can also better understand the experiences of individuals who have and/or continue to face similar challenges. Like all individuals with AUD and SUD, and to a greater extent, nurses who struggle with these conditions are particularly vulnerable to stigmatization. For the 20th consecutive year, the Gallup Poll reported that the public rated nurses highest for honesty and ethics (Saad, 2022). Nursing has been consistently ranked as the most trusted profession, therefore, the high standard of respect bestowed by the American public toward nurses makes any \"deviation\" from the trusted image stigmatizing. When nurses stumble, fall, and fail, nursing colleagues tend to show less mercy than would be shown toward other individuals outside the profession. This is not a new trend and was described 35 years ago by Curtin (1987), when she coined the phrase \"throw-away nurses,\" a disdainful term, and one she challenged. Curtin (1987), in her thought piece, cited an example of a nurse who had been a role model for her and who was found to have been diverting medications. Curtain made a point of describing her devastation on behalf of this nurse, who then lost her license, her professional position, and her \"freedom\" (p. 7). It is extremely disappointing that so much of what Curtin wrote over three decades ago still has relevance and applicability to nurses in recovery today. Despite her humanistic and progressive recommendations to offer nurses immediate treatment, continued employment, and implementing parameters of return to work that supported recovery (i.e., working the day shift, evidence of continued sobriety, etc.), even today we are still trying to consistently provide this support for those in our profession with AUD and SUD. For those nurses who are reported to the state boards of nursing and face disciplinary action related to substance use, the public scrutiny is dehumanizing and shaming. It objectifies people who are fighting a chronic yet treatable disease; a disease that is rooted in biochemical, social, psychological, and spiritual aspects of an individual's life. Taped recordings of boards of nursing meetings, public files of hearings that may include recurrence of substance use, and other open records leave a trail of visual and written discourse about nurses with SUD. Past and current psychological trauma are often underlying themes emerging from the discourse of nurses' experience. These documents and recordings create a discriminatory reality for nurses that discounts the context of AUD and SUD as chronic and treatable diseases. The low enrollments to alternative-to-discipline (ATD) programs may be due to the shame, guilt, humiliation, and self-stigmatization from nurses themselves, impacted by a culture of shame from the nursing profession. It seems as if there are three contexts against nurses who struggle with substances and alcohol: individual/professional/regulatory, organizational, and societal. Today's nurses who enter SUD treatment and recovery still face many barriers, perhaps the most salient being the regulatory aspect of their status within the nursing profession. State boards of nursing are charged with protecting public safety and ensuring the state nurse practice acts are upheld. Nurses who appear before the state boards of nursing are frequently there because of alcohol and substance use, with some nurses facing criminal charges. ATD programs offer a humanistic approach by allowing nurses to come forward and report their dependency, with some protections in preserving their nursing licenses. Most states have ATD programs, which include contracts for SUD recovery monitoring agreements and other stipulations. For many nurses, ATDs provide an alternative to boards of nursing disciplinary actions. Yet, stigma and discrimination, or being unaware of these programs prevent many nurses from using ATDs. In canvasing 15 states making up 66% of nurse licensees, Clark (2021), found surprisingly low numbers of new enrollees in ATD programs. For example, in 2020 only 112 California nurses out of 457,604 licensees had enrolled in the ATD program. Clark (2021) found that across the states surveyed, \"annual enrollment is astonishingly low\" (n.p.). More current findings indicated this is far below the 6.6% of nurses with SUDs (Trinkoff et al., 2022). For those nurses who are on a path of recovery, there may be many barriers to work reentry. Internalized shame related to being a member of a stigmatized group may prevent nurses from returning to nursing work. Externally, financial stressors, the slow pace of boards of nursing decision-making related to status of the nursing license, and difficulty finding employment are also barriers to work reentry for nurses after SUD treatment (Matthias-Anderson & Yurkovich, 2016). Potential employers, especially in large healthcare systems, may eliminate recovering nurses from consideration for employment due to concern for patient safety or fear of litigation. The ease by which prospective employers can access public information about past or current action against the license of a nurse in recovery for SUD makes it easy for employers to eliminate the nurse immediately from consideration. This only increases shame and stigma while decreasing hope for the nurse wishing to return to work. The use of discriminatory hiring practices for nurses in recovery may violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), although the application of the law is not without challenges. According to the United States Commission on Civil Rights (2000), an employer is legally compelled to not discriminate against a person with a history of addiction who is currently participating in a rehabilitation program or who has completed a rehabilitation program provided they are currently substance-free. Accommodations for safe work environments for nurses in recovery should be treated with the same serious consideration as accommodations for an individual with other disabilities. The continued use of language and probing questions regarding mental health and substance use history on licensure and job applications is a legally nebulous territory that likely requires employer guidance and training to ensure compliance with ADA standards. When a nurse being monitored by an ATD program does return to work, operationally this results in additional paperwork for the organization that is employing the nurse. There may be limits on the nursing license and practice restrictions. ATD program involvement may include monitoring requirements, such as daily check-ins and random specimen collections. While such accountability is part of the ATD programs, and some would argue the recovery process itself, supervisors and healthcare systems need to use non-stigmatizing language in their interactions and be willing to work with individuals who are reentering the workforce. During conversations with nurses in recovery, we often hear statements such as \"I never thought it would happen to me\" and \"Nursing is all I've ever wanted to do.\" The love of the work of a nurse brings them back into the organization and supports engagement in the work of recovery. Further, they perceive themselves to be much better nurses while in recovery (Matthias-Anderson & Yurkovich, 2016). Often, ATD monitoring during the tough early recovery period keeps them accountable (Matthias-Anderson & Yurkovich, 2016). Enrollment in ATDs is often during a vulnerable time for nurses with SUD, and the language and behaviors of peers and employers shape the reality of recovery for them. Protection of public health and safety is often cited as the rationale for restrictions around return to work and the long list of regulatory procedures regarding substance use mandatory reporting. The primary function of state regulatory bodies is the protection of public health; the question is whether stigmatizing language, discrimination, and punitive measures for nurses with SUD offer better protection for the public versus an environment focused on well-being, self-discovery, and continuous support through recovery. The vast underuse of ATD programs and minimal utilization of traditional SUD recovery pathways in nursing means that most nurses with AUD and SUD are not receiving help to begin or continue recovery, placing them and the populations they serve at much greater risk than a process that provides monitoring and support. Language around substance use in the nursing profession appears in at least two contradictory spheres. In one sphere nurses may consume substances to cope with the rigors of the professions, as well as being exposed to and having access to pharmacological agents. For example, the normalization of substances is commonplace as a way of managing stress, such as alcohol after a particularly difficult shift, or managing the rigors of bedside nursing with caffeine or energy drinks during long work hours (Ross et al., 2018; Trinkoff et al., 2022). As a part of their professional orientation, nurses are responsible for dispensing a variety of pharmacologic agents designed to mediate the body's functions in a desirable way. In the limited studies completed thus far regarding nurse attitudes toward substance use, the use of legal substances by the individual nurse appears to be well accepted up to the point of an SUD diagnosis (Kunyk et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2018). As a mental exercise regarding the acceptability of casual overuse of substances, the authors recommend thinking about how difficult it might be for a nurse in recovery to attend any outside-of-work social activities with colleagues, such as an after-work happy hour or a \"Margarita breakfast.\" In the other sphere, nurses with SUD who are \"caught\" and confronted by employers are often discussed in terms that create a sense that they are \"others,\" distinctly different from \"us\" (Ross et al., 2018). The transition from casual overuse of substances to full blown addiction is not always apparent to the individual nurse. Further, their support system, coworkers, and often the recognition of a need for intervention occurs only after a sudden event. This may take the form of a driving under the influence (DUI) charge, a suspicion of working while under the influence, or a diversion of substances from the workplace. While the process of developing a SUD can be insidious, the transition from nurse to \"addict\" or \"alcoholic\" is more likely to be sudden, isolating, and stigmatizing. This stark contrast in language is unscientific at best, considering the nature of SUD, which exists along a continuum based on risk to the individual and to society (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). An individual with SUD does not wake up one day with a full-blown problem; rather, SUD develops over time, through continued substance misuse that creates chemical changes in the brain (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). The point at which a nurse changes from a colleague who had \"one too many at happy hour\" to a nurse with a SUD is often based not on the status of a nurse's substance use but rather the status of legal action in their lives, such as whether or not they were pulled over for a DUI infraction on the way home. The line of demarcation between acceptable substance use and the moment at which a nurse is deemed an \"addict\" or \"alcoholic\" can have devastating consequences. For a nurse newly diagnosed with or even simply suspected of SUD, they often must leave their place of employment, surrender, or forfeit their nursing license and means of income, and lose their social relationships. Retrospective studies of nurses who died by suicide show a relationship between substance use investigations at work and the decision to move forward with a suicide plan (Barnes et al., 2022; Davidson et al., 2021). While impossible to isolate a single variable, stigmatizing language and processes are almost certainly a part of the complex process that results in death by suicide for at least some nurses. Curtin (1987) ends her discussion of stigma and nurses' substance use by asking if we can afford to \"throw away\" nurses given that an estimated 18% of nurses in the United States screen positive for substance use problems (Trinkoff et al., 2022). This remains an important question given the crisis of the nursing shortage today, but it is not just about the shortage. We also know that COVID-19 increased US nurses' use of substances, particularly alcohol (American Nurses Association Enterprise, 2020a, 2020b; Foli et al., 2021). Study after study in the nursing literature documents the psychological harm done by the working conditions faced by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet there are psychological traumas encountered daily by nurses, and some of these traumas put nurses at risk for developing substance use problems (Foli, 2022). Given the many challenges individuals with SUD experience, researchers in substance use should receive training in and apply updated and equitable language to reduce stigma. The use of informed and non-stigmatizing language will facilitate trust, so individuals feel safe and free from judgment. In addition, theoretical models may offer a way to organize data collection and analysis. The Socioecological Model (SEM) (Bronfenbrenner, 1994) and Intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1990), are useful frameworks to deepen our understanding of substance use among nurses and different populations. The advantage of using the SEM (Bronfenbrenner, 1994) is that it elucidates how individuals, interpersonal, institutional community-level, and wider societal factors impact behaviors of individuals who have challenges with substance use. Further, Intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1990) as a framework may be useful to understand how intersecting identities of nurses and individuals locate them in more disadvantaged positions for substance use. More specific to nurses, the middle-range theory of nurses' psychological trauma situates substance use as a potential outcome of ongoing and past traumatic experiences (Foli, 2022; Foli et al., 2020, 2021). Finally, additional research is needed to examine potential disparities for equitably accessing and/or receiving substance use treatment that includes individual, professional, and organizational barriers and facilitators. Words, language, and discourse create our reality and as nurses we can choose to use them differently to create a more caring and therapeutic reality. A new ontological self is needed for all individuals in nursing that reflects thoughtful, equitable, and person-centered conduct; such conduct will dismantle pillars that too often support the stigmatization of colleagues and patients. The reality is that at times nurses, like most people, use language to describe others that sometimes cause harm, and this is particularly true with highly stigmatized groups such as people with AUD and SUD. In nursing, these patterns of behavior are harmful not only to our patients, but also to our fellow nurses who may themselves struggle with alcohol and substance use. To shift away from obligation and toward greater respect and dignity, nurses must disentangle their identity as a nurse from patient nonnormative behaviors and conditions. All people who struggle with alcohol and substance use deserve to be treated with kindness, respect, an informed mind and mindful discourse, and provided with resources to support healing and recovery. Our nursing colleagues deserve this too, including accountability without judgment, employment without suspicion, transparency without shame. This must be our charge. This should be our reality.

      "title": "Political issues (Self-Presentation of Political Actors)",
      "abstract": "Political issues, in general, focus on the content of political actors’ communication and most often describe either the main issue or several issues that are in the focus of a political actor’s statement or any other relevant text (e.g., press release, news article, tweet, etc.). The basic premise of analyzing political issues in the self-presentation of political actors is that one major goal of political actors’ communication is to place specific issues on the political agenda (Strömbäck &amp; Esser, 2017). Political issues are most often coded based on a list of pre-defined issues that refer to different policies and sometimes also to polity or politics. The scope and detail of the individual issues depend on the purpose and the focus of the analysis. Field of application/theoretical foundation: Apart from being a common descriptive and control variable, the coding of issues in political actors’ communication can serve as the basis for more complex variables or concepts such as agenda building or issue ownership. Agenda building, at large, refers to the process of how media content is shaped by societal forces (Lang &amp; Lang, 1981). With regard to analyses of politicians’ self-presentation, most work focuses on the processes of communication by which political actors aim to obtain media coverage for their issues (Norris et al., 1999; Seethaler &amp; Melischek, 2019). Analyses on agenda building usually compare issue agendas between at least two different forms of communication, e.g., between channels where political actors have high control (such as press releases, party manifestos, social media messages) and journalistic outlets where political actors have less control (e.g., Harder et al., 2017; Kiousis et al., 2006; Seethaler &amp; Melischek, 2019). Content analyses on agenda building usually start by, first, identifying relevant issue fields and categories (inductively or deductively). Second, the dominant political issues in political actors’ communication and/or other forms of communication (e.g., news articles) are coded according to predefined lists. Third, the occurrence of specific issues or issue agendas are compared between the different forms of communication, often over time (see, e.g., Seethaler &amp; Melischek, 2019). Issue ownership, in broad terms, means that some parties are considered by the public in general as being more adept to deal with, or more attentive to, certain issues (Lachat, 2014; Petrocik, 1996; Walgrave et al., 2015). Traditionally, issue ownership has been analyzed from a demand-side perspective, based on surveys, as the connection between issues and parties in voters’ minds. Definitions of issue ownership usually comprise at least two dimensions: competence issue ownership (parties’ perceived capacity to competently handle or solve a certain issue) and associative issue ownership (the spontaneous link between some parties and some issues) (Walgrave et al., 2015). Content analyses build on these definitions to investigate to what extent political actors focus on issues that they (respectively their parties) own and what factors may explain the (non-)reliance on owned issues (e.g., Dalmus et al., 2017; Peeters et al., 2019). Other content analyses use issue ownership as an independent variable, for example, to explain user reactions to parties’ social media messages (e.g., Staender et al., 2019). Content analyses on issue ownership usually start by, first, identifying relevant issue fields and categories (inductively or deductively). Second, the dominant political issues in political actors’ communication are coded according to predefined lists. Third, political actors are assigned issue ownership for specific issues based on theoretical considerations, existing literature, and/or survey data. Fourth, an index for owned issues is calculated at the statement or text level based on the coded issues and the predefined ownership for specific issues. References/combination with other methods of data collection: Political issues can be analyzed using both manual and automated content analysis (e.g. topic modeling or dictionary approach). Analyses use both inductive or deductive approaches and/or a combination of both to identify issue categories and extend or amend previous lists of political issues. Example studies: Dalmus et al.

      "title": "Strategi peningkatan komunikasi organisasi di pt.radio tomasi lintas cipta suara (prambors Solo) untuk meningkatkan kinerja karyawan",
      "abstract": "Keberhasilan atau kegagalan suatu organisasi pada dasarnya dipengaruhi oleh berbagai macam hal, salah satunya adalah faktor sumber daya manusia. Tidak dapat dipungkiri bahwa sumber daya manusia kini merupakan salah satu komponen yang sangat penting, karena segala aktivitas perusahaan pada dasarnya akan kembali kepada manusia yang terdapat di dalamnya. SDM merupakan aset yang sangat berharga bagi suatu organisasi yang harus senantiasa dikembangkan dan dikelola dengan baik (Handoko, 2001). Dalam sebuah perusahaan yang bergerak dalam industri penyiaran radio, komunikasi organisasi harus terjadi dengan baik dan kondusif. Kondusif disini diartikan adanya saling pengertian dari setiap anggota, terutama proses komunikasi antara semua anggota organisasi, iklim komunikasi, arus komunikasi dan media komunikasi.\r\nKomunikasi organisasi yang terjadi di stasiun radio Prambors Solo khususnya dalam bentuk komunikasi fomal dan informal, cenderung berlebihan pada komunikasi informal yang mengakibatkan hampir tidak ada batasan dalam berkomunikasi terhadap sesama anggota organisasi. Komunikasi informal yang berlebihan pada radio Prambors Solo mengakibatkan ketidaktahuan perbedaan dengan komunikasi formal. Yang seharus dalam konsep komunikasi organisasi antara komunikasi formal dan informal harus berimbang. Dengan tingginya komunikasi informal yang terjadi di radio Prambors Solo, memungkinkan adanya kendala dalam komunikasi formal di radio Prambors Solo. \r\nDalam arah komunikasi organisasi memiliki tiga arah yaitu ke atas, ke bawah dan ke samping yang mencakup komunikasi formal dan informal. Arah komunikasi di radio Prambors Solo berdasarkan pengamatan prapenelitian terdapat kesenjangan atau gap. Timbulnya gap dan distorsi informasi sesama anggota organisasi, karena tidak adanya kesamaan makna dan nilai komunikasi antar anggota, selain itu dari sisi subyektif, misalnya permasalahan like dan dislike terhadap salah satu anggota organisasi dan faktor kemampuan komunikasi personal. Dengan permasalahan seperti itu, maka akan terjadi bias penilaian terhadap kinerja anggota, baik oleh pimpinan dan juga antar sesama anggota unit-unit di perusahaan. \r\nDalam penelitian ini akan melihat komunikasi organisasi di Prambors Solo, misalnya ingin melihat sejauh mana persepsi karyawan radio Prambors Solo mengenai komunikasi organisasi yang ada dilihat dari empat unsur yaitu proses komunikasi, kualitas media komunikasi, pesan dan iklim komunikasi. Dan kesenjangan dalam arah komunikasi formal dan informal yang menyebabkan distorsi informasi. Yang kemudian akan melihat pula apakah komunikasi organisasi, masa kerja dan tingkat pendidikan berpengaruh terhadap kinerja karyawan Prambors Solo. Selain itu, penelitian ini juga yang pada akhirnya akan memberikan rekomendasi strategi kepada Prambors Solo untuk meningkatkan kinerja karyawannya dengan pendekatan komunikasi organisasi.\r\nPengambilan data dalam penelitian ini melalui penyebaran kuesioner untuk mengetahui persepsi karyawan mengenai komunikasi organisasi dan kinerja, kesenjangan (gap) komunikasi organisasi dan pengaruh komunikasi organisasi terhadap kinerja karyawan serta pengaruh tingkat pendidikan dan masa bekerja terhadap kinerja karyawan. Untuk menganalisis Key Success Factors (KSF) dan strategi peningkatan dilakukan dengan Focus Group Discussion (FGD) Analisis data untuk melihat persepsi karyawan melalui skala Likert dan rentang kriteria. Untuk melihat kesenjangan komunikasi organisasi dilakukan dengan metode Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA). Dan untuk melihat pengaruh komunikasi organisasi terhadap kinerja karyawan serta tingkat pendidikan, masa bekerja terhadap kinerja karyawan dengan analisis persamaan regresi sederhana. Dalam penentuan alternatif strategi peningkatan komunikasi organisasi dilakukan analisis SWOT terhadap KSF radio Prambors Solo.\r\nHasil penelitian menunjukkan persepsi karyawan terhadap unsur-unsur komunikasi organsisasi, persepsi responden terhadap komunikasi organisasi secara keseluruhan menunjukkan nilai total rentang (rata-rata) dari semua unsur komunikasi organisasi sebesar 58.8 atau masuk kriteria “Setuju”. Hal ini menandakan bahwa responden menganggap komunikasi organisasi di radio Prambors Solo telah berjalan dengan baik. Dengan kata lain, proses komunikasi, media komunikasi secara formal dan informal serta iklim komunikasi telah berjalan dengan baik dan mendukung pekerjaan-pekerjaan yang ada. Tetapi responden tidak mengetahui secara pasti apakah pesan/informasi yang beredar dan diterima oleh responden telah mengalami pengembangan atau penambahan dari aliran yang dilalui oleh pesan/informasi.\r\nUntuk analisis kesenjangan (gap) berdasarkan dimensinya, dilihat dari tiga dimensi yang ada, yaitu hubungan atasan dengan bawahan, hubungan bawahan dengan atasan dan hubungan dengan rekan kerja, maka dimensi yang memiliki nilai kesenjangan tertinggi adalah dimensi hubungan dengan rekan kerja sebesar -0.98. Dan nilai kesenjangan terkecil adalah dimensi hubungan atasan dengan bawahan sebesar -0.71. Untuk secara keseluruhan nilai kesenjangan komunikasi organisasi memiliki nilai kesenjangan sebesar -0.82. Hal ini menandakan berdasarkan secara atribut atau dimensi komunikasi organisasi masih memiliki nilai negatif. Berarti kinerja komunikasi belum memenuhi harapan komunikasi organisasi yang diinginkan oleh setiap anggota organisasi. Sedangkan menurut analisis diagram Katersius yang terbagi empat kuadran Secara keseluruhan kuadran berdasarkan atribut terbanyak masuk ke kuadran B yaitu delapan atribut dan kuadran D memiliki jumlah atribut paling sedikit yaitu empat atribut. Apabila secara atribut berdasarkan dimensinya, hubungan bawahan dengan atasan paling banyak masuk kuadran A yaitu empat atribut. Untuk kuadran B, atribut dimensi hubungan atasan dengan bawahan memiliki jumlah terbesar yaitu enam atribut. Atribut dimensi hubungan bawahan dengan atasan memiliki jumlah terbanyak dalam kuadran C, yaitu tiga atribut. Sedangkan untuk kuadran D, atribut hubungan atasan dengan bawahan memiliki jumlah terbanyak yaitu tiga atribut. \r\nDalam penelitian ini juga melakukan analisis persamaan regresi, yaitu dan pengaruh komunikasi organisasi, masa kerja dan tingkat pendidikan terhadap kinerja karyawan. Berdasarkan hasil analisis regresi berganda menggunakan program SPSS 13. Hasil analisis adalah bahwa pengaruh komunikasi organisasi, mass kerja dan tingkat pendidikan terhadap kinerja karyawan menunjukkan hasil nilai sebesar 42,3 % yang menandakan variabel komunikasi organisasi, masa kerja dan tingkat pendidikan mampu menerangkan variabel kienrja karyawan sebesar 42.3 %. Untuk uji Anova menunjukkan komunikasi organisasi, masa kerja dan tingkat pendidikan berpengaruh nyata kepada kinerja karyawan dnegan nilai sebesar 0.077 (alpha 10 %). Untuk nilai koefisien dari variabel komunikasi organisasi terhadap kinerja karyawan sebesar 0,350 dan untuk masa kerja serta tingkat pendidikan menunjukkan nilai koefisien masing-masing sebesar 0,060 dan -0,482. berdasarkan nilai koefisiensi dari variabel komunikasi organisasi dan masa kerja menunjukkan bahwa kedua variabel tersebut berpengaruh nyata terhadap kinerja karyawan. Sedangkan untuk variabel tingkat pendidikan tidak berpengaruh nyata terhadap kinerja karyawan, hal ini juga didukung oleh hasil pengamatan di tempat penelitian bahwa karyawan radio Prambors Solo merupakan orang-orang yang berpengalaman di bidangnya, khususnya pada bidang teknis dan non-teknis penyiaran radio.\r\nUntuk mendapatkan strategi peningkatan komunikasi organisasi dilakukan analisis positon audit terhadap Key Success Factors (KSF) komunikasi radio Prambors Solo, yang ditentukan berdasarkan tiga analisis sebelumnya melalui Focus Group Disccusion (FGD). Untuk KSF komunikasi organisasi radio Prambors Solo terdapat lima KSF, yaitu 1) Proses Komunikasi, 2) Komunikasi Pemimpin, 3) Fasilitas Komunikasi, 4) Jaringan Komunikasi Informal dan 5) Pengalaman Bekerja Di Industri Radio. Kemudian dalam position audit dilakukan melalui analisis SWOT yang menghasilkan 20 strategi, yang masing-masing KSF memiliki empat strategi dan menekankan pada WT Strategies.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil analisis penelitian secara keseluruhan maka penelitian memberikan saran-saran kepada manajemen radio Prambors Solo untuk meningkatkan kinerja karyawan. Yaitu, 1) Manajemen radio Prambors Solo perlu memberikan pendidikan dan pelatihan keterampilan komunikasi yang diselaraskan dengan wawasan komunikasi karyawan radio Prambors Solo. 2) Mengontrol dan mengevaluasi jaringan komunikasi formal dan informal melalui kebijakan-kebijakan perusahaan untuk menunjang kinerja karyawan yang pada akhirnya pencapaian tujuan perusahaan. 3) Radio Prambors Solo terutama manajemen melakukan audit komunikasi secara menyeluruh pada setiap elemen-elemen perusahaan yang mempunyai tujuan untuk meningkatkan efektifitas organisasi. Dalam pelaksanaannya dilakukan setiap lima tahun dan hingga tujuh tahun. 4) Memanfaatkan secara optimal forum-forum komunikasi internal dan eksternal, seperti lokakarya, seminar, saresehan, simposium, rapat, briefing, laporan-laporan dan penilaian kinerja untuk pengembangan komunikasi organisasi dan 5) Mengintegrasikan strategi-strategi yang telah dihasilkan dengan sasaran atau objektif perusahaan, khususnya dalam lingkup penyempurnaan kualitas sumber daya manusia radio Prambors Solo.",

      "title": "Vocabularies of social influence: Managing the moral accountability of influencing another",
      "abstract": "While there are many definitions and conceptual accounts of 'persuasion' and other forms of social influence, social scientists lack empirical insight into how and when people actually use terms like 'persuade', 'convince', 'change somebody's mind' - what we call the vocabularies of social influence - in actual social interaction. We collected instances of the spontaneous use of these and other social influence terms (such as 'schmoozing' and 'hoodwinking') in face-to-face and telephone conversations across multiple domestic and institutional settings. The recorded data were transcribed and analysed using discursive psychology and conversation analysis with a focus on the actions accomplished in and through the use of social influence terms. We found that when speakers use 'persuading' - but not 'convincing' or 'changing somebody's mind' - it is in the service of orienting to the moral accountability of influencing others. The specificity with which social actors deploy these terms demonstrates the continued importance of developing our understandings of the meaning of words - especially psychological ones - via their vernacular use by ordinary people in the first instance, rather than have psychologists reify, operationalize, and build an architecture for social psychology without paying attention to what people actually do with the 'psychological thesaurus'.",

      "title": "Best Practice as Skilled Organisational Work",
      "abstract": "The organisational dimension of social work is often neglected in practice literature. While there are notable exceptions (for example, Lymbery Sc Butler, 2004), there is a gap between the realities of organisational life as a social worker and social work practice as presented in the literature. Discussions of organisations or management are not usually integrated with practice examples. Such integration would help social workers develop organisational skills and knowledge that would enable them to carry out their job more effectively. The stereotypical gap between social work theory and practice is in many ways a reflection of this lack of analysis and an insufficient understanding of the organisational realities in which social care staff operate. Furthermore, the common deficit model (Ferguson, 2003) is explicitly or implicitly applied to discussions about the organisational context of social work practice: the employing agencies are 'too bureaucratic', 'too managerialist' and so on. The organisational setting becomes an easy target to criticise, and this can add to the negative burden that social care agencies and employees have to carry with them.",

      "title": "Editorial: Pain and relationships",
      "abstract": "People are social beings. For the most part, at all stages of their life course, people strive to establish relationships, in order to experience social connectedness (a sense of belonging and being 'in relation' with others). Although the relationship between persistent pain and social connectedness is complex and multi-faceted (1) there is good evidence to show that poor social connectedness can amplify pain (2), increases the risk of poor mental health and lower well-being (3)(4)(5), and can result in loneliness (3,6), emotional distress (7), and poorer cognitive function (4). Evidence suggests that psychosocial variables can moderate this negative relationship, such that positivity, resilience and happiness can lessen the experience of pain, even in the face of social isolation (8) and lessen the experience of loneliness (9).Adding to the complexity, pain not only affects the person in pain but also spreads out to affect those with whom they are in a relationship; this impact is often typified as being negative. Pain can impact friendship networks (10), partner relationships (11,12), and intimacy, sexual well-being and sexual expectations in relationships (13,14). Its impact reaches out beyond personal relationships and can affect therapeutic relationships (15).This Research Topic brings together a collection of five papers that individually and collectively explore pain, being 'in relation', and a variety of different personal and professional relationships.Whilst in many healthcare papers the pain status of the author(s) is not revealed, in her paper Wilkinson draws attention to herself as a 'researcher-in-pain'. Considering the ubiquity of persistent pain, it is perhaps surprising that the phenomenon of 'researcher-in-pain' has not been previously foregrounded. Wilkinson proposes that 'researchers-in-pain' can connect in ways that other researchers cannot do, bringing an embodied responsiveness drawing on their lived insights of pain. This creates a sense of shared vulnerability that has the potential to accommodate 'pain-friendly' methods and generate new understandings, inspiring innovative approaches from a position of empathy and understanding.Putting the person in pain at the centre of treatment requires professionals to closely attend to both what is and is not communicated and to reach out and create connection. In their case report Adachi et al. present how they carefully built a relationship of trust and a therapeutic relationship with Akiko, a patient with fibromyalgia, and deep-rooted negative emotions arising from adverse childhood experience. The therapeutic relationship is achieved through giving Akiko the opportunity express her feelings using non-verbal means (using drawing and being able to hold a 'towel baby').The slow, person-centred approach to Akiko and her childhood traumas allowed her to understand her anger and overcome the mistrust and fear engendered by previous unsuccessful medical interventions. By giving attention to the root causes of her pain, Akiko's psychotherapy sessions result her pain being relieved and being able to become a connected and active person in society.In another paper considering the therapeutic relationship, Joslin et al. present findings from a scoping review on the importance of therapeutic alliance during physiotherapy treatment for musculoskeletal pain in children. Therapeutic alliance involves a collaborative relationship, an affective bond and agreement on goals and task. Joslin et al.'s narrative synthesis extends the concept of therapeutic alliance within paediatric rehabilitation by identifying the centrality of disciplinary expertise and the importance of being the child's 'trusted guide' who can help create a route map for their physiotherapy rehabilitation. They argue that when this occurs resilience is built and children are able to equip themselves with long-term management and problem-solving skills.Work by Carter et al. explores how young adults with chronic pain and their partners navigate romantic relationships. They define a romantic relationship as a \"relationship between two people that extends beyond platonic (just good friends) friendship\" (p2), thus widening inclusion of relationships not typically studied in young adults with pain or long-term conditions. The inclusion of partners within this work allows exploration of how dyads navigate their relationship. Whereas previous work has tended to demonstrate negative outcomes, Carter et al. show that despite the challenges and limitations imposed by chronic pain, the relationships of young adults with chronic pain and their partners were characterised more positively, by the ability to be vulnerable with each other, hopefulness and reciprocity.The relationships between sexual satisfaction and persistent pain are intricate and the evidence base is limited by a focus on biological factors and a preponderance of female participants. In Barr et al.'s study they aimed to examine predictors of sexual satisfaction among male and female adults presenting for chronic pain evaluation. Using a biopsychosocial framework the team undertook chart review and administered retrospective questionnaires (self-reported pain severity, anxiety, depression, sexual functioning, perceived social support). Barr et al. report that approximately 1 out of 5 scored within the clinical range of sexual dissatisfaction. Such findings highlight the need for future sexual satisfaction research and clinical screening to adopt a biopsychosocial approach to research and a greater focus is needed to address protective factors related to sexual satisfaction. Gonçalves et al. examine the impact of back pain experienced by 350 adolescents (mean age 12.7 ± 1.6 years) attending a public school in Brazil. Using a cross-sectional design they collected selfreported data on the site of back pain (neck, thoracic and low back) and outcomes. Their results show an important association between thoracic pain and low back pain (but not neck pain) with daily activities (missed school classes and interference in physical activities), seeking healthcare, and medication use among school adolescents. They argue that such impacts indicate the need for strategies to prevent and manage back pain in this age group.The contributions of these five papers extend understanding of a range of different relationshipcentred situations across the lifespan, by prompting reflection on what it is like to be in pain or in-relation with someone in pain, as either a romantic partner, healthcare provider or researcher. Integrating these insights leads to holistic pain management addressing physical, emotional and social elements. The papers explore and reveal the ways in which pain can influence aspects of everyday living as well as indicating how small shifts in practice could be positively influential.",

      "abstract": "Komunikasi lintas budaya Holmes yang berkaitan dengan esensi kesopanan selama dekade belakangan ini menjadi satu acuan ketika masalah kesopanan dipersoalkan. Artinya, secara mutlak kerangka berpikir tersebut bisa dikatakan berlaku secara universal. Namun demikian, hal semacam itu mulai terbantahkan ketika satu fenomena sosial yang terjadi di masyarakat Peroe dijadikan sebagai bahan bandingan. Secara umum, Holmes menyatakan bahwa semakin tinggi kelas sosial seseorang, maka tingkat imperatif cenderung digunakan. Tetapi sebaliknya, hal yang demikian justru tidak berlaku pada prosesi Sorong Serah Aji Krama masyarakat Peroe. Pada fenomena yang dimaksud, tidak terlihat sama sekali penonjolan kelas sosial atas maupun rendah terkait dengan kesantunan. Selain itu, besar pula kemungkinan formula Holmes tadi berlaku terbalik pada fenomena tersebut. Atas dasar asumsi tersebut, dapat disimpulkan bahwa (1) stratifikasi sosial yang dikorelasikan dengan kesantunan dalam prosesi adat di masyarakat Peroe, berbanding terbalik dengan formula yang disajikan Holmes; (2). pada komunikasi lintas kelas, modus imperatif lebih cenderung digunakan kelas sosial tinggi terhadap kelas sosial yang ada di bawahnya, tidak berlaku dalam prosesi adat di masyarakat Peroe.",

      "abstract": "The concepts or social inclusion, participation of mentally disabled persons in social life are highly discussed in Lithuania. But the persons with mental handicaps are often the objects, not the subjects of these discussions. In the research presented in this article the attempt has been made to evaluate the extent and intensity of social participation from the perspective or mentally disabled persons themselves. The interview method has been used to investigate the perceptions of young mentally retarded individuals of these aspects of social life: social activity and the sense of well being, the personal meaning of the participation, the possibilities and the obstacles of participation, the opportunities to decide for themselves the level of participation, the sense of identity, etc. The research revealed, that mentally disabled persons do feel quite active in the social life in their immediate environment, they often feel as the decision-makers in the context of suggested choices, they describe themselves as being quite happy in their daily lives and connect the feeling of happiness mostly with their competences in different kind of activities, the possibilities to use these competences and with the existence of the social network of very close people (family members, friends, etc.). It has been also found that the value of participation is subjectively measured mostly not by the results of such participation, but by the process of participation itself.",

      "abstract": "The social mechanisms that influence the direction of language change operate along the demarcations of networks of communication. Within geographic regions, the focused organizations that individuals participate in structure the lines of communication, and the sociodemographic composition (social ecology) therein limits the options of peers to associate with. Schools have their own social ecology, and attendance at schools can explain language change at a level above social interaction but below the level of community. This study uses acoustic vowel measurements from 132 Europan American speakers in three geographically contiguous cities located in northwestern Wisconsin. Modeling results indicate (1) similar sociogeographic contexts lead to linguistic similarity; (2) dissimilarity in social ecology leads to greater linguistic dissimilarity as the difference between a dyads’ years of birth increases; and (3) net of local sociogeographic context and social ecology, similarity in sex and age leads to linguistic similarity and vice versa. These patterns indicate that local social ecologies further demarcate the lines of communication, thereby structuring the form of language at a level between the micro interactional and the macro level of the speech community.",

      "abstract": "Foreword For children and youth, as citizens in a society, being a part of educational systems means being involved in a community. Through participation in educational systems, there is important learning about the self and others, both for individual development and social solidarity. Individual development and social solidarity are interrelated. These are important values in education at all levels. Individuals are social beings and are necessarily interdependent on others. Nevertheless, individualism and social solidarity are values that sometimes can diverge and come into conflict. These values can be defined and interpreted in various ways. In a time of neo-liberalism, for example, where individual choices and rights are put at the forefront of the societal and educational discourses in many countries it is relevant to raise questions on how issues of solidarity and individualism are interpreted and negotiated in education. What kind of shape and definitions do these concepts take when schools and preschools live under the intense pressures for the accountability of educational outcomes(Biesta, 2009)? Under what conditions can values, such as solidarity and individualism, co-exist and develop in multicultural and globalized societies, without one dominating the other...",

      "title": "Relative Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Discussions of the impact of growing inequality have focused on objective indicators. Focusing on what individuals have or do not have can be misleading without understanding how they subjectively interpret the availability of resources. Relative deprivation (RD) occurs when individuals compare themselves with better-off others and conclude that they do not deserve their disadvantage. These upward comparisons, whether imposed or chosen, can damage people’s emotions, behavior, and even mental and physical health. How people respond to RD depends on whether they (a) experience the disadvantage directed toward them as a unique individual or as a member of a group (e.g., ethnic category, occupation), (b) feel anger or another emotion (e.g., sadness), and (c) view the system (e.g., workplace, nation) as open to change. Mobility interventions (e.g., housing and school vouchers) may have unexpected adverse consequences that direct improvements to the local infrastructure and community do not. Costs of RD (including physical illness) increase if people cannot address perceived inequities effectively. RD explains why simply enumerating resources and opportunities does not fully explain how relative disadvantage produces outcomes ranging from social protest to illness. Insights from psychological science that show how individuals respond to social inequities can inform policies for building communities and improving well-being.",

      "title": "The Ontogenesis of Social Dominance: A Strategy-Based Evolutionary Perspective",
      "abstract": "Social dominance results when members of a social group vary in their ability to acquire resources in the presence of others (i.e., compete). Traditional approaches to social dominance often emphasize coercive behavior, but nonetheless suggest that dominant individuals are socially central (e.g., watched, attractive social partners). These patterns, however, apply to humans only up to a certain age. This apparent discontinuity may give the false impression that social dominance is less relevant to human social organization than it is to animal social organization. This paper reintroduces the ethological concept of social dominance, but reinterprets it from a strategy-based perspective. That is, if social dominance is defined as differential ability to control resources—without reference to how this is done—then children evidently employ different strategies to compete with peers (e.g., coercive and prosocial). Furthermore, the type of strategy children employ and peers' responses to it depend largely on the ages of the children. By adopting a strategy-based approach to social dominance and explicitly incorporating developmental processes and uniquely human capacities, human social dominance patterns appear to be more similar to primate patterns than commonly believed. Implications for social competence, peer relationships, and the development of the self are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In all spheres of life, relationships among public and private organizations are built in order to deal with complex societal problems and to address economic challenges that cannot be dealt with by single organizations. Because of the interdependencies, interorganizational collaboration is essential, yet working across organizational boundaries is far from simple. It involves a multitude of different organizations, each having its own interests, perspectives, and identities while also varying in power and size. Further, the societal problems that are dealt with are often severe. This volume focuses on the relational complexities of interorganizational collaboration, captured by the term dynamics, referring to: (a) the social and psychological processes that occur when organizations and their representatives interact to engage in cross-boundary or collaborative work (e.g., trust and distrust, intergroup stereotyping and conflict, conflict avoidance, inclusion and exclusion of stakeholders, power dynamics), as well as (b) the development of these processes over time, in view of external and internal events and/or as a consequence of deliberate interventions to enhance collaborative success. The perspective put forward is largely psychological and sociological, both in terms of understanding the group and intergroup processes as well as efforts to intervene to develop collaborative relationships, based on action research and an organizational development approach.",

      "abstract": "Acting in the \"best interest\" of another implies taking certain steps or following certain rules so that the person and his or her concrete human community will survive and potentially flourish. The long-term understanding of best interest refers to the balance of benefits and burdens with respect to the ultimate goals or purposes of a community within which an individual is situated; short-term best interest refers to that balance with respect to a specific healthcare decision, without reference to the overall situation. However, considering only short-term best interest is unsatisfactory in the final analysis. Any decision to sacrifice individual preference for communal best interest should include three crucial aspects: (1) The individual must be a willing (or potentially willing, in the case of a child) member of the community, (2) individuals never lose their moral standing in the community, and (3) society can justify failure to accept the autonomous decisions of some individuals only (a) if it is impossible, (b) that failure is necessitated by attempts to meet the needs of other individuals, and (c) that decision is not based on unfair or unjust practices. Applying the concept of best interest to nontherapeutic research on children, one can conclude that the indirect benefit to the child is in his or her best interest only when the long-term benefit to the community, in terms of both survival and flourishing, is adequately considered. In addition, healthcare surrogate decision makers, acting in the best interest of a person who cannot make decisions and has not previously expressed his or her wishes, must take into account the long-term interests of the community.",

Probably no other field of sociological inquiry today is brought, through multiple linkages, to such a close contact with other areas of sociological research. In systems with a capacity for self-production that far exceeds the achievements of any society in the past, the forms of action most distant from reproduction and the maintenance of social order signal processes that involve the system in its entirety: they affect the fundamental orientations of society, the direction of change, the basic moral and political choices. Precisely for this reason, analysis of movements provides insights that point behind the back of the collective actors as empirical facts. By their action that challenges the dominant discourse and mobilizes the creative energies in society, movements force us to reflect on the question of how social action – and perhaps individual action as well – constitutes itself in systems where the available resources over-whelmingly exceed reproductive needs.",

Such \"make-believe\" or \"pretend-play\" has long been of interest to scholars of child development, and a number of theories concerning the role it plays in the child's moral and cognitive maturation have been advanced. Considerably less attention has been paid to the actual structures and practices associated with the activities of make-believe. This is unfortunate given the obvious importance that these play in the everyday lives of children. In an attempt to redress this situation, in this chapter I treat make-believe as a form of social interaction and attempt to describe some of its basic features. As in any other form of social interaction, participants in make-believe orient to it as a normatively organized set of practices – one practice can make another expectable or \"conditionally relevant\" (see Schegloff 1968, 2007b), and if that second action is not done it can be found absent by the participants.",

Although extreme instances of organizational\naggression, most notably workplace homicide, tend to garner the most media\nattention, in reality, most occurrences of aggression in the organizational context are verbal in nature. Among these verbal acts of organizational aggression\nare yelling, insulting, cursing others, talking behind others’ backs, and spreading rumors (Baron & Neuman, 1996; Coombs & Holladay, 2004; Geddes &\nBaron, 1997; Glomb, 2002; Grandey, Dickter, & Sin, 2004).

People negotiate in all areas of social life (in the family, at work, in the street, in shops, in a company, in a political party, between states, etc.) whenever they seek to resolve differences of opinion or to get what they want. Any kind of negotiation starts from a series of basic conditions (the interdependence of the parties engaged in negotiations, the existence of some differences of opinion, the partiesâ€™ joint work to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement). At the same time, any negotiation takes place in a certain setting, bordered by the object of negotiation, its aims and stakes, the place and time of its deployment. Depending on the areas where the process of negotiation appears, one can speak of three general types: the economic negotiation, the political negotiation and the social one. At this level, other classifications can be identified, according to the participants in the negotiations, the parties' interests, the negotiating environment, the time and duration of negotiations and the manner of completion, all in the limits of two extreme poles, the conflict and the cooperation between the parties involved.",

      "title": "ETHICS AND WORKING CULTURE OF THE EMPLOYEES IN THE REGIONAL MUNICIPALITY",
      "abstract": "Research background. Ethics covers various areas of life: personal, public and professional relations. Personal ethics studies the well-being of certain individual and their development methods. Social ethics emphasizes well-being of society, duties of individual persons in the society. In the professional ethics the main attention is paid to the behaviour of the representatives of a special field (Raipa, 2001). Employees working in public sector inevitably stick with ethic and working culture problems. Perhaps even more often than the representatives of other fields because they constantly communicate with people, help them to solve their problems every day, inform people about new products (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2005). When having some contact with employees, people judge the morality and working culture of higher officers and the whole sector according to their behaviour (Chen, 2005). Therefore ethics and working culture of public sector employees should be as high as possible. Ethics is important not only in communication with customers (external environment), it is also important internally in the organization, in the mutual relations between colleagues and staff members (Palidauskaite, 2001). Ethical problems might cause different consequences. Some of them are solved almost unnoticed; the others have strong impact on persons or organizations. Ethical problems might occur and disappear or have a continuous character. The purpose of the work was to disclose the importance of ethics and working culture of the employees in the Klaipėda municipality sector. Object of the work was ethics and working culture of the employees. Methods. In this paper we used analysis of scientific literature, analysis of legislation, questionnaire survey, statistical analysis of the data, graphical modelling, specifying and summarizing, and logical abstraction methods. We also analysed scientific and practical materials of national and foreign authors (Raipa, 2001; Palidauskaitė, 2001; Chen, 2005; Fassin, 2005). In order to disclose the importance of ethics and working culture of the employees we chose municipality of Klaipeda region for the research. Conclusions. Organizations are unlikely to have just a single overarching culture. Instead, multiple cultures or subcultures are often present. Organizational cultures are shared experiences resulting from both low-and high profile successes and failures, patterns of conduct, and selfregulating practices. Ethics and working culture in the work of public sector are nonetheless important than in the work of other professions because they have to communicate with people every day. Work culture change is a process of giving and taking by all members of an organization. Formalizing strategic direction, systems development, and establishing measurements must be owned by the group responsible for them. Conflicts in the work of public sector are the negative appearance because of their negative impact on the person itself and the people around - customers, colleagues. It has a negative impact on the efficiency of work, communication, working atmosphere. The employees of Klaipeda municipality who participated in the survey agreed with the opinion that the standards of ethics applicable to the public officers are stricter than those applied to ordinary citizens and also the proper image of the employee helps to support public confidence in service. Keywords: working culture, ethics, employees, public sector.",

      "abstract": "The last 20 years have seen dramatic changes in the social response to conflicts that often appear in urban public space, straddling the line between madness and dangerousness. Among these changes are the appearance of poorly defined problems, responses by new categories of professionals, and new intervention strategies developed in the heat of the action. Intervention to deal with 'boundary' problems crosses fields of expertise, normative frameworks, and symbolic universes, as witnessed by the numerous hybrid classifications for disorders (eg, the antisocial personality, in which correctional and psychiatric aspects are intertwined); 'catch-all' psycho-social nomenclature (social maladjustment; social dysfunction; lack of cognitive, behavioural or emotional skills, etc) (Otero, 2000, 2003); and even collective urban representations of risk (the homeless former psychiatric patient, the junkie, the street kid, etc).",

      "abstract": "Theories on play have not only been interrelated with the notion of everyday practice, but also with child development, fate, power, identity, imagination, game play, and art (Sutton-Smith). Recently, it has been suggested that creative production is an integral and active part of play activities (Pearce), particularly when play connects individuals through collaboration with others who are normally outside of one’s own social network (Nardi and Harris). Studies on virtual role-playing games have shown that playing can become a daily activity, a way of socializing through the formation of “familiar-stranger” relationships, where players enjoy the presence of others in a game but do not necessarily interact with them – something like a person reading by herself in a crowded coffee house (Duchenaut et al.). While play provides the possibility to create spaces that are imaginative and escape certain limitations that one might encounter in the constraints imposed by a pre-constructed environment (Sutton-Smith, Turkle), I do not consider play as separate from these limitations and constraints, but rather as an integral part providing the possibility to challenge physical or cognitive constraints through crossing the boundaries between tangible and imaginative spaces (e.g. a physical and a virtual world).",

A partir de un creciente interés por abordar el tema de la comunicación desde diferentes ópticas disciplinarias, aparecen nuevas reflexiones sobre la complejidad que encierra el fenómeno de la comunicación. Lo que resulta interesante es que la historia de los pueblos se sigue construyendo a pesar de las dificultades que implica la comunicación entre las personas, sobre todo si se entiende que lafinalidad de la comunicación es lograr el entendimiento entre las comunidades y las organizaciones, pues es evidente que tal entendimiento no siempre se logra. Sin embargo, hay algo que moviliza la necesidad de alcanzar el mejor resultado. Ligado a la naturaleza de la comunicaciónno solo están los problemas interpersonales, además se suman los problemas entre grupos, comunidades y organizaciones que, al perseguir intereses en ocasiones contradictorios, pretenden transformar ocultando los conocimientos o experiencias de la minoría. El presente número es el resultado de la suma de investigaciones con carácter metodológico, sin embargo, hay saberes que quedan ocultos por las luchas, por experiencias enterradas que no lograron subsistir. Quizá la misma palabra comunicación implique la no comunicación, la imposibilidadde incluir las experiencias pasadas, la no incorporación de saberes que resultabanincómodos o incompatibles con determinada línea de pensamiento. Habría que empezar por añadir a la pregunta que interroga por la naturaleza de la comunicación, no solo las condiciones para que se produzca este fenómeno, sino además las estrategias por las que determinado tipo de saber sobresale en los ejercicios comunicativos, mientras que otros conocimientos y experiencias se ven desplazados y condenados al sepultamiento.",

      "title": "The Emotions of Failure in Organizational Life",
      "abstract": "Purpose: The emotions that accompany failure, in and of organizations, and their consequences have been researched in multiple domains of management, but comparative approaches have seldom been attempted. The failure of organizations to survive has been a common occurrence over centuries, particularly in the modern era of start-ups, innovation, and political, economic, and environmental turbulence. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, failure at many levels of society, including the organizational and individual, has increased significantly and produced even more intense emotions. Study Design/Methodology/Approach: For this conceptual chapter, literature from many disciplines was consulted on failure in organizations, and the emotions it elicit, including studies on the process of failure as well as its outcomes. Findings: Failing and failure are likely to evoke negative emotions, with negative consequences for the actor. However, positive emotions can also occur, and a matrix of emotional valence and consequences presents an intriguing set of possibilities. The dimensions of emotions (valence, intensity, duration, and frequency) interact with a wide range of contributing factors (salience, personality, identity, emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, prior experience of failure, and context) in producing the emotions of failure and their consequences. Originality/Value: This chapter contributes to the literature by explicating the types of emotions that emanate during and after failure across many domains of management research, their dimensions and contributing factors, and the consequences for the individual actor. The model of the emotions of failure that is presented here assembles a wider variety of elements than prior research has offered. We indicate avenues for further research as we approach an era of even more demanding challenges.",

      "abstract": "In contemporary society, although many adolescents with disabilities are making social integration efforts, many of them are unemployed. Unemployment officially and open refers to direct exclusion from the labor market, but there is also a phenomenon of exclusion inside the labor market. Some groups are involved in segments where jobs are uncertain, poorly paid and do not require special or specialized training. Labor market segmentation tends to be built around immediately identifiable groups (eg by age, ethnicity, gender), so that the exclusion of the \"decency\" is doubled, associated with other forms of social exclusion. It is necessary to improve social policies in the field of disabled people and the strengthening of strategies in the development process of institutionalization of disabled adults.",

On the one hand, there are the organizations, on the other hand, the public, but their motives are quite different. Corporations as structured systems have to integrate themselves and to interact with neighboring systems. They do that by using different sign systems: verbal, paraverbal, nonverbal and extraverbal signs. Different aspects of corporate communication have been described mainly in business management and lately in communications theory, but in linguistics this complex theme has not been explored systematically.

      "abstract": "Research on mobile collocated interactions has been exploring situations where collocated users engage in collaborative activities using their personal mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets), thus going from personal/individual toward shared/multiuser experiences and interactions. The proliferation of ever-smaller computers that can be worn on our wrists (e.g., Apple Watch) and other parts of the body (e.g., Google Glass), have expanded the possibilities and increased the complexity of interaction in what we term mobile collocated situations. Research on F-formations (or facing formations) has been conducted in traditional settings (e.g., home, office, parties) where the context and the presence of physical elements (e.g., furniture) can strongly influence the way people socially interact with each other. While we may be aware of how people arrange themselves spatially and interact with each other at a dinner table, in a classroom, or at a waiting room in a hospital, there are other less-structured, dynamic, and larger-scale spaces that present different types of challenges and opportunities for technology to enrich how people experience these (semi-) public spaces. In this article, the authors explore proxemic mobile collocated interactions by looking at F-formations in the wild. They discuss recent efforts to observe how people socially interact in dynamic, unstructured, non-traditional settings. The authors also report the results of exploratory F-formation observations conducted in the wild (i.e., tourist attraction).",

      "title": "Organizational Culture and Schools: A Call for Leadership and Collaboration",
      "abstract": "The organizational culture of schools is often taken for granted, but it is a subject that needs greater focus and understanding of school-based professionals. In general, organizational culture \"refers to a set of common values, attitudes, beliefs and norms, some of which are explicit and some of which are not\" (Brown, 2004, p. 4). In many ways organizational culture is invisible—although it can be both conscious and unconscious—but at the same time, it serves as the glue that binds and builds a sense of cohesion within schools. Organizational culture can be found in shared relationships among colleagues, norms within the school environment, student and teacher relations, and sharing experiences (Haberman, 2013). A school's organizational culture provides a sense of identity, promotes achievement orientation, helps shape standards and patterns of behavior, creates distinct ways of doing things, and determines direction for future growth. Organizational or school culture has both positive and negative functions. Positive school culture is conducive to professional satisfaction, effectiveness, morale, and creating an environment that maximizes student learning and fosters collegiality and collaboration (Glossary of Education Reform, 2013). Moreover, to garner a positive school culture administration, teachers and staff must engage in healthy behaviors; promote collaborative decision making with input from students, staff, and parents; display high professional standards; and consistently hold students to high standards, with a majority of students meeting such standards. Converging this set of issues within the dynamics of a school setting requires leadership, teamwork, and attention to goal orientation that help shape organization culture in schools (Bush, 2015).",

      "abstract": "Among the many notions that have been disrupted, changed or altogether put into question by the spread of global media, global social networks, and global sources of information is the notion of 'culture'. While twenty years ago, culture could still be defined as 'membership in a discourse community that shares a common social space and history, and common imaginings' (Kramsch 1998: 10), today's mobility and the proliferation of online and offline contact zones have multiplied the number of discourse communities that an individual may belong to and share a common social space with. Culture today would better be seen as meaning making practices mediated by symbolic systems of various kinds across various social and historical contexts and through various communication technologies. Intercultural communication is no longer communication across national borders, but participation in fluctuating networks of individual experiences, memories, and fantasies, multiple allegiances and legitimations, that are expressed and shared mostly, though not exclusively, through language.",

However, little is known about the social participation of frail older adults. This research examined the types of social interaction of very frail older adults and the factors influencing this participation. Method Interviews with 38 very frail older adults were analyzed using Levasseur and colleagues’ (Levasseur, Richard, Gauvin, &amp; Raymond (2010). Inventory and analysis of definitions of social participation found in the aging literature: Proposed taxonomy of social activities. Social Science and Medicine (1982), 71, 2141–2149) taxonomy activity levels of involvement with others. A qualitative hybrid approach with inductive and deductive thematic analyses was used. Results Participants often disengaged from activities with high involvement with others, preferring activities with less involvement. Low-key participation emerged as an important type of social participation enabling frail older adults to remain engaged in society. Key factors that influenced social participation were functional decline, and the physical (e.g., traffic, the disappearance of local stores) and social environment (e.g., social networks and the presence of meeting places such as community centers). Discussion Findings advance our knowledge and recognition of the different ways frail older adults participate in society. Despite their frailty, older adults wish to stay socially active. Focusing on the social environment in the frameworks and policies of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities will benefit these individuals.",

Multitudinous objectives and professional norms, diversity in stakeholder expectations, interests and goals as well as varying structural conditions bring complexity, uncertainty, and fickleness to organizations. By defining what and who they are, by making decisions and performing different activities, organizations must find ways of dealing with circumstances stemming from different forms of generality, producing tensions and more or less precarious compromises (Jagd, 2011). In these contexts, communication plays a crucial role, allowing decisions and activities to be enacted and represented in public. To an increasing degree, much of what we know about organizational activities is based on second-hand information. In most fields, they are primarily mediated either by news media, environmental organizations, customers and other stakeholders, or by organizations’ own communication work (Pallas, Strannegard, & Jonsson, 2014).",

Few as pects of social work practice unfold with out evidence of conflict, competition, or rivalry between individuals, groups, organi zations, and/or institutions. Such is pervasive in community life. Its very uni versality suggests that is a property of social organization.1 Quincy Wright, a careful student of the subject, suggests that conflict in some form ... is probably an essential and desirable element of human society. A society cannot exist without competition and conflict.2 While little empirical evidence is re corded on the subject, one has the impres sion that social workers frequently find themselves involved in interpersonal and intraorganizational disputes, that social agencies are frequently in competition and with one another, and that social agency participants and adherents are fre quently pitted against other institutions in the community, competing for scarce re sources and attempting, through a variety of patterns of organization and action, to affect changes in their modes of operation and service delivery. One might have ex pected that this general circumstance would have led the profession to a careful study of the processes of social and, con sequently, to the development of insight and skill in dealing with them.

In fact, before accessing social assistance resources and programmes and in order to activate the opportunities available in the area for confronting and satisfying basic needs, the interviewee is included in the informal networks of the street people. The very awareness of a service which provides resources, the image which the service has, its accessibility, the relevance which the service is perceived to have to the individuals' problems, and the social value of the resources, are determined by the communication network within which the needy individuals interact. Both Bologna and Barcelona differ greatly from Stockholm, where social assistance is exclusively provided by public agencies that control the allocation of different welfare provisions.",

      "abstract": "Like most periods of the life course, friendships during later life involve both continuities and discontinuities with earlier patterns for individuals and social cohorts. Diverse friendship practices and experiences are apparent for several reasons. First, this developmental period potentially spans 40 or more years of human activity, with individuals exhibiting various opportunities, personal styles, decisions, and initiatives in conducting their social lives. Meanwhile, areas of diminishing or minimal individual control, such as persons' financial resources, social capabilities, health, and mobility, as well as their friends' proximity, abilities to interact, or mortality become salient at varying junctures. To a considerable degree, continuities in friendship practices reflect stability in the participants' capacities for interpersonal contact and enabling circumstances, whereas discontinuities arise from changes in these conditions, which frequently transcend individual choice (Rawlins, 1992; Roberto, 1997).",

In order to understand interpersonal communication in an intercultural context one has to understand how meaning is negotiated when the interlocutors are members of different ethnolinguistic groups; how language interacts with processes of social-cognition mediation; and thus how language may become a salient dimension of this interaction (Gudykunst, 1986). In intercultural communication people interact with one another both as individuals and as members of different social groups; social encounters are thus determined by interpersonal as well as by intergroup factors (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), and can be analysed along these two dimensions (Stephenson, 1981).",

      "abstract": "The research material included about 300 episodes from 30 published sources. A targeted selection was made according to a combination of three criteria: a diversity of social positions among the authors, the biographies of the authors, and the detail of description. An analysis of the material was conducted in order to contribute to a better understanding of the social significance of hospitality. Theoretical assumptions about hospitality in conditions of stability and social crisis were advanced. The analysis showed that in times of relative stability, hospitality was biographically important when it allowed a person to transition between positions in the social structure (usually between close levels) and involved some form of promotion. On the other hand, in conditions of intensified change and crises, the order was disturbed: on the one hand, visits to the homes of persons occupying more distant positions in the hierarchy (both up and down the social ladder) became more common, but on the other hand, there could be a challenge to or rejection of traditional requirements of hospitality. The first situation occurs especially at the beginning of a crisis, and with the depletion of resources, the increase in the number of negative experiences, and socialization to a long-term threat, a survival strategy begins to take shape in which only the closest circles prevail. Such findings suggest that a more cautious look should be taken at both the theoretical concepts in which hospitality is considered a useful social invention especially in times of increased need and at the Polish self-stereotype as a nation with a culture based on hospitality, invariable generosity, and an inclination to selflessness.",

If, because of our manner or our lack of understanding of group-related differences, we cannot establish a relation which gives satisfaction to our patient, and especially in paediatrics, to his family, then however efficient in other techniques, we cannot give good medical care in the fullest sense. The skill required to establish and maintain these relationships is based on a knowledge of the psychological and social factors underlying the behaviour of people including, of course, the physician himself (Saunders, 1954). With patients from our own social milieu or cultural environment, rapport can be easy and much can often be taken for granted; but with patients who are immigrants or on a social class level different from our own, there must be a conscious effort to learn and to understand; they too have to learn about us, but this will be a much more gradual process because they start at such a disadvantage.",

In addition to these needs, familial background, school, and technical qualities of artworks serve as antecedents to artwork consumption.

Kegiatan-kegiatan yang dilakukan difable netra mampu menjadi awal yang baik untuk melihat dan memulai bagaimana interaksi sosial difable netra. Interaksi difable netra dipengaruhi oleh beberapa faktor yaitu pentingnya pemaknaan terhadap perilaku manusia, pentingnya pengaturan diri, dan hubungan antara individu dan masyarakat. Penelitian ini ialah studi lapangan (field research) dengan menggunakan analisis deskriptif dan pendekatan kualitatif. Metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah wawancara, observasi dan dokumentasi. Hasil dari riset ini adalah bahwa pandangan masyarakat terhadap difable (netra) mulai ada pergeseran makna ke arah positif. Hal demikian harus terus dikembangkan oleh berbagai pihak keluarga, masyarakat dan pemerintah untuk memberikan fasilitas-fasilitas yang dibutuhkan oleh difable netra. Dapat disimpulkan yaitu fenomena sosial yang sering terjadi di sekitar lingkungan masyarakat terhadap kemampuan yang berbeda pada diri seseorang sering dikaitkan dengan keterbatasan, kekurangan bahkan menjadikan bahan olok-olokkan sehingga membuat ruang gerak mereka menjadi penghalang dan terbatas dalam bergaul dan berinteraksi dengan lingkungannya.

      "title": "Role of Personality and Spirituality in Nonviolent Behavior in Young Adults",
      "abstract": "A substantial amount of research within psychology has focused on the topics of violence and aggression. Unfortunately, nonviolence, an interrelated but more positively focused topic has not received much attention. Mayton, (2009) describes nonviolence as not merely the absence of violence rather as a pattern of thoughts, attitudes and behavior with six basic characteristics. These characteristics include (1) beliefs that both physical and psychological violence are to be avoided, (2) active search for wisdom and desire to find out the truth rather to humiliate the opponent, (3) willingness to endure hardship for the comfort of others (4) having helping and emphatic behavior for others, (5) effort to increase social justice without using violence, (6) no cooperation with evil.Nonviolence occurs at the intrapersonal level, interpersonal level, societal level, or world level. At the societal level and world levels the basic components of peaceful or nonviolent cultures include social justice, protection of human rights, gender equity, education, inclusiveness, rule of law and environmental . At the intrapersonal level and interpersonal levels the traits of agreeableness, empathy, anger control, cooperativeness, need for cognition, forgivingness, moral reasoning and spirituality are relevant, along with higher priority on the value of benevolence and lower priorities on power and hedonism values (Mayton, 2009). Brown (1989) describes intrapersonal nonviolence as essential for interpersonal and societal peace. The real peace is the intrapersonal peace, while interpersonal and societal peace is the reflection of this. Other two levels of peace can't be achieved until the intrapersonal peace is achieved. Therefore the current study focused on assessing how different dimensions of personality and spirituality relate to nonviolent behavior at intrapersonal level.Numerous theories or models of personality have been presented over the past centuries, each theory or model presented personality in a different way. This study makes use of the five factor model of personality (McCrae & Costa, 1999) to investigate the role of personality traits in nonviolent behavior. The big five or the five-factor model of personality pinpoints five main traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) that underlie an individual's personality and play an important role in shaping the individual's behavior (Piedmont, 1998 ). A small number of studies have been conducted to assess the relationship of personality traits with nonviolent behavior (Mayton, 2009). Only three studies investigated the relationship between big five personality traits and nonviolent behavior. Mayton et al (2008) investigated the relationship between personality traits and nonviolent behavior in US college students. Agreeableness was found to be positively related to psychological nonviolence, helping behavior, search for wisdom and self-suffering dimensions of nonviolent behavior. Extraversion was found to be positively related to physical nonviolence, psychological nonviolence, helping/empathy and search for wisdom dimensions of nonviolent behavior. Conscientiousness was found to be positively related to helping behavior and negatively related to physical nonviolence and psychological nonviolence. Openness to experience was not found to be related to any dimension of nonviolent behavior. Heuchert (as cited in Mayton, 2009) investigated the relationship of big five personality traits to nonviolent behavior in undergraduate students in U.S.A. it was found that people who scored high on agreeableness also scored high on psychological nonviolence, helping/empathy and self-suffering dimensions of nonviolent behavior. It was also found that people who scored high on conscientiousness also scored high on all the dimensions of nonviolent behavior. The relationship with three other personality traits (neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experience) was not found significant. …",

      "title": "Inconsistency between Communities and Opinion Formation",
      "abstract": "It is often the case that a single person belongs to multiple communities and expresses different opinions by community. However, the lack of consistency of his opinions is subject to criticism when they are uncovered. Recently, opinion formation mainly occurs in online communities instead of real communities and this affects the opinion formation environment as follows: 1) the inconsistency of opinions is easily disclosed because many online communities are not closed, and 2) there are some people too sensitive to such inconsistency. These become social pressures making people rather silent in communities and cause many phenomena including silent majority/vocal minority and opinion polarization. It is important to clarify how these changes affect opinion formation processes. Our goal is to reveal the dynamics of opinion formation in multiple communities, considering the dilemma of people between the adaptation to each of communities and the lack of consistency. We make an agent based model based on the Bounded Confidence Model on multiplex network structures. The model is novel in considering conflict between agent's different opinions across multiple communities. As a result of simulation, it is found that probability of disclosure of the lack of consistency could cause opinion formation processes differently by how agents are sensitive to the lack of consistency. Only when agents do not overreact to the lack of consistency, the larger the probability of disclosure is, the smaller the variation of opinions within communities becomes. On the other hand, when agents overreact to the lack of consistency, the mechanism of opinion formation is different. Furthermore, we reveal the mechanism of the influence of social pressure to the opinion formation processes. These results can explain real world phenomena and offer suggestions for the facilitation of consensus formation in the age of Internet.",

      "title": "GLI ELEMENTI CHIAVE DELLA SOCIALIZZAZIONE LAVORATIVA NELLA DISABILITÀ",
      "abstract": "This contribution aims to deepen the declination of the work socialization processes of people with disabilities. The very idea that the disabled individual is able to work is certainly the result of the change in social and economic conditions over time, but also of the demands that the movements of disabled people have brought forward in recent years. aims to deepen the declination of the working processes of people with disabilities. The success of the socialization process is the main indicator of the possibility of a successful outcome of the subsequent stay of the worker in the company. Employees who are socially accepted by their colleagues can get to work at higher levels, precisely because they are helped by the relationships they have established (Bauer et al .; 2007). In summary, the norm of being kind has implications that concern all phases of the socialization process, the reluctance to provide the newcomer with negative information regarding the organizational reality, the rules, its performance or the congruence between its values and those of the organization definitely hinders the whole process, also because it can provoke in the new arrivals the illusion of having been accepted, when instead, in reality, they are not (Colella, 1997). The elements that prevent a normal socialization path for disabled people concern both the size of expectations (both of disabled people and colleagues) and the quality of interactions. An important contribution to the realization of the new professional subjectivity of young people with disabilities can be given by the exploration of the perception of employability, where up to now this construct has not been explored in relation to people with disabilities and most studies have focused attention on the attitudes of employers and colleagues rather than on the point of view of people with disabilities. (Schein, 2004; Kirsh, 2005; Shur et al, 2005; Reichers, 1990; Ball et al, 2005; Sandler, Blanck, 2005; Stone, Colella, 1996; Burke-Miler et al, 2006; Ren et al, 208 ; Smith, Twomey, 2003) Il presente contribuo mira ad approfondire  la declinazione I processi di socializzazione lavorativa delle persone in condizione di disabilita.  L’idea stessa che l’individuo disabile sia in grado di lavorare e certamente frutto in questo senso del mutamento delle condizioni sociali ed economiche avvenuto nel corso del tempo, ma anche delle rivendicazioni che i movimenti delle persone disabili hanno portato avanti in anni recentpresente lavoro mira ad approfondire la declinazione dei processi lavorativi delle persone in condizione di disabilita. Il successo del processo di socializzazione e il principale indicatore della possibilita di un buon esito della permanenza successiva del lavoratore in azienda. I dipendenti che sono socialmente accettati dai loro colleghi possono arrivare a lavorare a livelli piu elevati, proprio perche vengono aiutati dalle relazioni che hanno stabilito (Bauer et al.; 2007). In sintesi, la norma di essere gentili ha implicazioni che riguardano tutte le fasi del processo di socializzazione, la riluttanza a fornire al nuovo arrivato informazioni negative riguardanti la realta organizzativa, le regole, la sua prestazione o la congruenza tra i propri valori e quelli dell'organizzazione ostacola decisamente tutto il processo, anche perche puo provocare nei nuovi arrivati l’illusione di essere stati accettati, quando invece, in realta, non lo sono (Colella, 1997). Gli  elementi che impediscono un “normale” percorso di socializzazione per le persone disabili riguardano sia la dimensione delle aspettative (sia dei soggetti disabili che dei colleghi) che la qualita delle interazioni . Un contributo rilevante alla realizzazione della nuova soggettivita professionale dei giovani in condizione di disabilita puo essere dato dall’esplorazione della percezione dell’occupabilita, laddove sino a questo momento tale costrutto  non e stato esplorato in relazione alle persone in condizione di disabilita e la  maggior parte degli studi hanno posto l’ attenzione sugli atteggiamenti dei datori di  lavoro e dei colleghi piuttosto che sul punto di vista delle persone in condizione di disabilita.",

      "abstract": "The nature of problems experienced by social workers’ clients has often challenged social workers to collaborate with other organisations (Patel, Hochfeld, &amp; Selipsky, 2008). The concept of collaboration holds much promise, yet this delicate and complex process presents numerous risks of failure, threatening both the process of collaboration and the outcomes being sought. There are many barriers to inter-organisational collaboration. Consequently, there is a need for applicable knowledge and skills in the direct practice of partnership development in social development (Lombard &amp; Van Rensburg, 2001) – inter-organisational collaboration being one form of partnership development. This report explores and describes the concept of inter-organisational collaboration as a social service delivery strategy as very few guidelines exist that could assist in the planning and managing of collaborative partnerships ensuring that it achieves its intended aims and goals of delivering quality social services (Lombard &amp; Van Rensburg, 2001). A relevant theoretical perspective as presented here should inform the process of developing practice guidelines in collaborative approaches.",

In the current study, adult adoptees (n = 25) were interviewed about their processes for disclosing their adoptive status in their social networks. Drawing upon communication privacy management (CPM) theory, inductive analyses demonstrated that adoptees created motivational and contextual criteria to enact privacy rules surrounding adoption. Adoptees maintained privacy to avoid messages of \"difference,\" insensitive comments, imperviousness, and negative opinions about adoption. Adoptees disclosed about their adoption to build relational closeness and to educate/advocate for adoption. These privacy decisions were undergirded by the societal assumption that families are biologically linked or the discourse of biological normativity (Suter et al., 2014).",

      "title": "Communication Management for Public Service Broadcasting – An Analysis of the Legitimizing Rhetoric of PSB in Switzerland",
      "abstract": "With the technological, political, and societal developments in the European broadcasting ecology, more and more commercial survival strategies, and the ‘failure’ to demonstrate societal value, the acceptance of public funded broadcasting decreases. In addition, media content as experience and credence good makes the demonstration of quality hardly possible. Therefore, this project draws the attention to communication management. It is guided by the question, How can public service broadcasters communicatively maintain and regain legitimacy in the digital era? Acting on the assumption that organizations are embedded in a complex environment that strongly determines organizational action (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977), we see changes in the organizational environment, such as changes in media policy and media market structures, social upheaval, or technological innovations, as legitimacy threats for PSB organizations. As a response to perceived legitimacy threats, organizations respond with different legitimation strategies (Suchman, 1995). These strategies, manifested in observable behavior and communication, in turn influence organizational stakeholders’ individual perceptions, judgments, and actions – in conditions of institutional change in particular (Bitektine & Haack, 2015). Different rhetorical strategies can be used to support or promote stakeholders’ favorable individual-level legitimacy attributions (Bitektine & Haack, 2015). Tangible in the form of mission statements, guiding principles, annual reports, or other organizational documents, communicative strategies become accessible for systematic analysis. Following Suchman (1995), who sees legitimacy management as resting heavily on communication, we are therefore examining the communicative strategies of the Swiss PSB organization SRG SSR with qualitative content analysis. In addition to topics and actors, the codebook includes van Leeuwen’s (2007) categories of legitimation, including dimensions of (a) authorization, (b) moral evaluation, and (c) rationalization. In the case of public service broadcasting organizations, Suddaby and Greenwood’s (2005) ‘Theorizations of change’ give additional understanding of the legitimation strategies used during times of institutional instability. This typology includes five such theorizations of change: teleological, historical, cosmological, ontological, and value-based strategies. General crisis strategies, i.e., “evasive”, “defensive”, “appreciative”, or “accommodative” are also be included in the codebook. According to Bitektine and Haack (2015) the organizations’ rhetorical legitimation strategies influence legitimacy perceptions and judgments especially under the condition of institutional change. Dealing with legitimacy-enhancing communication is thus highly relevant for public service broadcasters. As the case of Switzerland is very special due to its market size, political system, multilingualism, and current hot debate over the “service public” in PSB, results provide insights into a special case but serve as starting point for comparative research. With our study we develop a multilevel model for legitimacy management for PSB – derived from institutional theory, strategic management, and social psychology­ – and complement the research on communicative legitimation strategies of PSB (Larsen, 2014; Spicer & Fleming, 2007) by a more comprehensive analysis of different corporate documents, using a broader approach to rhetorical, narrative, and discursive strategies. The proposed paper and presentation will focus on the empirical findings and therefore contribute to the knowledge of communication management of PSB organizations and successful legitimacy management of public service broadcasting organizations in the future.

      "title": "Social projection of belongingness needs",
      "abstract": "People are motivated to create relationships with one another. Strangers approach each other at parties, people join online networking sites, and others join other social groups (e.g., churches, clubs, fraternal organizations) with the hope of forming social connection with others. This motivation to form social bonds stems from innate belongingness needs (Baumeister & Leary, 1995) and this desire for social connection has been shown to be a powerful determinant of much of human thought and behavior (see Leary, 2010 for review). There are many ways by which people can regulate their belongingness needs. In an effort to form social relationships (and thus satisfy belongingness needs), people become attentive to signs of social acceptance (DeWall, Maner, & Rouby, 2009), express a great interest in forming relationships (Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, & Schaller, 2007), and monitor their social environment for relationship opportunities (Gardner, Pickett, & Brewer, 2000). In a similarly adaptive fashion, people may also construe potential relationship partners in a manner that facilitates social connection. That is, people especially motivated to satisfy belongingness needs may think that others share a similar interest as themselves in forming relationships. The current research addresses this functional approach to perceiving others as similar as ones' self as a means of regulating one's own belongingness needs. At first glance, the literature paints a disheartening picture of the individual with unmet belongingness needs. Several studies have demonstrated relationships between a lack of social connection and an array of negative physical and psychological health outcomes (see Pickett, Gardner, and Knowles, 2004, Twenge, Catonese, & Baumeister, 2003, Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000). Equally as dejecting, numerous studies have shown that thwarted belongingness needs, via social rejection, lead to increases in aggressive behavior (see Baumeister, Brewer, Tice, & Twenge, 2007 for a review). However, a negative portrait of the individual with unmet belonging needs conveys only half of the story. A lack of social connectedness can also evoke more inclusive-driven thoughts and promote more socially adaptive behavior (DeWall, Maner, & Rouby, 2009; Lakin & Chartrand, 2003). Although people who experience social rejection view instigators of their rejection negatively and aggress towards them, they also view new interaction partners more positively (Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, & Schaller, 2007). In regards to novel social targets, those who experience social rejection report more favorable impressions and express a greater interest in establishing a future relationship than those who are not previously rejected. It appears that favorable attitudes towards novel social targets may be one of the preliminary steps necessary for social connection and the satisfaction of belongingness needs (Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, & Schaller, 2007). Other research has shown that belongingness needs play a pivotal role in shaping the way in which rejected individuals perceive their social world. Both chronically high belongingness needs and temporary feelings of rejection have been shown to create a greater attentiveness to, and memory for, socially relevant cues within one's environment (Gardner, Pickett & Brewer, 2000; see Pickett & Gardner, 2005 for a review; Pickett, Gardner, & Knowles, 2004). A heightened awareness for social information is a highly functional means of monitoring one's environment for inclusion opportunities as well as avoiding situations where exclusion is likely. This engaged social monitoring allows the individual with unmet belongingness needs either to approach inclusionary situations or avoid situations indicative of social rejection (Pickett & Gardner, 2005). It is adaptive for people motivated to form relationships to notice subtle inclusionary cues (e. …",

      "title": "The role of social work in the context of social disintegration and violence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Violence and the violence discourse are very similar from country to country: focus on youth, preponderance of males among perpetrators and victims, disproportionate involvement of migrants and indigenous people, greater prevalence with socioeconomic disadvantage and low education, and the impact of underlying factors such as political disintegration, exclusion from the consumer lifestyle, and inadequacies of social institutions. In social disintegration theory, the basic explanatory backdrop is the dynamic relationship of integration and disintegration between and within the different spheres: individual and functional system integration, integration into society, and integration into the community. (Relative) exclusion from work, consumption, and democratic processes combined with experience of socioemotional deficits seem to give a particularly strong boost to socially unacceptable forms of particularist integration and to favor collective and individual acceptance of violence. When subjects draw balances of personal recognition and of the achieved and achievable scope to organize their life, the latter orientations appear subjectively more likely to meet their expectations than socially (more) accepted modes of behavior. The central conclusion on social reactions to violence in general and professional social work in particular is that rather than relying on admonishment, punishment, or curative measures, or some combination of these, to combat violence, there is a need for wide‐ranging long‐term options for those acutely affected and at risk to have the long‐term scope to organize their own lives—to experience life control, recognized integration, and development of competences. Those who experience being the organizer of their own life have no need of violence as a form of self‐assertion.",

      "abstract": "In recent years we may observe increasing interest in the development of social innovation both regarding theory as well as the practice of responding to social problems and challenges. One of the crucial challenges at the beginning of the 21st century is population ageing. Various new and innovative initiatives, programs, schemes, and projects to respond to negative consequences of this demographic process are emerging around the world. However, social theories related to ageing are still insufficiently combined with these new practices, social movements, organizational models, and institutions. Many scholars are still using notions and tools from classical theories of social gerontology or the sociology of ageing such as disengagement theory, activity theory, and successful and productive ageing. Such theories do not sufficiently explain ageing in the context of, for example, a broad use of the information and communications technologies (ICTs) including robotics and automation, new healthcare and long-term care models, advancements in the development and governance of age-friendly environments, and public engagement of older adults into co-production of services delivered by public, private, non-governmental as well as non-formal entities.",

      "title": "Social Psychology and Social Issues: Students’ Participation in Bridging the Gap",
      "abstract": "Understanding and dealing with social issues is definitely not an easy task. A social evil like 'Sati' was eradicated over a period of time and as a result of dedicated contributions of many and at the same time due to strict legal consequences. Thus, dealing with social issues and bringing about a social change requires intervention at many levels and by different means. There are various social issues that need to be dealt with. Some of these issues are well discussed, especially in media and to also certain extent in communities, amongst social scientists and even students. However, there are other issues that are equally relevant but do not get the adequate attention, whether its media, society or social scientists. It is thus important to first identify the social issues and then derive measures to deal with them. Social psychologists can play an important role in this regard by not only being more observant and sensitive but also by employing suitable research methodology to study these issues and design intervention strategies. Interventions can be carried out at various levels including individual, familial, community, societal, organizational, state and even at national and international levels. The present article will focus on, first of all, identifying various social issues. Further, it will also discuss about the relevance of research in order to understand these issues and its attributes. It will also focus on the significance of imbibing a sense of understanding and awareness about the social issues amongst the students of social psychology so as to develop in them a sense of concern and also identification with these issues. Thus, the article focuses on the role of both, the social psychologists of today and the social psychologists of future (students of social psychology), in order to bridge the gap between social psychology and social issues.",

It is therefore helpful to start with Webster's defi nition: 'to have or take a part or share with others (in some activity, enterprise, etc.)'. Participation refers to a process of partaking and also to the relations with others that refl ect this process. It suggests both action and connection\" (emphasis in original). Participation is a banal term that refl ects the most ordinary of experiences. An individual cannot live without participating, without doing things, without acting in relation to others. This is true of any individual at any age. We cannot imagine someone not participating in anything, since participation is fundamental to social life. However, some uses of the term at least partly contradict the idea that social life and participation are inseparable. Participation thus becomes an important issue and a topic for debate.",

      "title": "Community Consensus Is Available on a Moral Valuing Standard.",
      "abstract": "ommunity consensus is imperative ~d in a democratic society. Without responsible, informed consensus, public policy falls into tyranny or anarchy. With out consensus, free people cannot live to gether peaceably. Without agreement on the common standards of desirable be havior, there can be no common law. Democratic action must derive from com monly held values or cease to exist. Yet in any social group (including the school community), discussion of moral issues often snags on conflicting opinions some resulting from semantic misun derstandings, others stemming from unin formed preconceptions. The qualities of reasonableness and tolerance, essential to the achievement of consensus, become strained when educators, parents, and other community members concentrate only on their differences. Conversely, the development of consensus about moral behavior is only possible if community members openly consider the conse quences of possible alternatives. To do this requires tolerance and reasonableness even among those who think they are at odds. To successfully resolve conflict and find consensus, each person must examine the reasoning of others and carefully con sider the meaning of the words others use to convey their ideas. For the past 15 years Century III, a nonpolitical, nonsectarian research and educational foundation in Oak Brook, Il linois, has been facilitating this kind of thoughtful approach to moral consensus in communities across the U.S. The Cen tury III workshop process encourages par ticipants to discover common ground on moral principles through logical thinking and discussion with others of mutually ac ceptable and desirable values. Century III data suggest, in fact, that there is a latent moral standard inherent within each per son. It was no accident that brought Cen tury III to Salt Lake City to conduct a valuing analysis workshop in October 1979. Six months earlier the Salt Lake City ethics education program had been described in the Kappan.1 The program, centering on 12 ethical principles derived from national documents, drew criticism from a few readers, who claimed that not one of the 12 principles is universally ac ceptable. Meanwhile, Century III had announced in 1977 its interest in carrying out a national moral valuing research project. The goal of that project was (and still is) to conduct valuing analysis work shops in every state, in order to determine the degree of national consensus on a moral standard. Salt Lake City educators cared little about national consensus; they wished only to discover whether com munity sentiment justified the content of the local ethics education program. Cen tury III offered a well-tested structure for seeking out and describing community",

Individuals, organizations, companies, and governments are aware that what is being conveyed has an impact on the social values, but they also play a role in promoting societal problems, as empathy is the cornerstone of a healthy society. This article analyzes the following: (1) by what means and how did the communication of the expectations on women change during history (physical values/values regarding the appearance); (2) identifying the social problems of advertising campaigns; (3) the main guiding principle of Apple, Huawei and Samsung's advertising: the focus of their communication; (4) the values determined by Julia Roberts and the brands she represents; (5) the social problems promoted by world brands. The focus of the analyzes is on women, because women play a significant role in the implementation and solution of values and social problems, they also have an important role to play if they do not fight in the front line, but they are behind the scenes.",

      "title": "Inferring social meaning from language variation: liminality and gender",
      "abstract": "The variationist sociolinguistic enterprise has long been interested in the systematicities of language variation. While tensions between internal (structural) and external (social) factors have been productively explored within the variationist paradigm, there has been relatively little work addressing which factors drive change, and which merely condition it (e.g. Kristiansen 2011). The role of social meaning in shaping the trajectory of language change is being increasingly recognised, but the degree to which social interpretation of linguistic cues is subconscious (e.g. Campbell-Kibler 2010) complicates the matter from a methodological perspective. \r\n\tBeyond those variables that are easily articulable to members of a speech community (stereotypes in the Labovian sense), inferring social meaning from distribution alone is liable to underestimate the complexity of the social-structural interface. Multivariate analysis identifies factors that constrain variation, but cannot give any insight into the interpretability of those social constraints from the perspective of the speaker or the hearer. Perception studies provide a more socially-oriented analysis of the salience of variation (e.g. Niedzielski 1999, Strand 1999), but this experimental approach relies on already having identified relevant linguistic variables and social factors. By exploring a novel method for teasing apart social and structural variation, this paper presents a first step towards modelling these two types of variation independently, which will allow future research to more closely interrogate the processes by which synchronic variation accrues enough momentum to tip over into diachronic language change (e.g. Weinreich, Labov & Herzog 1968; Meyerhoff & Klaere 2017).\r\n\tThis paper focuses on the linguistic production of people who have crossed a socially reified category boundary and who are invested in presenting an authentic identity once across. A comparison of the linguistic variation in the speech of these ‘liminal’ people with that observed in members of the broader speech communities on either side of the boundary allows us to not only note where there are linguistic differences with respect to that boundary, but also to see which of these differences carry enough social meaning for liminal speakers to make use of them. This approach is explored with two data sets: one in New Zealand using transsexual participants (considered liminal with respect to gender), and an ongoing pilot project examining regional variation in the UK using actors as professionally liminal performers. The New Zealand project, with its small (n=46) purpose-built corpus of sociolinguistic interviews, finds that young trans men’s vowels are sometimes aligned with those of young men and sometimes those of young women. Given that NZE vowels are known to be undergoing change (e.g. Hay, Maclagan & Gordon 2008) and that gender is generally implicated in phonological change (Labov 1990, 2001), it seems that these trans men are highly attuned to which vowels are gendered, and selectively manipulate those variables to present a socially interpretable gendered identity. The UK pilot tests two related questions: Is the liminality construct extendable beyond the narrow scope of gender? And is liminality as productive in differentiating the social from the structural within relatively stable systems?",

Yet, one often overlooks the aspect of some technologies that can be of tremendous benefit or detriment to their potential impact on the social life of the older individual. As people age, there is evidence that their social interactions with others decline (Jylhä, 2004). Ideally, technology that supports independent living among older adults would also support or enhance opportunities for older adults to communicate both with family members and friends (Lövdén, Ghisletta, & Lindenberger, 2005...",

      "abstract": "Ethnomethodology, conversation analysis and actor-network-theory are taken as departing points for looking inside professional practice. Sociology and social work are closely connected as regards origin, academic organisation and societal focus. At the same time, they are clearly distinguishable as separate disciplines. The contrasts between the two fields, despite the close relationship, are manifest, not least when they are taken as wholes. Many sociological concepts and theories have been preoccupied with describing and explaining the antecedent conditions of action and its multiple outcomes, whether intended or unintended. This has to some extent been the case in Danish social work research. There has been a period of „tensions‟ between research on social work informed by this type of („macro‟)sociological theories on the one hand and on the other hand social work practice. As argued by Boden (1994) much social theory emphasises structure “over” action, making the latter invisible in the shadow of the former, and making social work an „invisible trade‟ (Pithouse 1987). A number of sociological approaches, however, emphasise (inter)action. Discourse and narrative approaches to social work, for instance, offer opportunities for looking inside professional practice (Hall & White 2005). More generally, approaches to social work research based on ethnomethodology, conversation analysis and actor-network-theory offers opportunities for a more close relationship between the two disciplines. In this paper I will outline some of the major developments in Danish social work research, giving examples of interconnections rather than contradictions and tensions between the two disciplines. The paper consists of three sections. In the first section, I will describe selected trends in the development of Danish social work research. In the second section I will argue for the relevance of a relational approach to social work practice based on ethnomethodological, conversation analytical and actor-network-theoretical concepts. In the third section I will discuss the relevance and „division of labour‟ between different (sociological) approaches and different perspectives in social work practice and research. The paper is drawing, among others, on two research projects, published in:  Eskelinen, L, S P Olesen & D Caswell (2008): Potentialer i social arbejde. Et konstruktivt blik pa faglig praksis (Potentials of social work. A constructive look at professional practice).

      "abstract": "Social enterprise (SE) emerges where there are opportunities to find new ways to balance otherwise competing interests and to achieve social purposes in ways that are better than and distinct from traditional approaches. Understanding whether the zoo and its elements are achieving these purposes, making progress, or causing harm is complicated and difficult. The challenges begin with assessing essential things that cannot be measured easily or well. They continue with how SE simultaneously has social impact at so many levels: individual, organizational, communal, within and among parts of the zoo, and society as a whole. They are exacerbated by the need to account for gains in one social impact area possibly being accompanied by harm in another. Of course, being complicated or challenging or even presently unprovable is no excuse for not trying. In that spirit this chapter approaches assessing the social impact of SE, its potential, and its distinguishing character at three key levels: the broad zoo itself for which the search for assessment tools is ongoing; the specific habitats and animals for which metrics, measures, and standards might be more accessible but for which accurate cross-purpose benchmarking is still a challenge; and the broader contexts within which the SE zoo exists, including traditional business, philanthropy, and the governmental regulatory environment. It is with respect to the latter – particularly with regard to priority of purpose and public accountability – that the social enterprise zoo has had its clearest impact so far.",

      "abstract": "Using data derived from focus groups, interviews, and the content analysis of widely circulated cultural scripts on dreaming, we document the social patterning of people’s future imaginings. People attend to, store, and activate different cultural scripts in building dreams for the future. These scripts derive from “pubic culture”—widely available repertoires, including values and beliefs; concepts; story frames, scripts, and narratives; customs, practices, and rules. We show that one’s “social location”—where class, race, or gender place people in social space—influences the particular cultural scripts ingrained in people’s minds. We also show that people use different forms of “personal culture” (nondeclarative and declarative, along with their accompanying cognitive styles) in expressing their dreams to others. Those attuned to the dominant scripts about dreaming, (generally those in privileged social locations), more often rely on nondeclarative culture in reporting what and why they dream. Those at odds with dominant scripts (generally those in less privileged locations) more often rely on declarative culture in explaining what and why they dream. Our study uses dreams to shed light on the relationship between public and personal culture—a task called for by current work in culture and cognition.",

      "abstract": "Les annees 90 sont encore plus que les precedentes decennies porteuses d'interrogations sur la validite des interventions sociales et les competences professionnelles des intervenants sociaux. Ces derniers sont, aujourd'hui, tres directement mis ou remis en cause et juges de moins en moins competents pour traiter seuls les questions sociales. Ils sont concurrences par d'autres agents, professionnels ou benevoles qui, comme eux, sont ou se sentent concernes par les difficultes sociales du moment. Au sein de la nouvelle dynamique qui semble s'appliquer actuellement a la definition des +questions sociales; et aux +solidarites essentielles;, les roles et fonctions d'information, de communication et de mediatisation, prennent une place croissante ; elles ne donnent pas vraiment plus de moyens pour inserer, accompagner, soigner les personnes atteintes d'un handicap ou souffrant d'une inadaptation ou d'une forme d'exclusion mais d'autres moyens et surtout une autre visibilite dans l'espace public qui vont influer sur les conditions d'existence et d'exercice de plusieurs groupes professionnels. Notre recherche montre les mecanismes par lesquels l'intervention sociale recoit des medias des elements qui vont entrer dans sa construction ou reconstruction et comment ces medias s'alimentent d'elements des questions sociales pour poursuivre leur propre construction. En d'autres termes, etudier d'un cote ce qui est mediatisable aujourd'hui dans les interventions sociales (le travail mediatique du social) et d'un autre, la part d'intervention sociale qui revient actuellement aux medias et principalement a la television (le travail social des medias). Apprehender la nature des co-constructions amorcees ou operees par le tramage de ces deux champs professionnels renvoie a observer et a analyser les changements dans la configuration et la disposition, dans l'espace public, des situations et identites professionnelles mais egalement dans la distribution et l'interpretation des roles de chacun d'entre eux. On observe deja que les transformations a l'œuvre dans l'un et l'autre de ces champs apparaissent comme autant d'elements d'un processus global de professionnalisation et de deprofessionnalisation et participent de l'articulation d'un nouveau dispositif de production de la realite sociale legitime",

      "abstract": "Voice and communication are seen as largely synonymous in social theory, democratic political theory, media studies and in more than 600 human communication theories that have been identified. That is to say, voice is normatively conceptualised as dialogic and communicative, not simply seen as speaking. However, in the context of organisations and organisation-public relationships (OPR), which are extensive in industrialised and institutionalised societies, research indicates that voice and communication are predominantly enacted as speaking. A pilot study reported in this article indicates that allegedly communicative functions including public relations, involve considerable and often massive resources devoted to creating an architecture of speaking and doing the work of speaking on behalf of organisations including government departments and agencies, corporations, and institutions. Conversely, this research raises serious questions about the extent to which organisations listen to those who seek to engage with them. Further, it suggests that organisations cannot effectively listen unless they have an architecture of listening or do the work of listening, and identifies cultural, structural, political and technological components to create this vital missing element in public communication and the public sphere.",

      "title": "Individual and ecological heterogeneity promote complex communication in social vertebrate group decisions",
      "abstract": "To receive the benefits of social living, individuals must make effective group decisions that enable them to achieve behavioural coordination and maintain cohesion. However, heterogeneity in the physical and social environments surrounding group decision-making contexts can increase the level of difficulty social organisms face in making decisions. Groups that live in variable physical environments (high ecological heterogeneity) can experience barriers to information transfer and increased levels of ecological uncertainty. In addition, in groups with large phenotypic variation (high individual heterogeneity), individuals can have substantial conflicts of interest regarding the timing and nature of activities, making it difficult for them to coordinate their behaviours or reach a consensus. In such cases, active communication can increase individuals' abilities to achieve coordination, such as by facilitating the transfer and aggregation of information about the environment or individual behavioural preferences. Here, we review the role of communication in vertebrate group decision-making and its relationship to heterogeneity in the ecological and social environment surrounding group decision-making contexts. We propose that complex communication has evolved to facilitate decision-making in specific socio-ecological contexts, and we provide a framework for studying this topic and testing related hypotheses as part of future research in this area. This article is part of the theme issue 'The power of sound: unravelling how acoustic communication shapes group dynamics'.",

      "abstract": "“Cultural Models” (CM) is a term that has come to apply to culturally standardized and shared/distributed cognitive structures for explaining or structuring action. They contrast with more cultural conceptual systems (such as kinship or ethnobiological terminological systems) and more general procedures analyzing and imposing initial structure on new problems. They are functionally a little like Schank and Abelson’s “scripts”. CMs combine motives, emotions, goals, mechanisms, classificatory information, etc.--in each case, perhaps, cross-linking to separate cognitive structures within which these separate entities are organized, structured, and classified--into possible actions. CMs can be used by individual actors to generate behavior--often after some consideration of the downstream implications of the choice of one model over another--but are not themselves the individual internal cognitive schemas that actually generate behavior. Different CMs are cross-linked with one another in a variety of ways. One area of cross-linkage includes models held by members of a given community in responsse to similar situations (as in overlap among models for doing similar things, modes for use in similar situations, models involving similar attidudes or goals, and so forth). Another kind of cross-linkage involves models for more or less the same thing that are held by members of different communities--expecially where membership overlaps in one way or another. CMs have to be easily learned, productive, and systematic. I want to discuss the implications of these kinds of overlap for the shape of cultural models and the way in which they are learned, held, and applied. Illustrative examples will be utilized, but no systematic formal description or model of CMs will be offered--it’s too soon.",

      "abstract": "Social success is an ambiguous category that has both external and internal criteria. Despite the difficult comprehension of the criteria and the ambiguity of their interpretation in different cultures and social strata, the desire for success in the form of various behavioral tendencies and manifestations is considered inherent in most people. The research results presented in the article were obtained on samples of different age groups: adolescence, young, adult age periods (from 17 to 45 years). The criteria of social success are considered through the prism of the leading activity of the age and are used as the basis for differentiating the samples into socially successful and unsuccessful respondents. The study is comparative in nature and shows that the cognitive markers of socially successful respondents differ from the mental trajectories of socially unsuccessful respondents. In adolescence, social success is accompanied by clear formulated goals and conscious plans for the future; in young and adult ages, while maintaining awareness of plans, socially successful respondents also have a high level of predictive abilities, expressed in the validity of the thinking process, flexibility of thinking, plasticity of ideas and the prospect of causal relationships. These cognitive characteristics allow a person to build mental processes in such a way that they accompany the person's social success.",

If the parties are completely independent, or if their interests, outcomes, and goals are completely compatible, then no conflict can exist, because, to put it colloquially, there is nothing to fight about. Conflict can occur in both cooperative and competitive contexts (Deutsch, 1973), as well as in “mixed‐motive” contexts that are marked by a combination of competitive and cooperative features. When the parties' interests are generally compatible or positively correlated, then resolving the conflict requires coordination (Kelley et al., 2003; Schelling, 1980).",

      "title": "Social Competence Scale for Adolescents (SCSA): Development and Validation within Cultural Perspective",
      "abstract": "Defining social competence has been a difficult task for social competence researchers and theorists. Some theorists have defined social competence in terms of enquiring effective social skills to manage social relationships (Dodge, 1985; Hubbard & Coie, 1994; Cavell, 1990; Gresham, 1986) While others define social competence as attaining relevant social goals in specified social contexts, using appropriate means, resulting in positive developmental outcomes (Ford, 1982). Irrespective of methodological differences and dimensional variations in explaining social competence, all social competence researchers and theorists unanimously agree that social competence refers to socially effective actions and social competence is totally distinct and clearly exclusive from cognitive ability (Brown & Anthony, 1990; Ford & Tisak, 1983).Undoubtedly, social competence has emerged as a salient personality trait for progressive development of human beings throughout the life span. As children grow up, their span of social interaction continues to increase with family members as well as with teachers, friends and, age fellows. Consequently, children would be in need to acquire more refined and sophisticated skills in order to smoothly mange their growing and emerging social relationships. Adolescence has been viewed as an age of dramatic social, emotional and developmental changes and parents have to accept an inevitable challenge of providing strong support, especially, at the time of transition from childhood to early adolescence. Researchers have identified some areas of conflict between adolescents and their parents during this transition, for example, peers' valued behaviours become more important than behaviours valued by parents (Lerner, Karson, Meisels & Knapp, 1975; Lerner & Shea, 1982). Some other researchers noted potential areas of conflict like peer demands and peer influences. Adolescents have strong desire to be accepted by at least some reference groups, mainly peer group, and to gain acceptability, adolescents involve in smoking, delinquent activities that are considered maladaptive behaviours by their parents and adults (Krosnick & Judd, 1982; West, 1982). Peer influence on adolescents may not be necessarily inconsistent with the expectations of parents or adults because peer pressure may enforce the adolescents to behave in antisocial or pro-social manner. Moreover, adolescents may enhance their positive social skills and understanding of relationship that directly relates to peer group (Burleson, 1985; Kurdek & Krile, 1982; Bemdt, 1979). Adolescents have strong urge to achieve social autonomy in order to develop more mature relationships with peers, and to take more social responsibilities (Sacks & Wolffe, 2006).Schneider, Ackerman and Kanfer (1996) reported that social competence has several independent dimensions such as extraversion, warmth, social influence, social openness, social appropriateness, social maladjustment and social insight. All these dimensions of social competence were closely related to Big Five personality dimensions and less related with cognitive abilities. On the contrary, researchers also reported very different dimensions of social competence i.e., social intelligence, social influence and social memories (Kosmitzki & John, 1993). Schneider et al., (1996) surprisingly reported that some dimensions that were expected like social skills and social self regulation did not emerge as exclusive dimensions and no dimension like self monitoring and impression management emerged. Researchers exploring dimensions of social competence reported conflict resolution skills, intimacy skills, prosocial behaviour, self-control/behaviour regulation, social confidence, social initiative, assertiveness, social efficacy , and empathy/sympathy as an important dimension of adolescents' social competence (Newcomb & Bagwell, 1995; Wentzel & Caldwell, 1997; Wentzel & Erdley, 1993;Young & Bradley, 1998; McFarlane, Bellissimo, & Norman, 1995; Barber & Erickson, 2001; Murphy et al. …",

Thus, there are a variety of contexts in which planned social change is practiced including → Health Communication, political transformation, crisis management (→ Crisis Communication), technological innovation, and → modernization. Across each of these areas, the predominant goal is to improve the quality of life and the standard of living within a given social system. Ostensibly, the goal of planned social change is the betterment of society, though there may be no consensus on which goals of the campaign are most important and indeed whether they are socially desirable at all.",

Examples of ‘behaviour change fields’ include (but are not limited to) education, training, enforcement, infrastructure, technology, urban planning, community development, health promotion, and social marketing. Each discipline has evolved with its own unique theories, tools and techniques. On first inspection each behaviour change field appears very different owing to the unique language arising from the diverse theories, tools and techniques. However closer inspection indicates far more similarities than differences. For example, social marketers refer to concepts such as formative research while for public health these efforts are termed needs assessment. But the lack of connectedness of behaviour change fields has meant they are rarely combined. This has not gone un-noticed: the sector has been criticised as operating within silos, and this narrow operating structure may be a contributing factor towards an inability to attain sustainable behaviour change (House of Lords Review 2010; Schneider and Stokols 2009; Rayner and Lang 2009). With few exceptions, creating sustainable behaviour change is hard to do, yet academics and professionals within each discipline have tended to persist in using long standing narrow foci in the belief that their approach may be superior to other behaviour change approaches and/or a single approach will suffice.",

      "title": "Developing Sociocultural Competence in the ESL Classroom",
      "abstract": "1.1 The importance of developing sociocultural competence If we were to meet an adult native speaker who had grown up in a place where there were no other people, but sufficient language input, through, for example, tapes, for that person to be in linguistic terms a fluent speaker, then it seems reasonable to say that this person would in all likelihood be regarded as socially dysfunctional. Our unfortunate would not know how to deal with the most simple situations, and unless he or she were protected and educated, a sorry end may well be just around the corner. While such a case is fantastical, the non-native speaker (NNS) who arrives in an alien culture which is markedly different from their own and who lacks sociocultural knowledge is in a position with certain parallels to that of a socially inadequate individual (Furnham 1993). While knowledge could be transferred from the native culture, there is no way of guessing correctly what the possible cultural differences or similarities are. Native speakers (NSs) would be unaware of the visitor’s lack of sociocultural knowledge (Blum-Kulka 1997), and both NNSs and NSs may even be unaware that cultures can vary as much as they do (Hinkel 2001). NSs are also likely to be find behaviour that runs counter to their society’s beliefs or norms unacceptable, and to react accordingly. After perusing Celce-Murcia et al’s (1995) list of sociocultural factors (see appendix 1), it is not difficult to see how inappropriacy in any of the listed areas could lead to problems. The acceptable length of a silence varies across cultures, and one possible reason for some students’ perceived reticence in ESL contexts could be caused by the fact that in certain cultures, people are comfortable with longer response times than is the case in English. Gestures vary across cultures, and are used to express abstract ideas (McCafferty and Ahmed 2000); potential for confusion is therefore plentiful and plain. In a liberal Western country such as England, men coming from a more patriarchal society could easily find themselves being rebuked or criticised, and might feel at a loss as to why. When and to whom the words ‘Thank you’ are required to be said in England is a notoriously confusing area, and a source of much resentment among the inhabitants of towns where there is a constant influx of language learners. While the above examples show the significance of sociocultural factors in communication, the key question is how this knowledge relates to and is formulated in language, and in particular a second language. Pavlenko and Lantolf (2000) argue that traditional models of second language acquisition account for the way we acquire lexical, phonological and grammatical units of knowledge, but that in order to understand language use in context, and therefore the pervasiveness of culture in communication, a model which accounts for learning as participation is necessary. In this model, the learner develops skills which enable him or her to engage with contextual and cultural factors of communication . Although the two models are not mutually exclusive but in fact complementary, the latter is far more appropriate for understanding language as socialisation, as an ongoing process of engagement",

On the other hand, the paper considers the possibility of the dicotomic alternation between those pronouns of address in contemporary Spanish as an expression of two classes of politeness: positive politeness and negative politeness (Brown &amp; Levinson 1987). The aim of sociolinguistics and other related disciplines is to analyses the psychological, social and contextual factors that may move individuals and social groups to choose one model of address or another. Some speakers, like younger people or women, especially in non instrumental speech events and situations, have a significant correlation with the use of tú in the speech community studied in the paper.",

This research employs qualitative analysis and descriptive analysis as its technique for analyzing the data. The researcher uses his logic when discussing this research, in which the researcher is an instrument of the research. The validity of the result of this research is carried out by data triangulation analysis. The process of validating the result is also carried out with a focus group discussion which involves seven expert lecturers in the history of civilization. In practice, recognition can be made verbally, in documents, and in behavior (attitude). Active efforts or positive interactions can be in the form of mutual cooperation activities, willingness to get along, helping each other, visiting each other, gathering in a forum to solve a problem, or other activities. In principle, conflicts that have occurred in Surakarta can be identified and triggered by several factors: ethnics factors; political factors (macro politics, national and micropolitics, regional; economic factors (the dominant factor); the factor of social segregation, which consists of social segregation based on ethnic trading area, social segregation based on religious territory, and cultural segregation between the Kasunanan and Mangkunegaran communities having different characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Previously, it was widely believed that each species has a specific social organization, but we know now that many species show intraspecific variation in their social organization. Four different processes can lead to intraspecific variation in social organization: (i) genetic variation between individuals owing to local adaptation (between populations) or evolutionarily stable strategies within populations; (ii) developmental plasticity evolved in long-term (more than one generation) unpredictable and short-term (one generation) predictable environments, which is mediated by organizational physiological effects during early ontogeny; (iii) social flexibility evolved in highly unpredictable environments, which is mediated by activational physiological effects in adults; (iv) entirely extrinsic factors such as the death of a dominant breeder. Variation in social behaviour occurs between individuals in the case of genetic variation and developmental plasticity, but within individuals in the case of social flexibility. It is important to study intraspecific variation in social organization to understand the social systems of species because it reveals the mechanisms by which species can adapt to changing environments, offers a useful tool to study the ultimate and proximate causes of sociality, and is an interesting phenomenon by itself that needs scientific explanation.",

Human sociality has several broad implications for development interventions: (1) economic incentives may not necessarily prove the best nor the only way to motivate individuals; (2) sharing and reciprocity among group members can contribute to the well-being of a community; (3) the willingness of individuals to cooperate in the pursuit of shared goals means that institutions and interventions can harness social preferences; and (4) human societies develop social norms as a means of both coordinating and regulating behavior and expressing community values. Societies can get stuck in collective patterns of behavior that arguably do not serve anyone's interests, however, and \"optimizing behavior\" by individuals can lead to suboptimal social outcomes. As a result, norms change may sometimes prove necessary for social change.",

Other social institutions, such as family, community, media and popular culture, work and prisons are salient arenas in which behaviours and lives are regulated. They all interrelate and are all implicated in the generation, management and development of social identities and the social and cultural reproduction of structures and relations. Individuals, though, are not merely shaped by these social institutions, their agency is evident in the way they creatively adapt and accommodate to the tensions and constraints of economic, educational and social policies. The maintenance of self in these situations requires identity work involving mediation, conflict, contestation and modes of resistance, which often contribute to a continual reconstruction of situations and contexts.",

Can social determinism be countered by the force of self-determination sustained by group members’ personal autonomy, critical consciousness, and strong engaged integrated identity? These questions are addressed by testing a revised Self-determination and ethnolinguistic development (SED) model, using structural equation modeling. This model specifies how three categories of language socialization (enculturation, personal autonomization, critical consciousness-raising) mediate between objective ethnolinguistic vitality (EV) and four psycholinguistic constructs (engaged integrated identity, community engagement, linguistic competencies, subjective EV) in the prediction of minority language use. Results on a large sample of French Canadian students in different EV settings strongly support the SED model and show that social determinism can be at least moderately countered by psycholinguistic constructs that increase individual self-determination.",

      "abstract": "Sociodramatic play occurs when two or more children adopt roles and attempt to recreate a real-life situation. For example, several children may take on the roles of family members and pretend to eat dinner, or they may adopt roles as firefighters and battle a make-believe fire. This type of play is commonly seen in the housekeeping and block areas of many preschools and kindergartens. Piaget (1951) classifies play into three categories that correspond to different stages of cognitive development: (a) practice play, which dominates the sensorimotor stage (ages birth2); (b) symbolic play, which comes into prominence during the preoperational stage (ages 2-7); and (c) games with rules, which become prevalent during the concrete operational stage (ages 7 11). Within this system, sociodramatic play is classified as the most highly developed form of symbolic play (Frost and Klein 1979). As in all types of symbolic play, sociodramatic play involves using symbols to represent objects that are not present. In addition, sociodramatic play requires that children adopt roles as other people and plan a story line or plot that is related to the chosen roles. Children must also cooperate and communicate with others in order to",

In his model, autonomous agents first recognise how they depend on each other (they may need or prefer to interact about the same or different goals), and then, in the negotiation phase, exchange offers in the form of commissive speech acts. Finally, agents adopt social, interlocking, commitments if an agreement is reached. Joint plans are seen as deals and team activity as a special case of social activity. The main contributions of the work are: (a) social pre-conventions are not needed; (b) the outcome of the coordination process can achieve agents' goals only partially; (c) social notions are defined as the conjunction of their individual counterparts.",

An understanding of exchange dynamics between hosts and migrants is crucial in designing measures to support harmonious relations, improve professional and social opportunities for both groups, and mitigate potentially self-exclusionary tendencies, such as radicalization (Lyons-Padilla et al., 2015). Host societies that are unable or unwilling to engage in exchange with migrants risk missing out on their potential professional and/or social contributions; and even experience challenges to their collective sense of non-belonging ‘at home’ (Kymlicka, 2013). Migrants who cannot or will not exchange with hosts may find their access to jobs, financial services, and education limited, hindering their social integration and depriving them of ‘participation parity’ (Fraser, 2003) and a sense of belonging in the host society (Cheah et al., 2013; Croucher et al., 2016; Salignac et al., 2016), and increasing the risk that both groups may engage in self-protective strategies such as self-exclusion or ‘self-encapsulation’ (EC, 2008; Rezaei, 2002).",

      "title": "(mis)uses of essentialism in a language policy-making context",
      "abstract": "In recent years, it has been much more common to ground sociolinguistic studies in concepts of language practices, language crossings and communicative repertoires, owing to the field’s growing recognition of the complexity and dynamism of language use. However, in language policy-making in many parts of the world, where language and education specialists are directly involved in language and education policy-making, linguistic essentialism is prevalent but sometimes a necessary component of struggles for the official recognition of marginalized languages and communities. Linguistic essentialism mainly refers to the belief that languages are separate, idealized entities, and that they represent identities and cultures which do not intersect and remain unchanging. Yet, many deployments of linguistic essentialism have led to reconfigured systems of education which have, in many contexts, resulted in more democratic and more equitable learning spaces. How can/should we respond to such kind of essentialism? These could be strategic uses of essentialism because of their deployment as provisional necessary conceptual tools for specific political projects (Spivak, 1988). However, an examination of these essentialisms shows their unchanging nature or their lack of critical self-reflection, thus failing to account for changing sociolinguistic and socio-political realities. In the Philippines, linguistic essentialisms helped institutionalize the national language, Filipino, as a medium of instruction by discursively promoting it as the language of nationalism, cultural expression and identity, and anti-colonial struggle. In the process, these discourses undermined the hegemony of English as the sole language of instruction in the country, thus resulting in the promulgation of the bilingual education policy in 1974. At the same time, however, the same discourses marginalized the role of the country’s more than a hundred mother tongues as languages of instruction, nationalism, cultural expression and identity and political struggle. Linguistic essentialisms are part and parcel of language policy-making and should be viewed and appraised in the light of historically contingent political projects that deployed them. However, they must continuously change to remain relevant, self-critically nuancing their own positions and always open to reconfigurations of languages in society.",

It is meaning of the word \"slogan\" - \"call, briefly expressing the leading idea, problem or party demands a certain historical moment\". The content and objectives of the slogans define their shape. Converts to the audience, intended for immediate perception, successful slogans are widely understood, catchy, concise and easy to remember. Slogans contain certain ideologies designed to induce sympathy in society. Ideologema - is succinctly expressed socially significant values, designed to promote the political consolidation of the voters in order to achieve electoral aims. In this paper a comparative analysis of the signs of \"mission\", \"slogan\" and \"purpose\"; analyzes the objectives of the State Program of the Russian Federation, are identified and justified by the disadvantages.",

      "abstract": "The process of integration and social inclusion appears to be significantly complicated issue both from the perspective of accepting society, and from the one of people, who are arriving to the receiving country. The difficulty depends on circumstances of arriving, level of economical prosperity, time or lack of one for preparation for the process of relocation (thus, the refugees and forcibly displaced persons usually encounter a wider number of challenges comparing to ordinary migrants); educational, linguistic and professional level. What is more, the correlation between indexes of adequate and flexible migrational policy in any given country on one hand, and level of success of integration and social inclusion on the other one, depends also on the generation, the representatives of which we are talking about. Therefore, if we are talking about generation of properly \"newcomers\", their process of integration/social inclusion may be aggravated by numerous cultural, traditional, social and societal differences, as well as prejudices and biases both accepting and newcomers' societies possess towards each other. Therefore, the more proper and specially adapted the program of integration and social inclusion will be, the more human and professional potential representatives of generation of newcomers will be able to introduce into accepting society, instead of \"sacrificing their everything to provide for their family\", as it is right now. Self-realization of representatives of generation of newcomers is a key to successful integration/social inclusion policy towards generation of newcomers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article draws on interactional pragmatics and a cross-cultural approach (UK, France, Spain) to investigate the negotiation of individual and group identities in two different speech events, parliamentary debates and editorial meetings. The cross-cultural examination of the use of linguistic resources for signalling 'social role, boundaries and bonds' (Chilton, P., Analysing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice. London: Routledge, 2004, p. 48) serves to explore how speakers use language strategically to position themselves and others, renegotiate or resist positioning, offer rallying points and forge 'defensible alignments' (Goffman, E., Forms of Talk. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1981, p. 325). In the case of personal deixis, it shows that both quantitative and qualitative methods can be used to pinpoint cultural specificities – for example, a more frequent use of explicit performatives in the Spanish and, particularly, the French data to hedge commitment to propositions, and, in English-language parliamentary debate, a use of truth hedging signalling strong commitment for coercive interactive positioning. In the case of indeterminacy of reference, in, for example, the use of 'asides', in the English-language editorial meeting humour was used to bond participants in the pursuit of common goals; cultural allusion and references in Latin and English were used in the Spanish parliament for positioning; verbal wit and virtuosity were particularly important in the community of practice of the French parliament.",

The analysis is carried out in three methodological directions: political (the formation of the precariat is determined by political factors); economic and technological (precarious practices are considered from the point of view of economic flexibility); functionalist (fixation of an individual’s psychological characteristics specific to precarious practices is carried out). It is proved that it is the functional approach that gives grounds for further considerations regarding the life strategies chosen by the precariats, as well as their attitude to the state as the main source of their problems. It was revealed that the combination of a high protest potential with a low ability to organize makes the precariat an environment where, against the background of a low material status, fear and uncertainty about one's future can generate extreme forms of reaction to them – from the conforming acceptance in an individual order of the labor relations’ formats, which are provoked by employers, to spontaneous mass protests, which, however, are not able to eliminate the causes of precariousness, but often turn into trashes, intensified by inter-racial and inter-confessional contradictions",

      "abstract": "Social work practice should reflect important professional values and principles, including client self-determination, empowerment, human diversity, and cultural sensitivity. To practice effectively with diverse clients, social workers receive considerable training about multiple dimensions of social diversity, including age, race and ethnicity, culture, socioeconomic status, religion, political ideology, sex and gender, and sexual orientation (Council on Social Work Education, 2008). Despite consistent progress in training social workers to be more aware and culturally competent in dealing with diversity issues, there remain some important gaps, particularly concerning diverse sexual identities, that warrant more education and awareness among social workers (Scherrer, 2013; Williams, 2013). Without awareness, social workers are likely to unintentionally project their own biases and subsequent microaggressions onto vulnerable clients. The practice of polyamory is one such gap that has escaped attention of the social work profession. This particular gap in practice knowledge recently has been acknowledged in other helping professions, and scholars are realizing that it can have serious implications for clients (Brandon, 2011; Graham, 2014; Weitzman, Davidson, & Phillips, 2009).",

      "abstract": "In what is officially a bilingual nation-state, post-colonial Maltese public institutions operate without explicit language policy guidance, such as provided in other jurisdictions by ‘language schemes’. Whilst both official languages are used in formal institutions, English appears to be the more popular choice of language for organisational texts. As social practices are a better indicator of actual language ideologies (Spolsky, 2004), a transdisciplinary approach was adopted, looking into select textually-mediated practices that coordinate institutionally-based activities (Smith, 1990b; Campbell and Gregor, 2004) and textual analysis (Fairclough, 2003). Taking texts as social spaces where the ideational and interpersonal metafunctions of language are activated (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2014; Fairclough, 1995) and writing as a disembedding mechanism (Giddens, 1990), choice of language in organisational texts may be due to the need for objectifying knowledge for sharing within the relations of ruling (Smith, 1990a; Campbell and Gregor, 2004), abstract, intangible social connections predominantly involved in the social organisation of knowledge societies within a global inter-state system (Hopkins and Wallerstein, 1982). The analysis suggests that language choice in institutional texts may depend on knowledge exchange systems designed for frontstage and backstage performativity. Furthermore, these language patterns imply that the environment within which these language practices occur needs to be accounted for in terms of polycentric social space (Lefebvre, 1991; Soja, 1985; Blommaert, 2007). Such variation, as well as the apparent stability of such language differentiation, may be better understood when looking beyond the borders of the nation-state and taking the world analysis system (WSA) as one influential model to understand language choice.",

Thus social indicators will frequently, though not necessarily, be normative and they will often, though again not necessarily, be concerned with outputs rather than inputs. Although many writers regard social indicators as being combinations of series, the problems of construction are substantial. Central to the idea of a social indicator, however, is that it should represent or summarize a broader concept than itself and that it should belong to a structure or system of series. Although there are no social theories about society in general on which a structure of indicators can at present be based there are a number of middle range theories relating to specific fields or sectors, such as occupational mobility, education, migration, mental health, etc., around which quantitative relationships and models can gradually be be built to give insight into social changes and perhaps eventually into the manipulation of policy instruments for the improvement of social conditions.",

      "title": "Barriers to Addressing Social Issues in Organizations and How to Overcome Them",
      "abstract": "Organizations are increasingly involving themselves in social issues such as sustainability, racial justice, and COVID-19 safety measures. But in order to engage in a formal effort to help such causes, someone must first raise awareness of these social issues within the organization. Two relevant processes through which this can be done is issue selling and allyship. Issue selling refers to employee efforts to raise awareness of and direct attention of higher-ups toward issues that the organization can address (Dutton & Ashford, 1993). Initial research on issue selling focused on employees selling issues that were more directly relevant to organizational performance, but as employees have gained comfort advocating for issues in the workplace, issue selling research has expanded to include employees’ selling of social issues that are not directly related to an organization’s core business (Mayer, Ong, Sonenshein, & Ashford, 2019; Sonenshein, 2006, 2009). Allyship refers to dominant group members taking actions to order improve the experiences of nondominant group members (e.g., reducing experiences of discrimination; promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion). Allyship can take many forms, including advocacy of relevant issues in the organization, providing social support to nondominant group members, and educating oneself on issues connected to allyship. Collectively, issue selling and allyship are important because they both capture important ways that people make progress on social issues in organizations, broadly speaking. People interested in issue selling and allyship, however, often face many barriers, such as fatigue, a lack of self-confidence, local norms discouraging these behaviors, and competing workplace demands. These barriers prevent individuals from taking actions to address social issues they care deeply about and prevent organizations from addressing social issues that they have taken a purported interest in undertaking. Therefore, it is critical that research continues to understand the barriers that people face when advocating for social issues and the factors that allow them to overcome these barriers. The proposed symposium brings together interdisciplinary and multimethod research that collectively identifies new barriers to people’s advocacy for social issues and/or new individual-level and institutional-level considerations for promoting social issues in organizations. The four papers use a variety of methodologies to understand how people advocate for social issues: ethnography, interviews, surveys, and archival sources. In addition, they focus on a number of pressing issues that our society faces today: sustainable development, climate change, diversity and inclusion.

      "abstract": "Puede que sorprenda el titulo de la presente comunicacion, pero pretendemos demostrar que ese a ninguna parte describe bastante bien la realidad actual de la socializacion escolar. Para empezar, hablar de socializacion escolar implica analizar primero el modelo de sociedad en el que se inscribe. En este sentido, es bien conocido que la idea clasica de sociedad preponderante practicamente hasta los anos 70, ya no explica el complejo entramado de relaciones politico-economico-socio-culturales que tiene lugar en estos momentos. A diferencia de la idea clasica en la que un modelo coherente de explicacion del funcionamiento de la sociedad se traducia en un modelo unico y coherente de socializacion escolar, la complejidad de la sociedad actual conlleva distintos modelos de socializacion concluyentes y en ocasiones contrapuestos. Asi, se constata como conviven modelos basados en la transmision de valores economicos (flexibilidad, competitividad, eficiencia, flexibilidad, libertad de eleccion,?), con otros con un fuerte componente tanto politico (exito personal vinculado al logro academico, igualdad de oportunidades y desigualdad de distribucion socio-economica, democracia,?) como civico/humanitario (solidaridad, paz, tolerancia,?), que por propia naturaleza nunca podrian conformar un todo coherente, pero que sin embargo explican el proceso de socializacion que esta teniendo lugar en el sistema educativo. A su vez, las proporciones en las que concurren estos distintos modelos de socializacion, companeros forzosos de ese viaje a ninguna parte, creemos que dependen de manera clara del nivel de ensenanza, de la titularidad y el ideario de cada centro. No obstante, ahondando en la misma complejidad a la que hemos hecho referencia en un principio, consideramos, por un lado, que la titularidad no explica por si sola el predominio de los modelos anteriormente citados, debiendose tener en cuenta la clase social de la clientela de los centros escolares, ya que esta define las prioridades educativas de sus hijos; y por otro, que los idearios, a su vez, no tienen por que coincidir con las practicas docentes cotidianas.\nUn ultimo apunte para la reflexion: partiendo de estos modelos, ?como construyen los alumnos su experiencia escolar?. Es decir, participando ahora el alumno del doble rol de actor y sujeto del proceso de socializacion escolar, y teniendo en cuenta que actualmente se considera protagonista absoluto de su vida, ?que tipo de construcciones realizan los alumnos para conformar su identidad?",

      "abstract": "The quality of communication is a key factor in determining the degree of group’s stability and mobility, which directly or indirectly is realized by all its members. The interest in matters of communication manifests itself at all levels of the hierarchical organization of the group. The examples of display of interest can equally be the language policy of a state, and homeschool, gender or group education, and language-related recreational forms of interaction, and then some. Still, today we can say that the norm is actively used only on the periphery of the totality of speech acts produced by people; in those areas of communication, which are rarely turned to by the majority of speakers. So, it is the category of communicative freedom which is equally important for a communicative space",

      "title": "Die gesundheitliche Versorgung von wohnungslosen Menschen mit psychischen Problemen",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund: Wohnungslosigkeit ist ein vielerorts kaum zu übersehendes und trotzdem gesamtgesellschaftlich weitgehend ignoriertes Phänomen. Menschen mit psychischen Problemen und bestehender Abhängigkeitserkrankung finden sich überzufällig häufig in der Gruppe Wohnungsloser. Methode: Eine internationale systematische Literaturrecherche wurde mit einer deutschsprachigen Recherche in der Datenbank des Netzwerkes für Versorgungsforschung kombiniert, um aktuelle Ergebnisse von Interventionen für Wohnungslose mit psychischen Erkrankungen darzustellen. Ergebnisse: Insbesondere im anglo-amerikanischen Sprachraum werden viele gemeindenahe Ansätze wie Housing First und Assertive Community Treatment beschrieben, die gute Ergebnisse für Wohnstabilität und Lebenszufriedenheit zeigen. Gemischt sind die Ergebnisse für die psychische Gesundheit. Forschung im deutschsprachigen Raum ist vergleichsweise defizitär. Ausblick: Niedrigschwellige oder aufsuchende Angebote scheinen vorteilhaft zu sein. Doch die Befunde lassen sich aufgrund sozialrechtlicher Unterschiede nicht per se auf die hiesigen Gegebenheiten übertragen. Das Problem wird gegenwärtig durch den sozialstrukturellen Wandel mit dem Aufkommen Geflüchteter verschärft.",

      "abstract": "El presente ensayo versa sobre dos estrategias metodologicas que serian muy similares entre si, aunque esto no lo declaren frecuentemente sus seguidores. Se trata de las metodologias cualitativas de investigacion social y cultural y de las metodologias de participacion social y comunitaria. Las primeras se conocen bien en el ambito de la sociologia y la antropologia, mientras las segundas suelen implementarse como formulas de adscripcion de la poblacion a la planificacion descentralizada de estados nacionales. En apariencia no habria mayor necesidad de dialogo entre ambas estrategias, pero tras revisar sus desarrollos metodologicos, parecen emerger algunas concomitancias hasta ahora no discutidas y poco advertidas. Y no solo se trata de coincidencias tecnicas (como el empleo de las entrevistas de profundidad, las historias de vida, las historias locales y otras) sino de una concepcion comun acerca del conocimiento, lo que podria revisarse detenidamente. Por lo pronto, mas alla de encontrar algunas casualidades de forma, esta es una invitacion a pensar que la posible comunidad entre ambas metodologias estaria revelando que comparten origen en una misma matriz epistemologica y filosofica.",

      "abstract": "Teaching and learning can be viewed as forms of enculturation into a community of practice. Usually teaching and learning are considered to occur in classrooms, which can be regarded as evolving communities of practice in which the discursive practices (e.g., talk, writing, cognition, argumentation, and representation) of participants are constantly changing in response to the interactions of a teacher and students, not only with one another, but also with social structures, such as conventions and norms (e.g., McGinn, Roth, Boutonné, and Woszczyna, 1995; Roth, 1995) and power relations (Bourdieu, 1991). Learning in such communities, it is argued, is most effective when the cultural resources of participants are acknowledged as capital for learning, teachers and learners can access a shared language, and power is equitably distributed (Tobin, 1997).",

      "abstract": "L'avaluacio de serveis i programes socials es en el nostre pais i dintre de la nostra comunitat academica i professional un aspecte pendent de desenvolupament, tant pel que fa a la seva conceptualitzacio i sistematitzacio com a la seva aplicacio practica i professional. En el primer aspecte, cal aprofundir en les relacions entre avaluacio i serveis socials, mentre que en el segon aspecte cal modificar actituds i desenvolupar processos d'aprenentatge i de reflexio dintre de les diverses comunitats professionals implicades. D'altra banda sempre hem pensat que els serveis i programes socials presenten unes caracteristiques identificatives que els diferencien i distingeixen d'altres programes similars, per la qual cosa no es viable l'aplicacio mecanica de dissenys provinents d'altres ambits del benestar social (com pot ser el cas de la sanitat o de l'educacio escolar) cosa que fa necessari el desenvolupament de dissenys especifics d'avaluacio aplicats al camp dels serveis socials. Pero, per altra banda, aquests serveis i programes socials presenten una profunda diversitat i pluralitat d'experiencies i de realitats, de tal manera que no es possible referir-nos a una unica tipologia de serveis i programes, sino que hem de referir-nos a un conjunt plural i divers de tipologies. Aixo significa que els dissenys d'avaluacio de serveis i programes socials han de ser plurals i adaptats a la realitat i a les caracteristiques aprticulars de cada servei o programa en particular. En consequencia, els objectius de la tesi que presentem son els seguents: 1r. Definir i caracteritzar el Sistema Catala de Serveis Socials. 2n. Oferir una aproximacio conceptual i epistemologica a la teoria general de l'avaluacio. 3r. Identificar els principals temes de debat i/o de reflexio que s'associen amb l'avaluacio, independentment del seu camp especific d'aplicacio. 4t. Revisar la literatura cientificotecnica mes important sobre el topic especific de la tesi. 5e. Revisar les aportacions existents sobre les diverses alternatives metodologiques existents en el camp de l'avaluacio en general i de l'avaluacio de serveis i programes socials en particular. 6e. Establir els trets caracteristics mes significatius d'un model d'avaluacio que es fonamenti en principis democratics i participatius, i que tingui present la utilitat social dels resultats i de les conclusions de qualsevol avaluacio. 7e. Identificar les fases que han de configurar tot proces d'avaluacio de serveis i programes socials, fent esment especial a la negociacio de l'encarrec institucional inicial i l'elaboracio i la presentacio dels informes finals d'avaluacio. 8e. Generar tres dissenys d'avaluacio d'acord amb els principis teorics exposats anteriorment. Aquests tres dissenys han de mostrar la diversitat i la pluralitat de serveis i programes que configuren l'actual sistema de serveis socials.",

The concept of the global village and its attendant social complexity will challenge individuals with anomalous events and issues that do not conform to our current systems thinking structures. Because such events and problems exist outside our traditional and familiar models of problem structuring, they appear ill-defined. Advanced modes of thought will be required to solve these types of ill-structured problems that real life will present. Failure to facilitate the development of postformal reasoning skills in organizations may manifest itself in an unacceptable difference in problem-solving behavior between those with postformal cognition and those reasoning at less cognitively dynamic levels.",

      "title": "Organizational Empowerment versus Clientelism",
      "abstract": "Development projects are inscribed in concrete relations of power. These relations have multiple dimensions, presenting themselves at almost all levels of a project—between communities and their surroundings, among project beneficiaries, in connection with the conditions and circumstances that the project is attempting to change, among the institutions that participate in the project, and between technical advisers and beneficiaries. Many development projects do not recognize these power relations in their training and implementation regimes, focusing instead on formal institutional relations. Probably because they conceive of the individual as an abstract entity isolated from any social context, they tend to view that individual as an intellectual being rather than as a social being of flesh and bone inscribed in relations of power with certain circumstances of rank, of domination and subordination, of interests, values, and ideas. This approach neglects the relations that order society, defining positions and opportunities and generating and maintaining a system of incentives and punishments directed toward the consolidation of positions, channels of social advancement, values, and behaviors. Not viewing individuals within the power relations that are the basis of social organization makes it impossible to fully understand their motivations or the logic of their behavior toward institutions and their functionaries and toward the various groups and organizations in which they participate. When projects are designed and policies are formulated with the goal of a fair and efficient administration that will avoid clientelism, the assumption is that things will turn out as expected. Existing relations are ignored, overlooking the fact",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> <i>\"The experience of entering into community is more enduring than the Self\" </i>(Balfour Mount, 2012) As social animals we are biologically, cognitively, physically, and spiritually wired to love, to be loved, to belong and to be accepted; social connexion is one of our fundamental human needs (e.g. Maslow 1943, 1954). Burr (1995) suggests that our 'identity originates not from inside the person but from the social realm'. In a world of digital communication our research aimed to explore patients' experiences of connectivity; do certain kinds of communication play a role in increasing/decreasing feelings of e.g. isolation, connectivity, wellbeing and sense of identity? We hoped our findings might influence developments in hospice communication styles and services in accordance with patients' preferences. 'Unstructured' interviews with 50 patients explored the type of communication used in different contexts and within different relationships, specifically: Are there preferred contexts/types of conversations for face-to-face, landline, mobile, text, email and social networks communication? How does the relationship influence the type of communication e.g. between family, friends, neighbours, colleagues, professionals? Individual experiences and relationships with these multiple communications? <h3>Findings</h3> Digital multimedia communications were found to be beneficial in providing a sense of connectivity and self-identity Face-to-face connectivity with neighbours and friends is reported to be rare and family face-to-face contact is often reported as infrequent. Digital communication, social networks and structured activities (e.g. hospice services) are found to be a valuable source of connectivity; patients find they can share their inner most feelings, experience decreased feelings of isolation and increased feelings of well-being. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hospices need to widen and develop: Communication styles with patients e.g. email, text and innovative and creative services which provide opportunities to connect with those in similar circumstances e.g. IT skills workshops for patients/carers, rehabilitation services, psychosocial therapeutic groups and activities.",

      "abstract": "The complexity and multiplicity of multilingual communicative practices and exchanges that characterize today's world are very difficult to understand and translate into coherent and inclusive actions, in terms of language policies, national bilingual education systems and action protocols within the main public institutions. 'Languaging', 'translanguaging', 'polylanguaging', 'crossing', 'metrolanguaging', 'transidomatic practices' and other terminologies reflect attempts to define the complex and unstable current situation (Blommaert & 2014). Institutional arrangements, called 'official language policies', function as mediations based on the assumption that a harmonious and multilingual multicultural society can be molded on the logic of capitalist economies with subsidies for poverty and social inequalities. However, their actions do not reflect the material and cultural improvements of indigenous peoples. In this essay we reflect on the little success of institutional policies of language, based on the paradigmatic evolution and the components (and their probable hierarchy) in the theory of the regulation of sociolinguistic changes. The omission or ignorance of these elements has generated a condition of inertia in the policies of the language.",

      "abstract": "REVIEWS 143 socially;but the analysistends towards building up an 'average'view within the parameters of Romanian affirmation rather than breaking down cases individually. The social and political contexts offered are too hasty and allusive, a problem exacerbated when the work is addressed at a foreign audience:thereis no attempt, for instance, to give the readerelementarydata about the lives of the authorsanalysed,or even referencesthereto.This means thatthe socialexplanationsMitu offersforthe appearanceof argumentsabout Romanianness are reduced to secondary generalizations, for instance on competition forpositionswithinthe Habsburgbureaucracy(p. 22); elsewhere, key tenets are dismissed as 'the outcome of a rudimentary process of stereotype-formation'(p. 202). This may indeed be the case, but it tells us perhaps less than we need to know about how these stereotypes actually function. So, for all the fine observations about the ideological implications and undertonesof a given statement,thereis a shortageof social contextualization and demonstrable explanation. Stress is laid on the social particularity of the Transylvanian situation; but after all, similar motifs such as nationalistposturingas response to foreign slander crop up in the writings of Romanians in the Principalities,not to mention those of other nations of the region. This suggeststhat the identity strategiesof the nineteenth century had a rather more oblique relationship with social finalities than the one suggestedby Mitu here. But these disagreements about the organization of the argument do not render Mitu's fundamentalresearch invalid. He has produced an excellently organized piece of work with a thorough bibliography(and an index, which the Romanian edition lacked).The translator,a non-native speaker,has done a valiantjob with a difficulttext, although the Romanian titles in the critical apparatusshouldhave been left in the original.

The revolutionaryeffectsof Napoleon's first great military campaign of I796 and the consequent I797 Treaty of Campo Formiowere dissolvedin the course of a year by the Vienna I8I4-15 settlement. Wiping a state like Venice off the map appeared easy enough. Militarilyit was, and the award to Austriaof so much of it certainlygave the French a more secure left flank in the eastern Mediterranean. Once the Egyptian adventure was over, however, matters of closer import led to no fewerthan fivemajorchanges involvingthe formerVenetianterritoriesbefore the post-Napoleonic peace got underway. Apart from the Ionian Islands, which were held not so snuglyunder Britishcontrol, the Venetian lands were reassembledunderAustriansovereignty,togetherwithwhathad, before I797, been the separate Lombardlands.

Dalmatia was, moreover, a place of true cross-currents,with Italian, Croatian, and Magyarelements combining with Austrianand Germaninfluences.

So much of the commercialandindustrialactivityconcomitantwiththeremaking of the Austriansystemof government constituteda 'catching-up',markedby an imperative need for infrastructuralharbour and road building. Yet the great truth was that the sailing ship, a scarcityof genuinely good roads, and an inadequate school system were perhaps three hugely vital features of the Dalmatian scene.Witha gargantuanbiographicalapparatusandan enormous and seemingly never-ending flow of detail making up this impressive and highly commendable volume, there is a distinct danger, not that we should missthe wood forthe trees,but thatwe shouldnot see the woods forthe forest, or maybe even fail to appreciate anything beyond it. Dalmatia's borders to the east are high and abrupt. For the period covered by this work, the lands beyond the north were often more readily reached by water than by land.

Produz-se, assim, padrões de comportamentos que transgridem as regras instituídas, forçando a presença, os valores e as demandas dos participantes nas diferentes esferas de vida em sociedade, assim como o reconhecimento de uma cultura política imbuída de ambiguidade, incerteza e risco, resultando num desempenho mais difuso das regras sociais e das instituições em geral. Social norms in the collective imagery Ruthy Nadia Laniado The direct collective actions of contemporary social movements and protests express more than simple demands or confrontations by the actors. They also expose a strong individualization related to values and modes of alternative behaviours which confront the established social system of consent and legality. Hence, they produce patterns of behaviour that transgress the accepted rules, asserting their presence, values and demands in the different spheres of life, as well as the acknowledgement of a political culture imbued with ambiguity, uncertainity and risk, yielding more dispersed social rules and unpredictable institucional performance at large.

      "title": "Social Attitudes of Field Instructors",
      "abstract": "Introduction As practitioners, social workers need to develop strong practice skills and be culturally competent to work effectively in cross-cultural settings. The Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) of Council on Social Work Education (CSWE, 2008) emphasizes that social workers should forms and mechanisms of oppression and discrimination; advocate for human rights and social and economic and engage in practices that advance social and economic justice (p. 5). The National Association of Social Workers (National Association of Social Workers, 2001, 2007a, 2007b) provides standards and guidance to deliver culturally competent social work services. However, despite social work professional standards for cultural competence, information and strategies to guide educators are often limited (Colvin-Burque, Davis-Maye, & Zugazaga, 2007).Both practicing social workers and students need to be aware of different forms of oppression and their own social attitudes that may influence their work with clients (Cross-Denny & Heyman, 2011). The field placement is a unique and critical component of social work education and facilitates students' development of competency in practice with diverse populations (Kadushin, 1991; Litvack, Mishna, & Bogo, 2010). Field instructors play a crucial role in educating social work students in field setting by preparing them to practice without discrimination. Therefore, field instructors must also have self-awareness of their own social attitudes. The purpose of this study is to examine attitudes of field instructors in training with respect to racial and women's equality, as well as their preparedness, experience, and education. Literature Review The EPAS (CSWE, 2008) focus on competency-based development for professional social work through 10 competencies with 41 corresponding practice behaviors. In accordance with Educational Policy 2.1.4 (CSWE, 2008) of engaging diversity and difference in practice, educational process for students incorporates understanding of difference and intersectionality of varying social identities that impacts a client's life experiences (Murphy, Hunt, Zajicek, Norris, & Hamilton, 2009). The NASW (2001) defines cultural competence as the integration and transformation of knowledge about individuals and groups of people into specific standards, policies, practices, and attitudes used in appropriate cultural settings to increase quality of services, thereby producing better outcomes (pp. 11-12). Through social work education, not only do students learn about and understand difference and develop cultural competency, but they also gain a deeper sense of their own worldviews and how their socialization process has impacted them.As signature pedagogy of social work education, field setting provides social work students with socialization to profession (Holden, Barker, Rosenberg, Kuppens, & Ferrell, 2011; Homonoff, 2008; Lyter, 2012; Miller, 2010, 2013; Shulman, 2005; Wayne, Bogo, & Raskin, 2010). The field instructor serves to model for students effective practice skills and behaviors and to instill values and attitudes of profession, including content on diversity and social (Barretti, 2007; CSWE, 2008; Mumm, 2006; Murdock, Ward, Ligon, & Jindani, 2006).According to Weiten (2001), attitudes can be defined as positive or negative evaluations of objects of thought (p. 670). The link between attitudes and behavior has been underscored in earlier studies (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Allport, 1935; LaPiere, 1934; Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960). Ponterotto, Potere, and Johansen (2002) describe social attitudes and discrimination in terms of negative behaviors towards certain social groups with underlying attitudes driving discriminatory behaviors. To assess social attitudes, Ponterrotto et al. …",

      "abstract": "Participation in community development is the key to promoting efficiency, accountability, and transparency in resource allocations for community development, resulting in fewer problems of social inequality. Many 'participatory' development projects, however, have not been successful in arousing participation among community members. In many such cases, cultural values and social norms are key barriers. Approaches developed with little understanding of local contexts may yield no incentive to participate. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanisms that may operate within certain cultural contexts remain under-researched to date. This study examines evidence from Thailand, using examples from communities that have been able to get people's participation despite a hindering culture of compliance to superiors. These examples suggest that the enabling mechanisms include three important factors: actor (self-esteem), action (engagement of community members throughout the development process), and alliance (management of roles, rules, and resolutions). This study contributes to knowledge about the socio-culturally embedded character of community development and suggests ways to promote participation based on an understanding of a specific context.",

      "title": "‘<b>¡</b>Eso no se dice’!: Exploring the value of communication distortions in participatory planning",
      "abstract": "Plans and policies rely on knowledge about communities that is often made by actors outside of the community. Exclusion from the creation of knowledge is a function of exclusion from power. Marxists, feminist, decolonial and postmodernist theorists have documented how the knowledge of some subjects is disqualified based on their gender, race, socio-economic position or a range of other constructed differences. Often, several of these constructions intersect in one person’s life, compounding their exclusion in ways that are both relational and structural ( Crenshaw, 2017 ). Participatory planning approaches bring members of the community into contact with planning authorities in an effort to include their voices and interests in official plans. Essential to meaningful engagement in such a process is the participant’s ability to turn their ideas into change through the exercise of their agency. When that potential for transformation is missing, participation is tokenistic at best and dangerous at worst ( Cooke and Kothari, 2001 , Hickey and Mohan, 2004 ; Forester, 2020 ). When planners ask people whose agency is restricted by institutional and cultural forms of subjugation to talk about issues that adversely impact them, but over which they have little control, we can create exposures to internal and external risks that we are ill-equipped to mitigate. How can planners work towards social transformation without shifting the burden of speaking truth to power onto community members? One of the ways in which power and knowledge are related is through the complicated process of communication. Reflecting on power and communication in planning practice, this paper contemplates the question: when working with communities that have been historically excluded from the creation of knowledge about themselves, should planners strive for undistorted communication or should the distortion in communication be analysed for what it can tell us about agency and power, and opportunities for resistance and transformation?",

Yet there are conditions under which cooperative behaviors do more harm than good, within and between groups. We review current research from a variety of social science disciplines exploring the oft‐unquestioned ironic effects of cooperative behavior and conversely, the value of social conflict for positive outcomes – e.g., increased creativity and moral behavior, and concrete social change and equity. Recent reviews of prejudice reduction interventions have shed light on the hazards of exclusively promoting positive attitudes and emotions within and between groups. In complement, we focus on cooperative and conflictual behavior and the consequences thereof. To highlight issues researchers and practitioners should consider when developing social interventions, we summarize some of the common ironic effects of cooperative and conflict behaviors. Cooperative behaviors are socially and economically beneficial across a large variety of contexts; however, universal prescriptions for such behaviors may have unintended negative effects, whereas conflict is often requisite for promoting progress.",

      "abstract": "A SOCIAL problem is a situation believed to be a threat to or an infringement upon an established social value and considered capable of amelioration or elimination by appropriate social action. A social problem has the following elements: (a) a situation capable of measurement; (b) a value believed threatened thereby; (c) a realization that the situation and the value may (theoretically) be reconciled by group action. These elements must all be present before the situation may be adjudged a social problem. The student of social problems should therefore maintain a healthy respect for a fact; he should understand the role of a social value; and he should realize the possibilities of constructive social action. Social problems are products of a dynamic society, in which behavior changes more rapidly than the values that define it. Societies exhibiting a consistent disparity between behavior and the values by which it is defined are in a state of (relative) social disorganization. Social problems and social disorganization are thus complementary ways of describing the same thing. We are interested here in those situations",

      "abstract": "A cognitive model of social influence (Social Sampling Theory [SST]) is developed and applied to several social network phenomena including polarization and contagion effects. Social norms and individuals' private attitudes are represented as distributions rather than the single points used in most models. SST is explored using agent-based modeling to link individual-level and network-level effects. People are assumed to observe the behavior of their social network neighbors and thereby infer the social distribution of particular attitudes and behaviors. It is assumed that (a) people dislike behaving in ways that are extreme within their neighborhood social norm (social extremeness aversion assumption), and hence tend to conform and (b) people prefer to behave consistently with their own underlying attitudes (authenticity preference assumption) hence minimizing dissonance. Expressed attitudes and behavior reflect a utility-maximizing compromise between these opposing principles. SST is applied to a number of social phenomena including (a) homophily and the development of segregated neighborhoods, (b) polarization, (c) effects of norm homogeneity on social conformity, (d) pluralistic ignorance and false consensus effects, (e) backfire effects, (f) interactions between world view and social norm effects, and (g) the opposing effects on subjective well-being of authentic behavior and high levels of social comparison. More generally, it is argued that explanations of social comparison require the variance, not just the central tendency, of both attitudes and beliefs about social norms to be accommodated.

Processes related to the identification, acquisition, development, dissemination, use and retention of knowledge relevant to local development are closely linked to the resolution of problems related to nutrition, housing, health, local identity, and care of the environment among others. These problems are complex due to their interdependence and therefore their study demands integrative and interdisciplinary approaches in which conceivable solutions depend on the promotion of activities that incen­tivize rational dialogues based on both existing and acquired knowledge, thereby promoting social appropriation and local human welfare. These ideas lead us to, once again, weigh the role of community as a quality in local development processes, understanding that within these processes identity, and everything associated with it, is essential. Knowledge man­agement is a social process that depends on a pertinent interpretation of the sociocultural characteristics of each place in order to be effective.",

The skills young people are expected to master, the kinds of choices they must make, and the settings they negotiate during the adolescent years are prescribed by social institutions (e.g., the educational system) and by shared expectations concerning the requirements for success in adulthood (Crockett, 1997). Social change, which entails large-scale alterations in ideological, technological, and economic systems within societies, has significant implications for adolescent development. For example, social change can affect the structure and dynamics of social contexts that adolescents experience on a daily basis such as family, school, and youth groups. It can also alter the social institutions and cultural belief systems that organize the adolescent period.",

Social action can be divided into: instrumental -rational actions, value -rational actions, traditional actions and affective action.The marketing of social activities must be fulfilled: the research of needs for products of social activities, the development of suitable products of social activities to satisfy the needs and the creation of a favorable image.Social marketing can be understood in two ways: as a marketing applied to non-profit entities, ie to subjects of social activity, and as marketing applied by society, its institutions and associations. The ultimate goal of social marketing is the development of an individual, a member of a concrete society that is achieved through education, culture, healthcare and the activities of charities or political parties.Social changes are largely uncontrolled, they may have special features such as: direction, intensity and speed.

      "abstract": "An animal's habitat is filled with places that support activities in daily life. There are places, for example, that afford sleeping, eating, hiding, and gathering with others. Most places reflect the environment's nested structure. Even as perception–action is coupled to structure at the level of affordances, it is also coupled especially in human societies to dynamic structures at the level of places within which affordances are nested. These places have a distinctive complexity arising from the collective actions of individuals. For this reason, place-specific activities in human habitats are nearly always embedded in collective social practices. If children are to function adaptively as social beings in the community where they develop and live from day to day, they must learn not only where such places are located but also and critically how to participate in them. Owing to shared intersubjective intentions that give rise to places as behavior settings, individuals' actions in community settings are normatively constrained in the course of their participating in those settings. Consideration of the place within which perception–action is nested is indispensable if we hope to attain an adequate understanding of human perception–action in community settings as well as in some of the settings where research is conducted.",

Schwartzman 1989: 7, 61, 274–275); it has clearly marked boundaries in time (beginning and end are officially announced) and space (a spatial environment of mutual monitoring possibilities). These boundaries partially suspend the social structures of the meeting's environment, thus creating a relatively autonomous unit of social life. The meeting develops its own structures which both enable and constrain the interactions of the participants. These structures include the sequential organization of meeting talk (turn‐taking) and topics (agenda), the need to be relevant with regard to the current topic, procedural rules, as well as a number of functional roles related to the maintenance of the meeting itself, usually including the role of a facilitator. These structures are culturally contingent and social movements often develop their own specific meeting culture which—consciously or unconsciously—reflects much of the movement's identity and the goals for which it strives.",

      "abstract": "At the core of the new approaches to verbal interaction lies the idea of intersubjectivity placing a great emphasis on the creation of social relations. Interaction implies not only following particular conventional principles or some discursive strategies, but also adopting certain social behaviours. In 1975 Grice mentioned in his article Logic and Conversation about the existence of moral, aesthetic and social rules which all fall into the principle of politeness: “Be polite!” Brown Levinson (Politeness. Some Universals in Language Usage, 1987) developed a theory of politeness having as starting point Gofman’s concept of the face (The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, 1956). The interactants have to spare or to protect the positive and/or negative faces within the verbal communication, since the presence of FTA (Face Threatening Acts) leads to the application of certain strategies in order to avoid this threat. The Facework consists of a series of procedures at the interactants’ disposal meant to save these faces. Interactants resort to different indirect forms of expressions that can help the process of conversation. Having in mind that the non-verbal aspects and the social context are essential in defining the Facework, we try in our paper to show that certain linguistic phenomena (such as Indirect Speech Acts, the apologies, the implicit, etc) are tightly connected with the management of interpersonal relationships.",

For the purposes of this paper, social welfare is defined as those public programs designed to provide an individual who is in financial need with the resources (financial and/or in kind) to exist in our society. Social control refers to the entire range of actions and pressures which are designed to lead the individual to function within society without threatening to disrupt the social order. These actions and pressures are embodied in sanctions for enforcing group norms as well as in formal sanctions formulated through laws or administrative rulings. The sanctions are physical, material and/or symbolic [Etzioni, 1964]. Coercive refers to situations in which individuals either have no viable options available to them in making decisions or are required to conform to a specific classification or perform specific actions or desist from specific actions in order to obtain that which is an entitlement to resources and/or services. Kallen contends that coercion obtains whenever the action or thought of one individual or group is compelled or restrained by another through some form of physical or moral compulsion [Kallen, 1933]. There can be little doubt that the action of welfare recipients are frequently compelled or restrained through physical means, i.e., the level of assistance; and moral compulsions, t.e., the myths which define them as inferior.",

Or do we take also into account the evolution of pluriethnic societies where the demands and conception are deeply different ? Second, the various systems of social regulation progressively resign their function, while the children's and especially the adolescents' demand can be summarized in these terms : I need self-government. At school, solving problems of physics or mathematics are more praised than solving problems of social relationship. Third, we must admit the emergence of precocious antisocial behavior, the importance of social desillusion in adolescence, as well as the demands expressed by the means of what we could call a delinquency of debt.",

      "title": "Cultural Presence",
      "abstract": "In many text-based virtual communities, confusion exists between the notion of social presence and cultural presence. While social presence may be evident in these communities, cultural presence may require more than dialogue or persistent world data (that is, backed up by off-line databases and retrievable after by online sessions). It is also not clear how much cultural presence is available in three-dimensional online games and role-playing environments. While they may have a great deal of social presence, these environments typically provide for instrumental learning that develops understanding of the design rules of the virtual environment, not the embedded and embodied social rules and individual beliefs of the participants as a community. In the case of virtual history and heritage environments, it appears that we do not understand cultural information and how to provide for it or communicate it digitally. Virtual heritage environments are a good example of this lack of meaningful interaction (Mosaker, 2000; Schroeder, 1996, p. 115). Apart from such isolated examples as Blaxxun’s The Renaissance project or VRoma (“A virtual community for teaching and learning classics”), one may well wonder whether these environments are communities at all. People intending to travel to a heritage site may have different requirements to people just exploring a virtual world. People may want to use virtual technology in different ways: to use the information as a travel guide; to imagine, explore, or understand the past; or to meet and socially participate with other people. Virtual environments that would be helped by a sense of cultural presence could be virtual communities, language and social exchange sites, virtual travel and tourism sites, or virtual heritage sites.",

It should be an important part of language assessment literacy (LAL) for test makers. In fact, we should be deeply questioning those who wish to evaluate a solitary mind without its connections to useful devises, contexts, and people (e.g. tools, places, and social groups) (Murphey, 2003, 2012, 2019a, 2019b). When we work in our daily lives, we will need to use such devises and affordances, as well as the people around us, and we must know how to contextualize our understandings, act (ask), and access our social resources in order to do a good job. Our global testing system is fundamentally wrong, archaic, and counter to what most of us will be doing for the rest of our lives if we are smart: connecting with others and a variety of data bases and asking for help socially, as needed. This is especially important for LAL of both teachers and students and calls for more training of assessment design (Lewis, 2019).",

Although little leisure behavior research has been conducted specifically to examine social leisure, accumulated evidence indicates that social involvement is both a primary leisure activity, as well as a motivation for involvement in other leisure activities. Social skills are necessary to facilitate positive social interaction. Deficits in social skills are common in many populations served by therapeutic recreation. These individuals need assistance in the development of social skills in order to experience a more satisfying leisure lifestyle. Within therapeutic recreation, social skill development plays an important role in therapy, leisure education and recreation participation services.

Mais, si faire des efforts semble « aller de soi », en donner une definition parait moins evident et laisse emerger une pluralite de points de vue. L’exemple particulier de l’effort sportif en atteste aisement. En effet, a priori souvent considere comme une question purement energetique, il constitue a vrai dire un construit social aux connotations morales tres fortes. A travers les qualifications de l’effort sportif s’expriment ainsi differentes significations sociales. Savoir « se depasser » constitue, par exemple, autant une competence sportive qu’une maniere d’exprimer sa singularite ou de justifier sa promotion sociale. Ces designations depassent, par consequent, la seule problematique sportive pour atteindre des enjeux d’integration et de reconnaissance sociales. La comprehension de ces enjeux passe par leur mise en perspective avec les caracteristiques socioculturelles des individus. La precocite de pratique ou l’engagement en competition representent ainsi des elements « structurants ». En prenant appui sur la theorie du social telle que l’a formalisee P. Bourdieu, l’article propose de montrer le poids de l’histoire de l’individu dans l’acte de designation. A partir de l’etude des recits de sportifs, nous mettrons en evidence l’influence des dispositions sociales dans l’acte de designer l’effort sportif.",

      "abstract": "The development of human-dimension systems (e.g. «human–technique»systems) is supposed to play the most important role in the further evolution of society in the context of informatization. However, the risk-generating potential of these systems significantly exceeds the risks of socio-technical systems characteristic of industrial society due to the exponentially rapid development of so-called «dangerous knowledge». On the one hand, information technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for human creativity. On the other hand, a significant majority of people still use them as passive consumers. They are ready to automate not only some aspects of professional activity but also interpersonal interactions, i.e. a conscious component of social relations. This means that we are losing consciousness of individual life and social processes. We are less and less willing to make reflexive efforts. This leads to a «virtual objectification» of person, a loss of identity, reduces person to the state of an element of the network mechanism, unwilling and unable to deeply understand and comprehend social relations. «Artificial virtuality» displaces the «natural virtuality» of individual and social consciousness. Since in the current sociocultural context, information technology can destroy a person’s capacity for such understanding and comprehension, we consider knowledge associated with information technology to be potentially «dangerous». We see a response to this challenge in the following. Firstly, it is necessary to develop a scientific concept of consciousness as essentially autonomous and not reducible to its material foundations. Secondly, education should be developed in the direction of «Writing and Thinking» technology, which forms the competence of reflective, critical and systematic thinking.",

La actual investigación buscó comprender mejor las condiciones de generalización de disposiciones morales en diferentes tipos de agrupaciones de individuos. A lo largo de dos estudios (n = 180), y mediante un paradigma de generalización inductiva, se indagó la manera como niños de cinco y siete años de edad generalizan disposiciones morales, variando las características de los grupos sociales presentados. Los resultados mostraron que los niños no utilizan únicamente la presencia de etiquetas verbales comunes entre los miembros para guiar la generalización; por el contrario, este proceso parece más restringido, en función de las características observadas del grupo social. Estos hallazgos revelan que la identificación de disposiciones morales y su generalización en los individuos de un grupo social es un proceso de emergencia relativamente temprana en el desarrollo y de naturaleza compleja.",

Yet, the idea of mutual relationships, the best outcome for the client to function in his/her family and his/her society, a just, fair and supportive society in which to live are concepts as old as social work itself and still of importance today. Recovery, well-being and social justice are emerging issues for each generation of people with mental health concerns. The issues of those who suffer mental illness are about their own functioning, their relationships with loved ones and their community and their ability to gain some control over what may often be a fairly chaotic life. Workers who can ensure that the sufferers can have hope, meaning and purpose as they live their life are what they want.\r\n\r\nNot all emerging issues are new. In many ways, any discussion of emerging issues for social work practice is going to go over old ground. The issues that have been discussed in the past are still prevalent. For example, 'Mental health problems account for a large proportion of the disease burden among young people in all societies' (UNICEF 2011: 27) and 'health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental disorders; as a consequence, the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is large all over the world' (WHO 2013: 5). The incidence of mental health issues and an inadequate response have been, are, and will continue to be emerging issues for social work practice. In that sense, old issues are also emerging issues.",

      "abstract": "A group is conceptualized as a system with three universal subsystems on which any ongoing group depends. The subsystems are bases – necessary for group “functioning” and performance in more or less coherent ways; a group may be able to realize – with its bases in particular contexts -- not only its purposes or goals but system requisites to sustain the group. The group bases consist of: (1) a rule regime (collective culture with a finite set of rule categories) defining group identity and purpose, defining and regulating roles and role relationships, norms and behavioral outputs, its collectively shared places and times for gathering and interacting; (2) an agential base of group members who are socialized (or partially socialized) carriers of and adherents to the group’s identity and rule regime; involvement factors motivate members to adhere to and implement the rule regime; (3) a resource base, technologies and materials, self-produced and/or obtained from the environment -- essential to group functioning and group performances. Group multiple production processes (based on sub-complexes in its rule regime) impact on the group itself (reflexivity) and on its environment. These outputs, among other things, maintain-adapt-develop the group bases (or, possibly, unintentionally undermine/destroy them). Thus, groups are action systems producing goods-services-experiences-events- developments, etc. for themselves and (possibly) for the larger environment on which they depend for goods&services- resources-recruits-legitimation, etc. The model provides a single framework for the systematic descriptions and comparative analysis of a wide diversity of groups, several of which serve as illustrations in the paper.",

      "abstract": "Reciprocity is treating other people as other people treat you, voluntarily and not as a result of a binding exchange agreement. It concerns acts, attitudes or sentiments, and the tradition of social science restricts the term to favourable items (to which revenge and retaliation are only very partially symmetrical, as we shall see). When reciprocity is not the whole of a social relation – as with returning a favour, or liking people who like you –, it is generally a part of it, often necessary for the rest. For instance, a free, peaceful and efficient society requires the mutual respect of persons and properties – the police and self-defence could not suffice and are costly – and people would or could not so respect others if they were not themselves respected. This permits, in particular, the working of markets and organizations, which also requires a minimum of trust, honesty, promise keeping, or fairness – and mutual help in organizations –, which can only be reciprocal. These latter reciprocities palliate difficulties in information and coercion (in particular, they provide the main correctors of market failures). Communities of all kinds imply reciprocities of mutual help among their members and, often, between each member and the community as such. In particular, a family is primarily an intense reciprocity of services and affection. The political and public sector includes various relations of reciprocity, and the regimes known as “welfare states” add a few important ones concerning aid, health, pensions, and education.",

      "abstract": "Social work is a profession that began its life as a call to help the poor, the destitute, and the disenfranchised of a rapidly changing social order. It continues today still pursuing that quest, perhaps with some occasional deviations of direction from the original spirit. Social work practice is the primary means of achieving the profession’s ends. It is impossible to overstate the centrality or the importance of social work practice to the profession of social work. Much of what is important about the history of the profession is the history of social work practice. The profession must consider both social work practice per se (the knowledge base, practice theories, and techniques) and the context for social work practice. The context of practice includes the agency setting, the policy framework, and the large social system in which practice takes place. Social work practice is created within a political, social, cultural, and economic matrix that shapes the assumptions of practice, the problems that practice must deal with, and the preferred outcomes of practice. Over time, the base forces that create practice and create the context for practice, change. Since the social order changes over time, practice created at one point in time may no longer be appropriate in the future. It is also true that social work, and social work practice, can differ from society to society.",

People are motivated to join social movements to fulfil their need for social acceptance. They are more likely to become involved in social change following a depletion in their social acceptance and if they possess personality traits related to an increased desire for social acceptance. Social identity can also affect social change, specifically through the mechanism of social acceptance. People who feel a stronger sense of identity with their group, those who are more accepted, are more likely to be participants in social change movements. Finally, social acceptance seems to directly impact people's participation in social change. Making someone feel accepted, through social affirming language or social media use, increases their participation in social change. Ultimately, there are a multitude of ways in which social acceptance increases social change.",

Findings: concerning categories: approaching the other, authority figure, teacher’s metaphor, the teacher at the window, practices which evidence approaches of conflictive situations that are limited when providing a proper solution for them. Conclusions : there are hegemonic imaginaries at school from which the coexistence is approached based mainly on authority, surveillance, repression, order and discipline as control mechanisms.

      "title": "On the Methodology Applied",
      "abstract": "Methodology development in social policy science has traditionally, so far, been rather neglected compared to e.g. other social sciences. Every science discipline has to work on not just borrowing or importing methods from other neighboring disciplines, or from far and wide, but also develop discipline-specific methodology, i.e. an array of discipline-specific methods (cf. Aspalter 2021c; for trans-disciplinary learning for the development of discipline-specific methods cf. e.g. Tobi and Kampen 2018; Leblanc 2009). As it turned out, for this book, and in the run up to the book, a number of new specific methods have been (had to be) constructed and/or developed further. It is important to mention them, and to give social policy a chance to form its own consciousness towards setting up social policy-specific methods and methodological approaches, that not only lead to better results, more breakthroughs, but also help to make this world a better place.",

      "abstract": "In its multiple-meaning, the word “program “ is widely penetrating in the field of social life and is also understood as a list, index, notes (of theatre, concert performances, performed roles, and their performers, in radio and television broadcasts, of authors of reports, scientific conferences, and symposia), etc. Namely, the potential range of application of that term is the grounds for transferring its general meaning upon wider and wider fields of applicability, within which frames to define its aspect meaning and content. For the aims of our study, we determine the term “program” in the aspect of a particular public activity, what social activity is. We use the concept “social program” in this sense, which definition finds manifestation in several aspects: The social program is a perspective concept for the growth of wealth and development of social relations. Social programs appear to be special sections of the economic and social development plans (yearly or for a longer period) of the corresponding planning regions, districts, and municipalities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Loneliness and social isolation are widely recognized as one of the most important and deep-rooted problems facing society, with special impact on people who are immersed in processes of social exclusion. The study examined the relationship between loneliness and social exclusion in residential centers. It used phenomenological interviews (N = 11) to explore the subjective experiences of loneliness among people in residential centers for social inclusion to determine the variables associated with their emergence and development, as well as the factors aggravating or alleviating the influence of loneliness on their lives. The results yielded five themes associated with the loneliness of residents, with an interweaving of different axes of exclusion: (1) loneliness and unfulfilled need for meaningful relationships; (2) family losses and conflicts; (3) the experiences of homelessness and residential centers; (4) the economic dependence, contribution, and social inclusion; and (5) the loneliness associated with marginalization and social stigma. Authors present the implications of these findings on social work and some lines of psychosocial intervention.",

      "abstract": "Most aspects of mental illness and psychological well-being are influenced by social factors (such as gender, social class, race and ethnicity, and household patterns) and social institutions (such as disability and social security systems, labor markets, and health care organizations). The capacity to cope effectively with growing numbers of persons with mental illness and/or dementia depend substantially on the social arrangements affecting family, work, income support and medical care. The epidemiology of mental illness in later life is complicated by the relationships among symptom occurrence, drug use, and physical illness and the varying ways individuals and families define illness, evaluate its significance and take remedial action. Age cohorts and varying ethnic groups, respond differently in recognizing psychological symptoms, in perceptions of stigma and in willingness to seek help. With aging of the population, the cumulative burdens of mental illness are increasing in most societies. Such burdens depend not only on the magnitude of dementia, depression, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses but the types of social supports and institutional arrangements that help to insulate individuals, families and communities from the most disruptive stresses and facilitate functioning.",

In either case, no one expects employers to hire employees out of charity or respect; they are hired for their usefulness to the organization. Particularly in the face of competitive pressures and a changing environment, workplaces are commonly sites of insecurity, domination, overweening ambition and competitiveness, status seeking, callousness, strategizing, and dissembling ( Jackall 1988). They may also be sites of prejudice, discrimination, bullying, and harassment. Yet at the same time one may flnd sociability, moral concern, the pursuit and granting of esteem and respect, concern for justice, gift exchanges, commitments to causes, projects and people, and intrinsic satisfaction in work and its effects.",

      "abstract": "All social formations are only relatively enduring, which is as true for those of modernity as any other. As their constitution and composition changes, so do the extensiveness, scope and significance of agential reflexivity. Reflexivity is defined as 'the regular exercise of the mental ability, shared by all normal people, to consider themselves in relation to their (social) contexts and vice versa'.1 As such, it is the process through which reasons become causes of the courses of action adopted by social subjects. Their subjective internal deliberations – internal conversations – are responsible for mediating the conditional influence of objective structural and cultural factors upon social action.2 Although I maintain that reflexivity is indispensable in any social formation, it does not follow that its properties, powers or its mode of practice remain unchanging. On the contrary, reflexivity has a history – a long one – and it has a future of increasing social importance (particularly for conflict, citizenship and civil society).",

      "title": "Connectedness and Citizenship: Redefining Social Integration",
      "abstract": "Despite decades of deinstitutionalization, individuals with psychiatric disabilities living outside the hospital may be described as in the community, but not of it. To effectively address the persisting problem of social exclusion of persons with psychiatric disabilities, new conceptual tools are needed. To address this need, a new definition of social integration is offered.The definition is based on data from a qualitative study. Data collection consisted of individual, unstructured interviews with 56 adults who have been psychiatrically disabled (N=78 interviews) as well as ethnographic visits to five service sites working to promote social integration for their users (N=8 visits). An interpretive approach was used to analyze the data.Social integration is defined as a process, unfolding over time, through which individuals who have been psychiatrically disabled increasingly develop and exercise their capacities for connectedness and citizenship. Connectedness denotes the construction and successful maintenance of reciprocal interpersonal relationships. Social, moral, and emotional competencies are required to sustain connectedness. Citizenship refers to the rights and privileges enjoyed by members of a democratic society and to the responsibilities these rights engender. The definition calls for full rights and responsibilities of citizenship.The new definition sets an ideal, but not unrealistic, standard for social integration in the context of psychiatric disability. High standards encourage mental health professionals and policy makers to rethink what is possible for mental health services and to raise expectations for connectedness and citizenship among persons once disabled by mental illness.",

      "title": "PLURALISM OF MORALITY INHERENT REQUIREMENTS INTERPRETATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY",
      "abstract": "The research focuses on the basic theoretical and practical aspects of legal norms enforcement in terms of pluralism of interpretation of inherent requirements of law enforcer’s morality. The analysis of morality as a society social regulator has been provided through the prism of its social differentiation. Moreover, moral principles of the person depend on the level of needs (under A. Maslow’s pyramid of needs) where a person`s activity is directed. Although, a person’s ability to meet the requirements of a certain level depends more or less on the person’s age, intellectual level, their residential area, religion, financial standing and their role in working process organization etc. The factors under consideration in terms of the formation of individual’s moral consciousness depends are the following: social background, national and cultural traditions, certain conditions of personality formation (family, school, the closest environment), urbanization, individual and social experience (including professional– e.g. the difference between moral assessments of local court judges and the Supreme Court of Ukrainian Justices), the sphere of activity, religiousness, influence of public opinion and mass media, age factors, differences in needs and interests etc. In Ukraine, there are a lot of law enforcement subjects providing a moral assessment in their activity. Some of these subjects’ powers intersect each other so that in some cases they pass different (even opposite) decisions concerning the same object of moral assessment. The practice of Ukrainian legislation application is analyzed in terms of differences in the application of the same legal norm because of a different understanding of morality requirements. The pluralism of morality requirements understanding during law enforcement by the bodies of state power belonging to the same sphere has been demonstrated. For this purpose, the judicial practice has been analyzed as well. The position of the courts as to what should be considered as immoral offense while applying the legal norm which foresees dismissing of an employee because of committing the immoral offense inconsistent with work continuance is established to be different. Some of the judicial decisions in the analyzed cases are based on the fact whether the participation of a pedagogical worker in a fight is an immoral offense. Different views of judges on this issue caused different material law norm enforcement. It has been justified that the understanding of morality during law applying in socially heterogeneous society can be expressed in two ways: law enforcers on the same hierarchy level apply the legal norm differently that specifies the necessity of case circumstances for moral assessment on the basis of their different understanding of the morality requirements; law enforcement subject within own competence cancels the law enforcing act of another law enforcement subject, being guided by another understanding of morality requirements (for example a court repeals the law enforcement act of another body or court of the higher instance repeals the decision of the lower instance court).",

      "abstract": "Research on the experience of international students often suffers from conflation, in that it uses culture (or nationality as a proxy for culture) as a categorising agent, thereby granting causal powers to cultural differences, and contributing to a deficit model of international students. In this research, I will argue that, while culture and structure both provide new sets of constraints and opportunities for international students, participants are active agents in shaping their own experiences, as they think, reflect and act in response to their situational context. Drawing on Archer’s concept of reflexivity, this thesis demonstrates that because international students are often not immediately able to exercise agency through conversation (thought and talk), they find a need to reflect on their experiences and develop a course of action based on greater autonomy (that is, they become more independent). However, while some students make the transition to independence relatively smoothly, for others, it is not so easy, and some participants may find it difficult to convert thoughts into effective action (or displaced reflexivity). Participants in the international student experience confront a situational context marked by four specific features: first, a lack of a sympathetic interlocutor (that is, they find themselves on their own); second, contextual incongruity (commonly conceptualised as culture shock); third, shared experiences, which leads to congruity; and fourth, troublesome events, which blocks agential action. This research provides empirical evidence of specific generative mechanisms which contribute to the shaping of agency in the international student experience.",

      "title": "Beyond Braille on Toilet Doors: Museum Curators and Audiences with Vision Impairment",
      "abstract": "The debate on the social role of museums trundles along in an age where complex associations between community, collections, and cultural norms are highly contested (Silverman 3–4; Sandell, Inequality 3–23). This article questions whether, in the case of community groups whose aspirations often go unrecognised (in this case people with either blindness or low vision), there is a need to discuss and debate institutionalised approaches that often reinforce social exclusion and impede cultural access. If “access is [indeed] an entry point to experience” (Papalia), then the privileging of visual encounters in museums is clearly a barrier for people who experience sight loss or low vision (Levent and Pursley). In contrast, a multisensory aesthetic to exhibition display respects the gamut of human sensory experience (Dudley 161–63; Drobnick 268–69; Feld 184; James 136; McGlone 41–60) as do discursive gateways including “lectures, symposia, workshops, educational programs, audio guides, and websites” (Cachia). Independent access to information extends beyond Braille on toilet doors.Underpinning this article is an ongoing qualitative case study undertaken by the author involving participant observation, workshops, and interviews with eight adults who experience vision impairment. The primary research site has been the National Museum of Australia. Reflecting on the role of curators as storytellers and the historical development of museums and their practitioners as agents for social development, the article explores the opportunities latent in museum collections as they relate to community members with vision impairment. The outcomes of this investigation offer insights into emerging issues as they relate to the International Council of Museums (ICOM) definitions of the museum program. Curators as Storytellers“The ways in which objects are selected, put together, and written or spoken about have political effects” (Eilean Hooper-Greenhill qtd. in Sandell, Inequality 8). Curators can therefore open or close doors to discrete communities of people. The traditional role of curators has been to collect, care for, research, and interpret collections (Desvallées and Mairesse 68): they are characterised as information specialists with a penchant for research (Belcher 78). While commonly possessing an intimate knowledge of their institution’s collection, their mode of knowledge production results from a culturally mediated process which ensures that resulting products, such as cultural significance assessments and provenance determinations (Russell and Winkworth), privilege the knowing systems of dominant social groups (Fleming 213). Such ways of seeing can obstruct the access prospects of underserved audiences.When it comes to exhibition display—arguably the most public of work by museums—curators conventionally collaborate within a constellation of other practitioners (Belcher 78–79). Curators liaise with museum directors, converse with conservators, negotiate with exhibition designers, consult with graphics designers, confer with marketing boffins, seek advice from security, chat with editors, and engage with external contractors. I question the extent that curators engage with community groups who may harbour aspirations to participate in the exhibition experience—a sticking point soon to be addressed. Despite the team based ethos of exhibition design, it is nonetheless the content knowledge of curators on public display. The art of curatorial interpretation sets out not to instruct audiences but, in part, to provoke a response with narratives designed to reveal meanings and relationships (Freeman Tilden qtd. in Alexander and Alexander 258). Recognised within the institution as experts (Sandell, Inclusion 53), curators have agency—they decide upon the stories told. In a recent television campaign by the National Museum of Australia, a voiceover announces: a storyteller holds incredible power to connect and to heal, because stories bring us together (emphasis added). (National Museum of Australia 2015)Storytelling in the space of the museum often shares the histories, perspectives, and experiences of people past as well as living cultures—and these stories are situated in space and time. If that physical space is not fit-for-purpose—that is, it does not accommodate an individual’s physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory, or neurological needs (Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Cwlth)—then the story reaches only long-established patrons. The museum’s opportunity to contribute to social development, and thus the curator’s as the primary storyteller, will have been missed. A Latin-American PerspectiveICOM’s commitment to social development could be interpreted merely as a pledge to make use of collections to benefit the public through scholarship, learning, and pleasure (ICOM 15). If this interpretation is accepted, however, then any museum’s contribution to social development is somewhat paltry. To accept such a limited and limiting role for museums is to overlook the historical efforts by advocates to change the very nature of museums. The ascendancy of the social potential of museums first blossomed during the late 1960s at a time where, globally, overlapping social movements espoused civil rights and the recognition of minority groups (Silverman 12; de Varine 3). Simultaneously but independently, neighbourhood museums arose in the United States, ecomuseums in France and Quebec, and the integral museum in Latin America, notably in Mexico (Hauenschild; Silverman 12–13). The Latin-American commitment to the ideals of the integral museum developed out of the 1972 round table of Santiago, Chile, sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Giménez-Cassina 25–26). The Latin-American signatories urged the local and regional museums of their respective countries to collaborate with their communities to resolve issues of social inequality (Round Table Santiago 13–21). The influence of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire should be acknowledged. In 1970, Freire ushered in the concept of conscientization, defined by Catherine Campbell and Sandra Jovchelovitch as:the process whereby critical thinking develops … [and results in a] … thinker [who] feels empowered to think and to act on the conditions that shape her living. (259–260)This model for empowerment lent inspiration to the ideals of the Santiago signatories in realising their sociopolitical goal of the integral museum (Assunção dos Santos 20). Reframing the museum as an institution in the service of society, the champions of the integral museum sought to redefine the thinking and practices of museums and their practitioners (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 37–39). The signatories successfully lobbied ICOM to introduce an explicitly social purpose to the work of museums (Assunção dos Santos 6). In 1974, in the wake of the Santiago round table, ICOM modified their definition of a museum to “a permanent non-profit institution, open to the public, in the service of society and its development” (emphasis added) (Hauenschild). Museums had been transformed into “problem solvers” (Judite Primo qtd. in Giménez-Cassina 26). With that spirit in mind, museum practitioners, including curators, can develop opportunities for reciprocity with the many faces of the public (Guarini). Response to Social Development InitiativesStarting in the 1970s, the “second museum revolution” (van Mensch 6–7) saw the transition away from: traditional roles of museums [of] collecting, conservation, curatorship, research and communication … [and toward the] … potential role of museums in society, in education and cultural action. (van Mensch 6–7)Arguably, this potential remains a work in progress some 50 years later. Writing in the tradition of museums as agents of social development, Mariana Lamas states:when we talk about “in the service of society and its development”, it’s quite different. It is like the drunk uncle at the Christmas party that the family pretends is not there, because if they pretend long enough, he might pass out on the couch. (Lamas 47–48)That is not to say that museums have neglected to initiate services and programs that acknowledge the aspirations of people with disabilities (refer to Cachia and Krantz as examples). Without discounting such efforts, but with the refreshing analogy of the drunken uncle still fresh in memory, Lamas answers her own rhetorical question:how can traditional museums promote community development? At first the word “development” may seem too much for the museum to do, but there are several ways a museum can promote community development. (Lamas 52) Legitimising CommunitiesThe first way that museums can foster community or social development is to:help the community to over come [sic] a problem, coming up with different solutions, putting things into a new perspective; providing confidence to the community and legitimizing it. (Lamas 52)As a response, my doctoral investigation legitimises the right of people with vision impairment to participate in the social and cultural aspects of publicly funded museums. The Australian Government upheld this right in 2008 by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (and Optional Protocol), which enshrines the right of people with disability to participate in the cultural life of the nation (United Nations).At least 840,700 people in Australia (a minimum of four per cent of the population) experiences either blindness or low vision (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009). For every one person in the Australian community who is blind, nearly five other people experience low vision. The medical model of disability identifies the impairment as the key feature of a person and seeks out a corrective intervention. In contrast, the social model of disability strives to remove the attitudinal, social, and physical barriers enacted by people or institutions (Landman, Fishburn, and Tonkin 14). Therein lies the opportunity and challenge for museums—modifying layouts and practices that privilege the visual. Consequently, there is scope for museums to partner with people with vision impairment to identify their aspirations rather than respond as a problem to be fixed. Common fixes in the museums for people with disabilities include physical alterations such as ramps and, less often, special tours (Cachia). I posit that curators, as co-creators and major contributors to exhibitions, can be part of a far wider discussion. In the course of doctoral research, I accompanied adults with a wide array of sight impairments into exhibitions at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial, and the National Museum of Australia. Within the space of the exhibition, the most commonly identified barrier has been the omission of access opportunities to interpreted materials: that is, information about objects on display as well as the wider narratives driving exhibitions. Often, the participant has had to work backwards, from the object itself, to understand the wider topic of the exhibition. If aesthetics is “the way we communicate through the senses” (Thrift 291), then the vast majority of exhibits have been inaccessible from a sensory perspective. For people with low vision (that is, they retain some degree of functioning sight), objects’ labels have often been too small to be read or, at times, poorly contrasted or positioned. Objects have often been set too deep into display cabinets or too far behind safety barriers. If individuals must use personal magnifiers to read text or look in vain at objects, then that is an indicator that there are issues with exhibition design. For people who experience blindness (that is, they cannot see), neither the vast majority of exhibits nor their interpretations have been made accessible. There has been minimal access across all museums to accessioned objects, handling collections, or replicas to tease out exhibits and their stories. Object labels must be read by family or friends—a tiring experience. Without motivated peers, the stories told by curators are silenced by a dearth of alternative options.Rather than presume to know what works for people with disabilities, my research ethos respects the “nothing about us without us” (Charlton 2000; Werner 1997) maxim of disability advocates. To paraphrase Lamas, we have collaborated to come up with different solutions by putting things into new perspectives. In turn, “person-centred” practices based on rapport, warmth, and respect (Arigho 206–07) provide confidence to a diverse community of people by legitimising their right to participate in the museum space. Incentivising Communities Museums can also nurture social or community development by providing incentives to “the community to take action to improve its quality of life” (Lamas 52). It typically falls to (enthusiastic) public education and community outreach teams to engage underserved communities through targeted programs. This approach continues the trend of curators as advocates for the collection, and educators as advocates for the public (Kaitavouri xi). If the exhibition briefs normally written by curators (Belcher 83) reinforced the importance of access, then exhibition designers would be compelled to offer fit-for-purpose solutions. Better still, if curators (and other exhibition team members) regularly met with community based organisations (perhaps in the form of a disability reference group), then museums would be better positioned to accommodate a wider spectrum of community members. The National Standards for Australian Museums and Galleries already encourages museums to collaborate with disability organisations (40). Such initiatives offer a way forward for improving a community’s sense of itself and its quality of life. The World Health Organization defines health as a “state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. While I am not using quality of life indicators for my doctoral study, the value of facilitating social and cultural opportunities for my target audience is evident in participant statements. At the conclusion of one sensory based workshop, Mara, a female participant who experiences low vision in one eye and blindness in the other, stated:I think it was interesting in that we could talk together about what we were experiencing and that really is the social aspect of it. I mean if I was left to go to a whole lot of museums on my own, I probably wouldn’t. You know, I like going with kids or a friend visiting from interstate—that sort of thing. And so this group, in a way, replicates that experience in that you’ve got someone else to talk about your impressions with—much better than going on your own or doing this alone.Mara’s statement was in response to one of two workshops I held with the support of the Learning Services team at the National Museum of Australia in May 2015. Selected objects from the museum’s accessioned collection and handling collection were explored, as well as replicas in the form of 3D printed objects. For example, participants gazed upon and handled a tuckerbox, smelt and tasted macadamia nuts in wattle seed syrup, and listened to a genesis story about the more-ish nut recorded by the Butchulla people—the traditional owners of Fraser Island. We sat around a table while I, as the workshop mediator, sought to facilitate free-flowing discussions about their experiences and, in turn, mused on the capacity of objects to spark social connection and opportunities for cultural access. While the workshop provided the opportunity for reciprocal exchanges amongst participants as well as between participants and me, what was highly valued by most participants was the direct contact with members of the museum’s Learning Services team. I observed that participants welcomed the opportunity to talk with real museum workers. Their experience of museum practitioners, to date, had been largely confined to the welcome desk of respective institutions or through special events or tours where they were talked at. The opportunity to communicate directly with the museum allowed some participants to share their thoughts and feelings about the services that museums provide. I suggest that curators open themselves up to such exchanges on a more frequent basis—it may result in reciprocal benefits for all stakeholders. Fortifying IdentityA third way museums can contribute to social or community development is by:fortify[ing] the bonds between the members of the community and reaffirm their identities making them feel more secure about who they are; and give them a chance to tell their own version of their history to “outsiders” which empowers them. (Lamas 52)Identity informs us and others of who we are and where we belong in the world (Silverman 54). However, the process of identity marking and making can be fraught: “some communities are ours by choice … [and] … some are ours because of the ways that others see us” (Watson 4). Communities are formed by identifying who is in and who is out (Francois Dubet qtd. in Bessant and Watts 260). In other words, the construction of collective identity is reinforced through means of social inclusion and social exclusion. The participants of my study, as members or clients of the Royal Society for the Blind | Canberra Blind Society, clearly value participating in events with empathetic peers. People with vision impairment are not a homogenous group, however. Reinforcing the cultural influences on the formation of identity, Fiona Candlin asserts that “to state the obvious but often ignored fact, blind people … [come] … from all social classes, all cultural, racial, religious and educational backgrounds” (101). Irrespective of whether blindness or low vision arises congenitally, adventitiously, or through unexpected illness, injury, or trauma, the end result is an assortment of individuals with differing perceptual characteristics who construct meaning in often divergent ways (De Coster and Loots 326–34). They also hold differing world views. Therefore, “participation [at the museum] is not an end in itself. It is a means for creating a better world” (Assunção dos Santos 9). According to the Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Professor Gillian Triggs, a better world is: a society for all, in which every individual has an active role to play. Such a society is based on fundamental values of equity, equality, social justice, and human rights and freedoms, as well as on the principles of tolerance and embracing diversity. (Triggs)Publicly funded museums can play a fundamental role in the cultural lives of societies. For example, the Powerhouse Museum (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences) in Sydney partnered with Vision Australia to host an exhibition in 2010 titled Living in a Sensory World: it offered “visitors an understanding of the world of the blindness and low vision community and celebrates their achievements” (Powerhouse Museum). With similar intent, my doctoral research seeks to validate the world of my participants by inviting museums to appreciate their aspirations as a distinct but diverse community of people. ConclusionIn conclusion, the challenge for museum curators and other museum practitioners is balancing what Richard Sennett (qtd. in Bessant and Watts 265) identifies as opportunities for enhancing social cohesion and a sense of belonging while mitigating parochialism and community divisiveness. Therefore, curators, as the primary focus of this article, are indeed challenged when asked to contribute to serving the public through social development—a public which is anything but homogenous. Mindful of cultural and social differences in an ever-changing world, museums are called to respect the cultural and natural heritage of the communities they serve and collaborate with (ICOM 10). It is a position I wholeheartedly support. This is not to say that museums or indeed curators are capable of solving the ills of society. However, inviting people who are frequently excluded from social and cultural events to multisensory encounters with museum collections acknowledges their cultural rights. I suggest that this would be a seismic shift from the current experiences of adults with blindness or low vision at most museums.ReferencesAlexander, Edward, and Mary Alexander.

Through participation in educational systems, there is important learning about the self and others, both for individual development and social solidarity. Individual development and social solidarity are interrelated. These are important values in education at all levels. Individuals are social beings and are necessarily interdependent on others. Nevertheless, individualism and social solidarity are values that sometimes can diverge and come into conflict. These values can be defined and interpreted in various ways. In a time of neo-liberalism, for example, where individual choices and rights are put at the forefront of the societal and educational discourses in many countries it is relevant to raise questions on how issues of solidarity and individualism are interpreted and negotiated in education. What kind of shape and definitions do these concepts take when schools and preschools live under the intense pressures for the accountability of educational outcomes(Biesta, 2009)? Under what conditions can values, such as solidarity and individualism, co-exist and develop in multicultural and globalized societies, without one dominating the other...",

      "abstract": "The complete vocational and social re-integration of the psychiatrically disabled (schizophrenic type) is only possible to a certain degree, even after a temporary stay of approximately one year at a transitional home for the psychiatrically disabled where comprehensive therapeutic measures are provided. This is shown by the experiences gained during a three-year period of work with a study sample of 190 persons at the socio-psychiatric rehabilitation centre \"Bodelschwinghaus\" in Neuss, Federal Republic of Germany. A partial rehabilitation i.e., the ability to live in a community home and work in a workshop for the disabled was more successful. As a rule, the psychiatrically disabled need a long time in an encouraging and sheltered living situation which, nevertheless, must be open to the social environment, to obtain, in some cases, the degree of stabilisation necessary to one day lead an independent life. Accelerated measures structured according to economical and financial principles do not meet the needs of the psychiatrically disabled. This is why a rigorous separation between transitional and permanent homes is not appropriate in psychiatric rehabilitation.",

Pollution, depletion of natural resources, and intergroup conflict can be characterized as examples of urgent social dilemmas. This chapter advances a conceptual framework in which we analyze social dilemmas in terms of social and temporal concerns relevant to the social (individual vs. collective) and temporal (short-term vs. long-term) conflicts underlying social dilemmas. We discuss the plasticity of social orientations (altruism, cooperation, egalitarianism, individualism, competition, aggression) and temporal orientations (short-term orientation, future orientation) within the context of Messick and colleagues' recent appropriateness framework (Weber, Kopelman, & Messick, 2004).",

      "title": "Le mod e il loro uso tra storia, usi pubblici e politici, trasgressione",
      "abstract": "Nel variegato mondo del modding digitale, è possibile imbattersi in modifiche che possono riguardare tematiche tra le più svariate e bizzarre.Partendo da semplici memes, passando per omaggi alla cultura POP a battute e giochi di parole, si può arrivare anche a casi molto più estremi, alle volte persino offensivi.La grande, se non spesso totale, libertà di intervento e personalizzazione lasciata al grande pubblico ha come altra faccia della medaglia il fatto che i singoli utenti, all'interno delle loro modifiche, possono manifestare i loro pensieri e opinioni politiche.Nelle community, invero, le mod sono ormai usate anche come strumento di satira storico-politica.Tuttavia, anche queste forme di satira possono degenerare in estremismi di vario genere, inclusi il razzismo e/o il nazionalismo più esasperato; l'ambientazione storica in questi casi viene manipolata dai modder (cioè coloro che creano le mod) con l'intento di offendere e provocare la community.Capita spesso che questi lavori, compresi quelli più problematici e discutibili, vengano pubblicati senza nessun previo controllo nelle piattaforme ufficiali e, in assenza di tale controllo, riescono a rimanere su queste piattaforme per lunghi periodi di tempo In questo articolo verranno presi in esame alcuni esempi e come un editore (Paradox) gestisce queste situazioni in cui spesso si sconfina in un abuso pubblico (e politico) della storia.Questo articolo è stato sottoposto a revisione in doppio cieco (double blind peer review) IntroduzioneIn ambito videoludico, una mod (abbreviazione di \"modification\" in inglese) è un'alterazione apportata a un gioco, che coinvolge elementi quali grafica, interfaccia di gioco (gameplay), trama e altri aspetti [1].Le mod possono essere ideate sia da sviluppatori professionisti che da appassionati, e servono per amplificare l'esperienza di gioco, introdurre nuove funzionalità o personalizzare il gioco stesso secondo le preferenze e le esigenze del giocatore.La prima (o comunque una delle prime) mod videoludica può essere considerata la Castle of Smurf Stein realizzata nel 1983 per il gioco Castle of Wolfenstein.[2] Nel videogioco originale il protagonista si scontra con le forze naziste.Nella mod, che si presenta come una parodia, esse sono sostituite dai puffi (smurfs in inglese).In questo primo caso i due autori, Andrew Johnson e Preston Nevins (all'epoca ancora minorenni), modificarono il codice di gioco da autodidatti, ma a partire da questo momento l'arte del modding[3] ha subito un'evoluzione, trasformandosi da semplice veicolo per l'espressione goliardica dei giocatori a qualcosa di più ampio e diversificato.Oggi il modding non è più un'attività realizzata all'insaputa degli sviluppatori e dei produttori originali dei videogiochi.Al contrario, molte software house scelgono di proposito di rendere accessibile il codice sorgente e di fornire agli utenti strumenti appositi per la personalizzazione del gioco in modo da avere gratis più contenuti per il proprio gioco e creare uno spirito di condivisione e partecipazione attiva tra i giocatori che li porta a fidelizzarsi al prodotto.Questa libertà consente alla comunità (community) [4] di giocatori e appassionati di apportare modifiche al gioco originale senza richiedere necessariamente competenze informatiche avanzate.In questo contesto, le modifiche possono essere di natura semplice, come cambiare l'estetica di alcune elementi del videogioco o addirittura creare nuovi elementi e nuovi contenuti.Non solo: una volta creata una mod, sono le case di produzione a occuparsi della sua pubblicazione e distribuzione presso gli altri giocatori.Oltretutto il processo di installazione di queste modifiche del gioco è diventato oggi molto più semplice e addirittura favorito in fase di acquisto del gioco sulle maggiori piattaforme di vendita online, dove le mod possono essere aggiunte con pochi click, in maniera rapida e gratuita.L'aspetto giocoso e scherzoso continua a permeare ancora oggi le comunità dei modders.[5]Questo porta, per ogni gioco \"moddabile\", a vedere proliferare mod dalla qualità discutibile, frutto del lavoro di giocatori senza pretese.Alcune però si distinguono per la loro creatività e per le innovazioni che apportano tanto a livello tecnico quanto di giocabilità. Le mod grafiche e multiplayerPrendiamo ad esempio le varie mod grafiche sviluppate per giochi come GTA [6] e Half-Life [7].Queste mod permettono a titoli che potrebbero apparire datati di assumere un aspetto grafico simile a quello dei videogiochi più recenti.Lo stesso risultato si può ottenere con le mod multigiocatori, in cui le immagini di gioco vengono sostituire con immagini ad alta risoluzione, vengono abbelliti i menu di scelta e si ottimizzano i comandi di gioco.A titolo di esempio, si possono contemplare video che mettono a confronto GTA5 nella sua versione originale e quella \"moddata\", proprio nel tentativo di avvicinare il gioco al fotorealismo.

The symbolism is highly interesting, although it has been discussed multiple times already. The use of available resources and the more or less noticeable artistry (or, on the contrary, triviality, kitsch) also draw attention. We can see people, draped monuments, posters and banners, effigies and representations of a non-figurative nature. It is all about raising interest, specifying identity, building alliances and a supporting auditorium. The aesthetics is to boost or disrupt, use its sociotechnical value. Writings on the walls have political content and various fonts, they appear in unexpected places. There are also differences in the visual reception of various audiences – participants of the events, municipal service forces, media representatives, engaged Internet users (engaged because they use the broadcast for agitation), even artists view the circumstances differently.",

After a while, complaints disappear as people develop workarounds or ways of overcoming, without solving, the problems, or avoid them, or disengage from the process, or displace the costs to others. But the tension and frustration percolates throughout the organization and its environment, and different people who have to interact with the system (employees, customers, technical support, administrators) continue to pay in varying psychological, professional, pedagogical, or just practical ways. Such interactions would seem nonsensical on the face of it: why would organization members regularly behave in ways that frustrate them, weaken their performance, or create other kinds of negative outcomes? And why should it prove so difficult for well-intentioned people to change such patterns?

      "abstract": "The current state of research of the phenomenon of social expectations is analyzed, which made it possible to highlight the essence and features of social expectations of adolescents and young people. It is established that the existence of different approaches to understanding the concept of «social expectations of young people» is a reflection of the evolution of the phenomenon itself. The concept of «social expectations» does not have a clear theoretical and methodological definition, which complicates the implementation of the procedure of monitoring and evaluation of its results, in particular in martial law and postwar. It was found that the determinants of their implementation may be the characteristics of the young person (age, gender, region and place of residence). It is shown that the focus on the future reflects promising areas of realization of social expectations. Taking into account the threats and challenges of martial law and post-war future orientation of young people leads to changes in values (education, work and career, cooperation, service), social (equality, social justice, national identity, patriotism, helping others), life (sustainability, strategic, self-efficacy, locus of control) and family (marriage, family and parenthood) perspectives. The purpose of the study: to analyze modern theoretical approaches to understanding the phenomenon of «social expectations of young people» and identify promising areas of social expectations related to the measurement of threats and challenges of the war and postwar period. The results of the study provide a theoretical expansion of the construct of «social expectations» by finding indicators of specific characteristics and factors of their formation, taking into account age, gender, environmental and regional aspects.",

The norm of reciprocity is a central aspect of social exchange: Simply put, individuals tend to feel a sense of responsibility after someone provides a gift or another act of kindness (Gouldner, 1960). Yet, it would be a mistake to focus solely on what happens after receiving a kindness: it is also common for individuals to struggle with asking for help or to be reluctant to accept it even when offered, either in anticipation of the negative feelings associated with debts of gratitude and/or because it would conflict with their striving for self-sufficiency. As the quote from singer-songwriter Amanda Palmer's (2014) bestselling book illustrates, the social dynamics of asking for, giving, and receiving help are fraught. Participation in these exchange activities is a skilled social accomplishment (see Chapter 2 for classic anthropological observations of gift exchange). There is a reason it is called the art of asking.",

      "abstract": "&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Humans have their own potential as an instrument to &lt;br /&gt;perfect their existence. In the process of perfecting, they always do &lt;br /&gt;some processes as well as social interactions to optimize any &lt;br /&gt;potential they had by synchronizing internal and external poten-&lt;br /&gt;tials of their social environment. A phenomenon shows that there &lt;br /&gt;are two possibilities resulted by the process: harmony or clash. &lt;br /&gt;The process of harmony is indicated by accomplishment of any &lt;br /&gt;objectives or needs of each individual that does the social &lt;br /&gt;interaction. On the contrary, the clash process will happen if the &lt;br /&gt;interactions turn to violence on weak/poor individual or group, &lt;br /&gt;either structurally or culturally, socially, and economically. One of &lt;br /&gt;causes of the clash resulting violence is the absence of social &lt;br /&gt;control, imbalance of hierarchical interaction, social imbalance &lt;br /&gt;and poor economy. Multicultural education can be set as an &lt;br /&gt;approach in learning/education in Indonesia by firstly examining &lt;br /&gt;its philosophical background and educational theory which, then, &lt;br /&gt;leads to the method(s) and technique(s) of learning/education to &lt;br /&gt;shape generation that have the following characteristics: tolerated, &lt;br /&gt;social-characterized, and aware to certainty of diversity as &lt;br /&gt;sunatullah that hopefully results in decreasing clash phenomena &lt;br /&gt;which lead to any violence or conflict.",

      "title": "Having more friends is associated with greater sensitization to social exclusion: Neural and behavioral evidence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Social rejection profoundly affects well-being. How do features of people’s real-world social networks relate to responses to social exclusion? People central in social networks—e.g., who have many friends—may be less distressed by exclusion, since they have many sources of support, or more sensitive to it, if they are more attuned to social feedback. We characterized a village’s social network; a subset of residents (N = 74) completed an fMRI study involving social exclusion in groups characterized by varying social relationships (spouses, friends, strangers). Highly-central individuals reported greater distress during exclusion by strangers, and their distress ratings scaled with responses in brain regions associated with social pain, negative affect, and mentalizing. Thus, while social connectedness is often considered a protective factor that promotes well-being, these findings suggest a potential ironic effect of social connectedness–vulnerability to distress in particular social contexts. This sensitization to exclusion could constitute an adaptive tendency to promote long-term wellness.",

Though there is a fundamental necessity for coercion, or its threat, for eliciting civil social behavior in a well-functioning society, it is professionally and ethically imperative that social workers make explicit our rationales for, justifications of, and the evidence used to support or reject coercive practices in our work. Social work’s engagement with coercion inevitably entails the ethical and social policy arguments for and against its use, as shown in a review of the empirical evidence regarding its impact on the professions’ clients, exemplified by three domains: (1) child welfare, (2) mental health, and (3) addictions. Recommendations for future improvements involve balancing the potential for harm against the benefits of coercive actions.",

      "abstract": "What kinds of relationships do design researchers engage with when their work is based on a compassion to care for, empathise with and empower the poor, the subaltern, the powerless, the ‘other’? What kind of epistemologies and politics are produced through such relationships? How do we, as design researchers, with different privileges account for our positions in these complex relationships? What mechanisms are at work that frame certain political concerns as matters of these types of design, rendering certain sites as potential space for design interventions and certain bodies as possible subject of these design works? As a seemingly innocent term and well-intentioned endeavour, compassion tends to foreground a moral position to design practices such as humanitarian and social design. It mobilizes a sense of care through a binary relationship. For instance, by being empathic to someone, the empathizer enters into a relationship with the empathized which the later has little or no control over it. As designers’ engagement with social and political issues in general and with vulnerable groups and individuals in particular proliferate in academic, commercial and governmental contexts, it is necessary to ask what other practices beyond the actual or anticipated design solutions, services or systems are produced in these situations? What if there is a fine line between care and control?",

      "abstract": "Using the lens of social capital-especially bridging or cross-cutting ties that cut across social groups and between social groups and government-provides new insights into policy design. Solidarity within social groups creates ties (bonding social capital) that bring people and resources together. In unequal societies, ties that cut across groups (bridging social capital) are essential for social cohesion and for poverty reduction. The nature of interaction between state and society is characterized as complementarity and substitution. When states are functional, the informal and formal work well together-for example, government support or community-based development. When states become dysfunctional, the informal institutions become a substitute and are reduced to serving a defensive or survival function. To move toward economic and social well-being, states must support inclusive development. Investments in the organizational capacity of the poor are critical. Interventions are also required to foster bridging ties across social groups-ethnic, religious, caste, or racial groups. Such interventions can stem from the state, private sector, or civil society and include: Changes in rules to include groups previously excluded from formal systems of finance, education, and governance, at all levels. Political pluralism and citizenship rights. Fairness before the law for all social groups together. Infrastructure that eases communication. Education, media, and public information policies that reinforce norms and values of tolerance and diversity.",

      "abstract": "Complex social problems have multilevel roots and intricate webs of causation.They arise at the intersection of several of the spheres that comprise modern life: the physical, biological, cultural, political, social, economic, technological and environmental.They challenge the limited cognitive capacities of human beings, as delays, nonlinearities, policy resistance and complex interactions between the different parts of a system produce unforeseen consequences and patterns of systemic behaviors that are difficult to anticipate.Incentivized by the short-term focus of the political system, policy makers tend to act on the most visible parts of problems, which are often not causes but symptoms.They produce policies that often lead to worse conditions over time.Learning in complex systems, on the other hand, is hindered, because feedback from policies is typically opaque and amenable to distortion.This study draws on the complexity sciences, system dynamics, social marketing and related fields to address the issue of human development.We first explore the characteristics of complex social problems, showing that disciplines such as social marketing, based on individualistic mindware, are ill equipped to address them.The dissertation defends the need for a new interdisciplinary field (complex social problems management) capable of dealing with the challenging social problems of our times.In particular, we focus on the replication of low human development across generations, discussing the concepts of poverty, well-being and human development as well as the conditions that foster the development of essential psychobiological mechanisms in the first years of life.The discussion encompasses the social ecosystems that constrain opportunities for the poor and reinforce detrimental structures that produce toxic stress and low attention to human capital.A broad causal loop diagram summarizes the feedback loops that explain the persistence of this phenomenon.Based on the discussion in the first three chapters, we present three system dynamics models in the subsequent chapters, each one addressing an aspect of the problem.The first model, which we call the Caped model, focuses on parents' and children's essential capabilities and on the social environmental demands that deplete parents' psychological resources.The second model broadens the scope of the first and focuses on explaining why societies (in particular, Brazil) that are dominated by rent-seeking and extractive institutions produce detrimental social ecosystems.We uncover what seems to be a central mechanism, which is narrative (mindware) control.The third model deals with social change in general, and it aims to describe the channels and conditions by which that change occurs.It complements the analysis in the preceding chapters by identifying how a deep societal change toward the promotion of human development can occur.This dissertation contributes to the study of human development by employing a method that is suitable for modeling complex social problems.By identifying critical feedback loops and essential processes at the micro and macro levels, it provides integrative frameworks that complement research already conducted on the subject.From a practical perspective, the models can orient the design of better public policies and the design of adequate mindware for the discussion of human development.",

The rapidly changing dynamics of life will cause the new problem in the order of social life it is balanced character education in the society. The lack of control by the state as law enforcement and community justice can eventually erode the public trust in state administrators. The new social problems are the loss of the value of social life in a transitional society that need to be taken seriously through the state- characterized education as follows: (1) the waning of value in social life and citizenship (2) the degradation of value of tolerance in society (3) the waning of values of honesty, and a sense of mutual help (4) the weakening of values in the family (5) the practice of corruption, collusion and nepotism in the governance (6) the damage in the system and economic life (7) the violation of the nationality values. During this time, informal education, especially in the family environment has not significantly contributed in supporting the achievement of competence and character formation of the students. The relatively high bustle and working activity of parents, the lack of understanding of the parents in educating children in the family environment, the influence of the association in the neighbourhood, and the influence of the electronic media are considered to be able to give negative effect to progress and achievement of the students' learning outcomes. One of the alternatives to overcome these problems is through the integrated character education, namely to integrated and optimize the activities of informal education in the family environment with formal education at school. An important agenda that needs attention to overcome this problem is how to build the characteristics of nation based on the local potential and excellence through education. The second is the last bastion of civilization guard when all educational institutions are not able to function optimally.",

The elaboration of folklore as a communicative process which is culturally rulegoverned has gone hand in hand with work in other disciplines concerned with communication in specific groups: socio-linguistics, rhetorical theory, communication theory and the ethnography of speaking (Hymes, 1972; Bauman and Sherzer, 1974; Burke, 1957). These scholars and other performance-oriented folklorists (BenAmos and Goldstein 1974) as well as Erving Goffman (1974) focus on the dynamics of small group interaction and emphasize the significance of individual strategy for stylized communication and the achievement of one's goal. Such factors as individual choice, persuasion, negotiation, and manipulation of linguistic and cultural rules and norms in the accomplishment of social action are said to be important because verbal behaviour is purposeful.

Notably, students can solve more problems with others than they can alone, especially when they disagree effectively (sociocognitive conflict theory) and learn from these collaborations (social constructivism theory). However, collaborators concerned with their relative status (social comparison theory and status theory) can distort their evaluations toward higher status people’s ideas, as indicated by politeness discourse markers (politeness theory). Using new mixed methods (statistical interpretive discourse analysis), studies have modeled micro-level collaborative creativity processes. Their results have yielded specific teacher recommendations (e.g., role-model the processes, work in pairs before working in groups, monitor, and intervene when necessary) to increase their students’ creativity to solve global problems.",

It is emphasized that such approaches have a framework nature and are designed to promote development and encourage the population to engage in socially useful activities, which will help reduce social tension caused by the state’s inability to respond to society’s demands or other contemporary challenges. It is emphasized that intergovernmental organizations, state institutions, business corporations and even representatives of the third sector can directly or indirectly use free social resources to achieve their economic interests, thereby transforming volunteering into a technology of social management and a hybrid social phenomenon. It contributes to the building of symbolic capital and public trust, as important social assets that open wide prospects for self-presentation of both individuals and entire organizations. It was revealed that hybridity is manifested not only in the organizational and institutional conditions of volunteering, but also in the variety of motivations manifested in the participants of non-governmental volunteering projects.",

Para ello se ha recurrido a diferentes perspectivas (macroscopica, microscopica y reflexiva) y tecnicas de analisis (analisis de corpus de texto, analisis territorial, analisis del discurso de los actores, analisis del paisaje y observacion participante) que son complementarias entre si. Las multiples alianzas y conflictos por la (entendida como el reparto de los beneficios y de las cargas inherentes al desarrollo) que se detectan en las diferentes escalas tienen mucho que ver con la creciente incompatibilidad objetiva entre ciertos usos pero tambien con la diferente valoracion subjetiva que tienen los diferentes actores sobre el espacio y los recursos, lo que se refleja en diferentes practicas cotidianas, en la mayor o menor implicacion en planes, programas y actuaciones, en la movilizacion social a favor o en contra de determinados proyectos, etc. El conflicto no es puramente economico, sino tambien politico y cultural. La ecodistribucion es conflictiva en la medida que las posibilidades de acceso a los recursos y de participacion en los planes no son identicas para todos; en la medida que los diferentes actores sociales, economicos e institucionales otorgan diferente valor (economico, ecologico y/o paisajistico) al espacio y a los recursos; y en la medida que estan en juego la soberania sobre el territorio y la preservacion de bienes publicos. En los ultimos anos los conflictos se agudizan por las carencias de informacion sobre la situacion ambiental, por los escasos canales de participacion social, por la ausencia de politicas integradas y territorializadas y por la disociacion entre los planes de desarrollo y los planes de conservacion.",

      "abstract": "Öffentlichkeit und Medien sind die entscheidenden Instanzen für die allgemeine Anerkennung von Problemen. Sie sind auch und vor allem eine zentrale Bezugsgröße für das politische Handeln sozialer Bewegungen. Die Aufmerksamkeit der Öffentlichkeit ist die Prämisse, daß die Anliegen und ihre Protagonisten ins gesellschaftliche Bewußtsein gelangen und von der Politik und einem großen Teil der Bevölkerung wahrgenommen werden. Die Abhängigkeit von öffentlicher Resonanz — als notwendige, wenngleich auch nicht hinreichende Leistung für die Zielerreichung einer Bewegung — ergibt sich daraus, daß Bewegungen im Gegensatz zu Interessengruppen oder politischen Parteien nicht über institutionalisierte Zugänge zu den politisch oder ökonomisch verantwortlichen Instanzen verfügen (Rucht 1991, S. 15; allg. Lowie 1971). Hinzu kommen die Ressourcenarmut der Bewegungen und ihr Mangel an eigener Sanktionsmacht, welche den Erfolg des Protests an die öffentliche Verbreitung der Anliegen knüpfen. Zwar bedürfen auch andere politische Organisationen wie Parteien oder Verbände in mehr oder weniger großem Ausmaß der Öffentlichkeit und der Massenmedien, für Bewegungen ist sie jedoch der primäre (mittelbare oder unmittelbare) Adressat: (Battelle-Institut 1975, S. 78; ähnlich Zwick 1990, S. 111).",

      "abstract": "Interorganizational cooperation depends on many factors including the similarity and differences between the partners in terms of e.g. organizational culture, knowledge, resources, or in relation to geographical location to each other. These differences can be analyzed by using the concept of distance which occurs in various dimensions. The aim of the paper is to identify distance dimensions and to indicate how they affect business cooperation in a tourist destination. To achieve this aim, the research on economic cooperation was used, involving semi-structured interviewees with tourist entrepreneurs operating in different Polish municipalities. Research showed that all types of distance dimensions (cognitive, communicative, organizational, functional, social, cultural and geographical) are important for tourism cooperation, although in relation to the processes related to a given territory (e.g. tourism development) the role of some of them, such as social distance or geographical, is crucial",

      "abstract": "Abstrak\r\n\r\nDalam berhubungan dengan anggota masyarakat, manusia menggunakan berbagai macam variasi bahasa supaya menarik dan maksud yang disampaikan dapat diterima dengan baik. Variasi bahasa ini dapat terjadi karena faktor lokasi (tempat berinteraksinya suatu masyarakat) dan faktor sosial (kedudukan sosial seseorang dalam masyarakat). Variasi bahasa juga dapat dipengaruhi oleh etnik (kebudayaan) dan religi (kepercayaan) suatu masyarakat. Dalam hal ini ada dua sumber utama yang menyebabkan kompleksnya penyebaran dialek. Sumber pertama adalah mobilitas geografis, individu-individu berpindah dari satu tempat ke tempat yang lain dengan membawa dialek mereka, sekalipun mereka mengubahnya untuk menyesuaikan diri dengan lingkungan mereka yang baru. Sumber kompleksitas kedua adalah fakta bahwa geografi hanya merupakan salah satu faktor relevan, dan faktor-faktor lain adalah kelas sosial, jenis kelamin, dan usia. Oleh karena itu, para dialektolog berbicara tentang dialek sosial atau sosiolek untuk mengacu pada perbedaan-perbedaan non-regional. Karena faktor-faktor ini, maka seorang penutur bahasa mungkin memperlihatkan lebih banyak kesamaan dalam bahasanya kepada mereka yang berasal dari kelompok sosial yang sama di daerah yang berbeda kepada mereka yang berasal dari kelompok sosial yang berbeda di daerah yang sama. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui tentang variasi bahasa berdasarkan status sosialnya yang terjadi di masyarakat Kecamatan Palabuahan Ratu Kabupaten Sukabumi.

      "abstract": "En las sociedades latinoamericanas es evidente como las desigualdades economicas se traducen tambien en desigualdades culturales; la concentracion de la riqueza se traduce en una concentracion de la palabra. La estructura de desigualdades materiales incorpora una nueva dimension: la  distribucion inequitativa de los recursos que poseen los grupos desaventajados en las llamadas  “sociedad de informacion”. Esta nueva desigualdad incluye disparidades en el acceso a la informacion y la comunicacion publica a traves de los cuales la ciudadania puede autogobernarse. Ahora bien, cuando la comunicacion se organiza a traves del  mercado, en funcion de la capacidad economica de los actores involucrados, entonces los sectores con menos recursos tendran menos oportunidades para expresarse libremente, para senalar sus problemas, para manifestar sus demandas, para controlar los actos de sus representantes, pero tambien para definirse como actor.  En este contexto de deficit informacional o bloqueo mediatico, los grupos sociales desaventajados, a traves del activismo social (Protesta social o apertura de foros publicos), desarrollaron diferentes estrategias tendientes a construir su propia informacion y sus propios canales de comunicacion.  Estrategias tendientes a mantener abierto espacios publicos donde las distintas voces puedan ser escuchadas.  Pero tambien el Estado, a traves del activismo estatal, es decir, apelando al poder de policia (reglamentario) o al poder distributivo (subsidios) puede preservar la integridad  del debate publico, creando las condiciones para la construccion de un debate plural, deshinibido y vigoroso, garantizando a  aquellos sectores desaventajados puedan participar del debate colectivo y manifestar su desacuerdo.",

      "title": "Professionalization",
      "abstract": "Any account of the professions, and of the role played by professions in the larger society, must meet two criteria: it must include the salient characteristics of professions, even the characteristics apparently in conflict; and it must make logical and moral sense of the substantial rights and responsibilities assigned to them. The two features most publicly associated with professionalism, by any profession's own declaration at least, are maximal competence in a certain area of knowledge or skill, and a moral commitment to the public good in that area; these features may be treated as the individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions to justify \"professionalization,\" i.e., the social award of a legitimate monopoly of practice in that area to the organized profession. A third prominent feature of some professions is the commitment on the part of individual professionals to the welfare and interests of individuals in their charge—clients, patients, students, or parishioners—even when (as in certain cases of maintenance of \"confidentiality\") protection of such interests is contrary to the public good and thus apparently derogates from the \"public service\" commitment above. This feature too can be integrated into the larger picture of the common good as productive of social welfare in the long run. By reassuring the public that confidences will be respected, such a provision increases public trust in the profession and encourages the public to resort to professionals in time of need. There is also a fourth characteristic of most professions: the professionals seem to be able to command very large fees. This feature can be justified as a benefit of legal monopoly.For example, remuneration is one more inducement to the profession to adhere to the set of rules identified as its \"professional ethic,\" general adherence to which will benefit the society as a whole: if the ethic is substantially violated the monopoly will be withdrawn and the benefit will be lost. 2 The first criterion is well met by this account; the second is satisfied in the assumption that the specific moral commitment of any profession fits an area of social concern or need: there must be a match between the service that the profession is qualified to provide and an area of public need that would be very difficult to provide for through ordinary public facilities. Such a close fit between professionally offered service and demand—conjoined with the requirements that provision of the service entail lengthy training in esoteric skill and knowledge, that the providers offering the service can validate claims to competence in it, and that they have publicly committed themselves to use their skills only for the public good—justifies entrusting that area of social need to the providers of that service.",

We study the role of symbols in an infinitely repeated public goods game with random matching, endogenous partnership termination, limited information flows and endogenous symbol choice. We characterize an efficiently segregating equilbrium, in which players only cooperate with others bearing the same symbol. Players bearing a scarcer symbol face a longer expected search time to find a cooperative partner upon partnership termination, and can therefore sustain higher levels of cooperation. We compare this equilibrium to other equilibria in terms of Pareto dominance and robustness to (some form of) bilateral renegotiation.",

In one way, this state of affairs might be interpreted as a kind of customisation, an acknowledgement of different aspects of care or different perspectives which care demands, though the solution was clearly inelegant. Though the prevailing organisation of social services (by social unit, family care, for example) represents more efficient resource allocation, it fails to do justice to the manifold nature of most social problems, because current reporting structures, and patterns of task differentiation, have produced what may be called a social work archipelago, composed of units with closed information habits which reduce the impact of decisions and judgements on the system as a whole. In this short paper, I offer a basic model for information in social service, which is based on previous studies and informal observations by practitioners.",

Ontogeny of behaviour does not develop in a \"domestic dog typical\" way, rather it is characterized by significant differences among dog breeds concerning the rate of development of certain behavioural characters and physiological processes (both relative retardation and relative acceleration compared to the ontogeny of behaviour in wolves). 2.

Second, research issues become increasingly globalized: People are migrating into other cultures and bring along their cultural backgrounds and understandings—of social services, for example. If we want to study encounters of migrating people with the local social systems, we face a diversity of experiences and values. Third, for understanding such an encounter from both sides, we may need to adapt our methods or even need a triangulation of methods (e.g., biographic interviews, expert interviews, and ethnographies).

      "title": "We Think—Therefore, We Are",
      "abstract": "Abstract Humans think not only as individuals but also as members of a society. Their actions are influenced as much by their individual thinking as by their circumstances, social networks, and norms. Their collective behaviours for the better (such as creating widespread trust) or worse (such as the existence of widespread corruption) develop and evolve as a function of interaction between individual and social thinking. To survive in society, people need to coordinate their actions to generate social changes for the improved welfare of society, particularly when people are unable to communicate with each other directly. Insightful applications of ‘Schelling’s focal point’ serve as a possible useful social coordinating mechanism to bring society to a state of equilibrium where nobody can profit by deviating unilaterally (Nash equilibrium). Multiple equilibria are possible, some good, some not. Societies would obviously wish to reach a good equilibrium but often face challenges of collective actions (tragedy of the commons, climate change) where social dilemmas arise. The well-known game of Prisoner’s Dilemma illustrates this: what appears to be in the best interest of an individual is not necessarily so for society as a whole and ultimately neither for the individual. However, thankfully, humans are not always ‘rational’. While not angels, they are not always selfish either. They are often altruistic, cooperate, and trust each other. Thus, policies and institutional practices assuming that people are fully rational can be misplaced if cognitive, psychological, and social influences on human behaviour are ignored.",

      "abstract": "nnnnn qThere seems to be a consensus ... that we will not approach success in the solution of our urban crises without the expansion and further development of new forms of participation. We are sensitively aware of the effects of inadequate participation and deficiencies in our representative systems ... the forces of tension in society demand that such attempts (i.e. experimentation) be made - irrespective of the fact that we are yet unsure whether the result is a permanent contribution to community stability or instabilityq.nnnnn Mann, 1970, p. 182.nnnnn The research reported in this thesis is set in the context of concern expressed by Mann. It is organized into four inter related parts.nnnnn Many of the problems which beset exercises of citizen participation in planning are derived from confusion about the philosophical and theoretical bases, and from the popular misconception that, rather than being the manifestation of an attitude of mind committed to involvement in civic affairs, participation is merely a technique for making decisions.nnnnn Planning may be interpreted as an integral part of the broad spectrum of political affairs, particularly at the level of local government. As a consequence of this, citizen participation, as a contribution to community decision-making, may be considered to be a means of achieving a redistribution of power in the community, and the role of the planner may be considered as political rather than apolitical. These matters are evident in the participation experiences of the United States and Australia.nnnnn Inadequate performances with, and from citizen participation in planning are the by-products of an imperfect knowledge of the intricacies of community decision-making; this unsatisfactory state may be overcome by subjecting the participation phenomenon to a process of progressive disaggregation into its component parts, the process being structured into inter-related levels of specificity.nnnnn In this thesis are recordednnnnn * (In Chapter 1) a general review of the political context of planning, and the experiences of the United States and Australia of citizen participation in planning;nnnnn * (In Chapter 2) the components of the analytical device used throughout Part 2 - the levels of specificity;nnnnn * (In Chapter 3) a discussion of the nature and processes of planning, considered as responses to prevailing or emerging political, social, economic, professional and technical conditions;nnnnn * (In Chapter 4) an investigation of the political nature of community decision-making, a consideration of the continuum of political styles, and an interpretation of the key concepts of 'representation' and 'the public interest';nnnnn * (In Chapter 5) an examination of the broad categories of participants - the elected representatives, the public servants, the public ('en masse', in groups and as individuals), the government agencies and professional institutes, the consultants and advocacy planners n and an interpretation of their respective competencies and motivations;nnnnn * (In Chapter 6) a consideration of the means of participation, which for convenience have been categorized as 'conventional' (for example, exhibitions, public meetings, surveys, information dissemination), 'innovative' (delphi, nominal group, brainstorming, charette techniques), 'self-help' (manuals, institutionalized planning aid, task forces), and dependent upon improvements to mass electronic communication technology;nnnnn * (In Chapter 7) a brief consideration of a diversity of matters derived for the preceding examinations, such as the manipulative and control factors which contribute to the distribution of power between participants, the condition of public apathy and non-participation, the influence of the mass media, the special requirements demanded by participation practices (for example, planners with particular communication skills, extended time-scales in the planning process, additional financial resources).nnnnn The discussion of this pertinent theory is used to structure the empirical study made of planning and citizen participation in Brisbane in the period 1961 to 1975, coincident with the Lord Mayoralty of Clem Jones, and the preparation of plans with varying degrees of citizen participation for submission in accordance with the relevant statutes in 1961, 1969 and 1974/75 Chapter 8).nnnnn The principal conclusions to be drawn from the research are that the participation phenomenon is intrinsically more complex than is generally recognized, that no practice should be commenced before the diversity of conceptual, theoretical and practical considerations have been identified and understood by the intending participants, that further experimentation is necessary to provide productive means of participation, that current practices should be carefully monitored and their effectiveness subjected to analysis, and that, generally, there should be a more serious commitment to research in this area of community or civic affairs.",

Marginean, I. Precupețu, coordinators Paradigma calitații vieții, Editura Academiei Române, 2011).The level of quality of life of individuals, groups and communities depends on many factors starting with what a person and his/her family, communities are doing, and ending with public policies interventions, including social policy measures.The last type of interventions consists in monetary or in kind benefits and social services, and had to be making only of the second level. This means that such measures have to come into actions only when the first factor mentioned before (person and his/her family) can not achieve a desirable level of quality of life, and they maybe in connections with what it is doing in the field by communities, Associations and Organizations thru public–private partnerships.In fact, even at the starting stage of development on quality of life in the ’60 (USA Program “The Great Society”) this domain was connected with public policies on the social field – the war against poverty.In this contribution I want to continue my several analysis in the field, taking into consideration the actual stage of Romanian society development, and I will treat the topics mostly as objectives.",

      "title": "Potential of city networks in shaping the world’s ecumene",
      "abstract": "The contemporary global space is characterised by huge disproportions of social inequalities, drastic division between a core and peripheries, unequal access to education and general mobility, and many more. These phenomena lead to a feeling of dependence and marginalisation of specific social classes as well as ethnic, national and religious minorities. In the extreme situations that might evoke a feeling of humiliation. The scale of tensions results in unpredictable acts of aggression. The need for taking actions in order to reduce these disproportions has emerged. It is necessary to aim at achieving the balance on a world scale. This means creating the world ecumene defined by Ulf Hannerz as a ‘region of persistent culture interaction and exchange.’ To a certain extent, the state of balance is an ideal state. Reaching it fully is very challenging, or perhaps even impossible. Nevertheless, we should aim at achieving the balanced state by implementing the further steps of its pursuit. Activities related to a city network might become the mechanism which enables to create the ecumene. The efficiency of public engagement is based on: (1) an anti-ideology syndrome – focusing on basic problems of living, which are universal to all of us; (2) an overlap of two basic self-organisational activities: protest politics and social participation (based on deliberative democracy); (3) performance phenomenon – depends on generating the audience for the protest politics; (4) consistency and firmness of protests practices, which results in high efficiency. In terms of architecture, aiming at the ecumene means shaping public spaces which are crucial to multiculturalism. The theory of thirdspace of Edward W. Soja (which is contradictory to the concept of Homi K. Bhabha) might be an inspiration for creating of the ecumene. The theory holds that public spaces are superpositions for two ‘worlds’ – real and symbolic. Spaces which are formed in this way enable to reveal in a performative way the potential of unexpected meetings of remote cultures.",

      "title": "Evacuation Simulation Based on Cognitive Decision Making Model in a Socio-Technical System",
      "abstract": "In the last decade the shift of information and communication systems from a purely system level to the social level is already observable. However, the integration of social / cognitive aspects into so-called social computing is not an easy task due to conceptual differences in domains. A Socio-Technical System (STS) is a recent term intending to differentiate between a social system mediated by natural sciences or information technology. Even if the mediation of social / cognitive aspects is \"theoretically\" governed by technology, the gap between \"socio\" and \"technical\" is historical and huge. Furthermore the fact that with every passing year, the technical systems become more intelligent with respect to interaction with people and their pervasiveness, a special attention should be given to modelling both social and technical components and interaction between them. For example while modelling (and simulating) an emergency situation from a public facility, the possible availability of technology at the environment (e.g. situation-aware exit signs, interactive displays, etc.) and personal (e.g. cell phones, specialized wearables etc.) level, along with its social / cognitive influence must not be overruled. To address this challenge, we have integrated cognitive decision making model abstracted from psychological, neurological and social theories of human behaviour during evacuation situations into CA based simulation. Keeping focus on a scenario in which a small population of agents is technologically assisted, some of the most interesting finding are: (i) the inclusion of a representative and authentic social behaviour model into modelling a socio-technical system essentially produces fundamental differences in methodologies, (ii) the technologically assisted agents emerge as leaders during evacuation changing the intentions of many agents within their influence (iii) even a small population of such leaders in sufficiently large population is enough to guarantee a remarkable difference, particularly improving usage of possibly under-utilized exits.",

Confronter les valeurs affichées par l'école publique de Suisse romande aux outils ordinaires d'évaluation du comportement des élèves montre une part de convergence et une autre de divergence entre le bien défini officiellement et celui que réélaborent localement les enseignants. Une analyse des instruments créés et utilisés par les praticiens fait émerger trois attentes principales : celle d'ordre social (obéissance, respect des règles) et celle de libre arbitre (autonomie, participation) font pour l'essentiel écho aux textes prescriptifs ; celle de concordance (convivialité, gentillesse, stabilité) est plutôt basée sur une connivence directe (et donc implicite) entre un maître compatissant et un élève tenu d'assumer les échecs et les frustrations qu'il peut rencontrer. On peut se demander si cet écart est propre aux équilibres helvétiques ou si toutes les démocraties doivent de facto assumer une telle tension entre l'ordre scolaire idéalisé et la manière dont il est moralisé en réalité.",

      "title": "Semantic strategies as a means of politics: Linguistic approaches to the analysis of “semantic struggles”",
      "abstract": "Political power and its exertion by various agencies of politics (i.e. politicians, civil servants, political institutions) can be described as a kind of symbolic action (cf. Edelmann 1964, 1971). Social and political reality, its perception or constitution by participants of politics (politicians and citizens), is shaped and determined by communication and its means. That is, it is shaped by linguistic expressions provided by language of public discourse. This language opens and restricts due to rules of its linguistic signs possibilities of constituting symbolic meaning and sense within a range of socially accepted definitions of political and social reality. Linguistic sense within a discourse can only be socially effective if it is an intersubjectively accepted sense. The constitution of public sense as a part of process of linguistic communication is an important part of linguistic action. This (or semiotic) constitution of public sense can determine which social and political events and facts are accepted (and with which connotations) as a part of social reality, which are existent (in a certain sense of that term) and which are not. In other possibilities of linguistic signs correspond to form (the view) of reality admitted by society. Politicians or political agencies wanting to influence publicly accepted view of political reality will try to dominate linguistic possibilities within discourse of politics (cf. Edelman 1964; Mey 1979, 423). Thus language (especially semantics of political terminology) becomes a means of political action: so-called semantic struggles are born (cf. Dieckmann 1975). To succeed in determining social interpretation (or definition) of political reality can be seen as a result of such struggles. With regard to important role of dominating interpretations of social reality there must be a strong interest for bearers of political power to defend their interpretation against competing interpretations. / This includes interest to maintain belief that there is only o n e reality and that this reality is same as official reality defined in political discourse. This also implies, that belief has to be maintained that only words (i.e. their meanings) used by bearers of political power denote (one and only) reality. Competing definitions and interpretations of political events and facts have to be denounced as wrong: as the wrong use of words, as ideological speech, as part of a struggle (whereas one's own speech is declared to be correct use of words denoting real reality) and so on (cf. Smith 1973, 105; Lasswell 1968, 12). Semantic strategies take place in public political discourses, in newspapers, tvand radio-news, interviews with politicians, etc. The function of such media for public political discourse is not only to give information about political events, but, more than this, to offer interpretations which are not dangerous for stability of political power. The official interpretation must be on market of public opinion before competing interpretations can occur and be effective. Interpretation of reality by means of language of politics works by dominating selection of certain linguistic ex121",

This study focuses instead on relational vulnerability—the decline of everyday social ties, which remains less visible but significantly shapes how communities collaborate. The research proposes treating vulnerable relationships as a primary focus of design. It introduces a method based on micro-prototypes—small, embedded interventions aimed at making social connections more visible, easier to initiate, and possible to sustain. Fieldwork in a pilot community revealed three relational design mechanisms: perception, which helps residents notice missing or silent connections; triggering, which invites informal and non-obligatory interaction; and sustaining, which supports continuity through recurring, low-effort social cues. Rather than solving defined problems, these relational strategies help open up space for encounter, attention, and emotional engagement in daily life. The findings show that design can quietly help bring inactive forms of collaboration back to life.",

Four related difficulties are identified and illustrated drawing upon studies by Herzlich (1973), Di Giacomo (1980) and Hewstone et al. (1982). First, it is argued that the treatment of representations as coextensive with social groups is potentially circular and, second, that the broad notion of consensus across representations fails to distinguish important differences between levels (‘use/mention’, ‘theory/practice’). In addition it is claimed that not enough attention is paid to the relationship between social representations and specific contexts of use, and to the constitution of social representations in language. In response to these problems it is suggested that social representations be considered as ‘linguistic repertoires’.",

The problem is more difficult for people who hardly know one another, their public good is unclear at the outset and its timing and costs are uncertain. However, history shows that even under adverse conditions, people can cooperate. As a prelude to cooperation, people can establish (or reinforce) social ties and increase their solidarity through interaction rituals. Consequently, individuals' commitments and psychological states may synchronize, so that they can depend on like-minded people rather than on a rational grasp of their situation, which is not feasible under difficult circumstances. A necessary condition is that the network that is formed (or used) during the ritual compensates for participants' initial differences. A model shows exactly what network patterns are optimal, and it predicts that at a critical level of solidarity, a heterogeneous majority homogenizes in a sudden phase transition. This synchronization yields a boost of emotional energy for a burst of collective action.",

Maybe we have to accept that social reality is not to reconstruct in social theory. But we certainly need social theorists and social theories to support citizens, policy makers and social workers in improving social reality. Social reality in post modern societies is to be characterized by problematic relationships among citizens and between citizens and the public sector and by a sharp rise in problematic behaviour. The affluent society has failed to create a more sensitive world where people behave more socially. The dominant social problem is no longer seen from a social economic perspective but from a social cultural one. Social competences and social capital are considerer to be essential assets to cope with life in post modern society. For people weak ties and thin trust are essential to integrate into society. Thick trust and strong ties can bind people to much and cause inflexibility. The current social problem is a matter of designing a social world where relationships and behaviour are fair and reasonable. \nIt asks for an interesting and creative social policy and social work, not too much stressing the problematic issues but encouraging people to trust each other. \nCurrent social policy is too much focused on the needs and problems. It has to change into a more expressive social policy, a policy that people challenges to express them and to create new relationships. Social behaviour asks for flexibility and creativity, for being authentic and playing roles.

      "title": "USING CULTURE AS A PARADIGM FOR ERADICATING CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA, YORUBA CULTURE IN THE CONTEXT",
      "abstract": "Culture serves as a social tool for maintaining historical knowledge and maintaining order in all premodern societies. One way to look at it is as teaching one the fundamentals of what constitutes right and wrong behaviour, moral versus immoral behaviour or acceptable versus unacceptable behaviour in the society. Comparatively, development is most likely to emerge in acceptable behaviour valued and upheld. The incorrect, immoral or unacceptable behaviour could hinder development in the society. The unacceptable behaviour contradict the culture of respect, honesty, transparency, openness, accountability, probity, belief systems and way of life valued in the same society (Baecker, 1997). Corrupt practices are by all standards unacceptable behaviours and according to International Transparency (IT, 2021), corruption takes place in many forms, including behaviors such as: Public employees requesting or accepting money or favors in return for services, politicians squandering public funds or providing public positions or contracts to their sponsors, friends, or families, and companies bribing authorities to get lucrative business agreements. Corruption exists in every facet of society, from business to government to the judicial system to the news media to the nonprofit sector to even the sports world. Professional enablers including bankers, attorneys, accountants, and real estate agents, as well as opaque financial systems and faceless companies, facilitate corruption by making it easier for corrupt individuals to engage in corrupt schemes and launder and conceal their unlawful money. Adamolekun (2015) argued that corruption has eaten deep into the fabric of the society that civilize society or country become curious about how to eradicate it. David Cameron, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, supported such idea in 2016 \"Corruption is the cancer that eats away at the foundation of so many of today's issues. It has an annual cost to the global economy of billions of pounds and is responsible for the destruction of employment and slow growth. Because of this, the world's impoverished are kept in abject poverty when governments are corrupt, they steal money from their citizens and keep them from enjoying the progress that is rightfully theirs. When corrupt people and businesses do not pay the taxes they should, it deprives public institutions like schools and hospitals of much-needed funding (Cameron, 2016). IT (2021) warns that corruption damages confidence, undermines democracy, slows economic growth, and deepens social and environmental divisions. As Paul Collier cited in Cameron (2016) explained, there are hotspots where corruption is more prevalent than others; these might be specific companies, countries, or historical periods. The extraction of natural resources and the construction industry have a special negative reputation for corruption. Therefore, this study interrogates how the efficacy of Yoruba traditional cultural values can be harnessed as paradigm for eradicating corruption in contemporary Nigeria state.",

      "abstract": "Social groups, such as adolescents, police, and ethnic groups, very often have their own distinctive cultures that include such ingredients as specialized foods and utensils, customs and rituals, dress styles, art, dance, literature, music (Giles et al. 2009), and so forth, while other intergroup situations (e.g., artificially constructed laboratory groups) constitute social categories that cannot claim such cultural artifacts (Fortman &amp; Giles 2006). Reading, thinking, and research are needed at interfaces between the all too independent fields of intercultural communication on the one hand, and intergroup communication on the other (see, however, Gudykunst et al. 1988). Intercultural communication is not subsumed under, or even a special case of, intergroup communication, but rather the two are parallel traditions capable of significant coalescence.",

      "abstract": "Industrial relations, more than other social life areas, are fundamenting themselves on cooperation, cohesion and orienting their behaviour towards an economic (common) finality. From time to time, the structures of cooperation are melting, employees and employers finding themselves on opposite sides. Workers have many options of action – individual or collective – to resolve work miscontents. The collective option and the starting of the work conflict are depending on a variety of variables: the sector of activity (public or private). The type of industry, the size of the firm (number of employees), the degree of workers’ organization level (the existing number of unions), the type of management, the motive of divergences (wages, working conditions, etc.), and the proportion of miscontent workers, etc. Statistics on work conflicts are revealing only the “tip of the iceberg”. But conflicts have also a hidden dimension, detectable only by social research. It’s not just about ruptures and clivager in the social structure. The population’s perception on conflicts between employees and manager (employers), when shared by large social segments, are becoming social constructs, resilient to change and which are influencing the behaviour the principal actors within the industrial relations.",

      "abstract": "Pocos discutirán que la cultura es importante para el desarrollo de la comunidad. Pero, a diferencia de los objetivos de desarrollo tradicionales como los de salud y educación, el valor de las artes y la cultura para el desarrollo es mucho más amplio y conceptualmente diverso. En un extremo del espectro están los beneficios económicos bien reconocidos del turismo cultural y de las industrias artísticas; en el otro extremo, los beneficios de las artes y la cultura en el fomento de la participación y la inclusión social en la participación comunitaria, que son igualmente valiosos, pero menos visibles. En los últimos años he estado involucrado en el desarrollo de respuestas profesionales de desarrollo comunitario en varios contextos comunitarios llevados a cabo en Bangladesh, Malasia y Sri Lanka. He encontrado, particularmente en los niveles estatal/directivos, una mezcla de bienvenida y cautela, pero también, en ocasiones, algún resentimiento, preocupación y, en su mayoría, disimulada frustración por la brecha entre lo que promete el desarrollo comunitario y lo que puede ofrecer. Sin embargo, en términos generales estas expresiones parecen no tener un cauce adecuado. Aunque viniendo de un fondo bien acostumbrado a formas de condescendencia como medio para la explotación y la pacificación, me encontré simpatizando con tales respuestas, incluso valorándolas como honestas y clarificadoras. Lo que he obtenido ha sido tanto deseado como indeseado al mismo tiempo. Es resonante de la confusión intelectual identificada por muchos que escriben sobre la situación postcolonial, tal vez la más adecuada por Fanon (1965, 1967). Aunque este artículo se centra en gran medida en las cuestiones que surgen en el desarrollo del trabajo comunitario en el Reino Unido, sostengo esencialmente que estos procesos tienen sus homólogos en el sur y sudeste de Asia, particularmente en términos de la relación entre el desarrollo comunitario y el estado. De hecho, son más explícitos en el contexto de estados que son más abiertamente represivos y menos sutiles que el británico.",

      "title": "Language and organization",
      "abstract": "Can you imagine a human organization without a name?This simple thought experiment reveals how language and organization are intrinsically connected.Organizing implies the development and maintenance of regular patterns of interaction, and the conceptual and material activities involved in planning, acquiring resources, negotiating with internal and external stakeholders, coordinating action, etc. that constitute any contemporary organization, would not be possible in the absence of a sophisticated communication system.Any activity performed in a contemporary organization, be it a government agency, a corporate body, or a not for profit organization, demands the agency of language.In the absence of place names, signs, written policies, rules, procedures and a myriad of oral performances any organization would become effectively mute.It is only through linguistic construction that we can, individually and socially, make sense of the phenomena that we label 'organized activities'.While simple communicative interactions (expressing threats or friendliness, conveying elementary meaning, etc.) do not require a codified language to be performed, organized behaviour is founded on the use of a sophisticated sign system, allowing the transfer of articulated meanings.The relationship between communication and language is not one of one-directional causation: as organizations are a product of language, so in the modern world language embeds organizations.A precondition for conceiving and understanding ideas that we consider commonplace, such as 'rule', 'money', 'market', 'sport', 'authority', is the tacit acknowledgement of a multiplicity of organizations.Taken-for-granted actions such as boarding a train, sitting in a lecture or attending an event imply the active participation of the subject in a complex network of organized actions involving a multitude of human and non-human agents (Latour 2005).Consequently the specific ways of organizing transactions of a given human society define the way in which we talk about and understand things.Even an apparently simple idea such as 'buying lunch' for a friend, could never be conceived by a member of a hunter-gatherer tribe,",

      "title": "GROUP THEORIES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL DECISION MAKING",
      "abstract": "The group is studied in various domains such as economics, management, psychology, sociology, anthropology etc. The group can be defined as a set of people who communicate with each other, often for a predetermined period of time. The communication offers the possibility of interaction among members, allowing interpersonal consensus. Communication, interaction and consensus help common goals. The group is an important tool that helps the organization and the individual to achieve their goals. Researches related to group are focused more on the relationships and interpersonal distances between individuals, which directly influence the climate created within the group and its impact on the quality of the decisions made. Researchers argue that the established relationships and the distance between individuals are determined by interaction dynamics such as culture, gender, roles, statuses etc.Groups can be formed for several motivations: to share values and attitudes, to meet different needs, to make important decisions etc. Organizational performance is determined by the decisions and their effective implementation. More and more, organizations have to decide for new situations, never faced in the past. The dynamism of the environment, the uncertainty and ambiguity are today considered normal conditions in which managers must make a choice. These contextual characteristics orient companies to the use of groups. Group decision-making diminishes the weight of the decision-making process, because of the distribution of responsibilities and on the other hand many studies have confirmed that the groups lead to better decisions. But is it true that the decisions of the group are more effective than those of the individual?The aim of this paper is to discuss on some of the group theories in order to understand if the group decision-making is better than an individual process. By analyzing the different theories and the way in which the group is perceived, it is possible to draw some conclusions about the effectiveness of the group decision-making. So, the Field Theory underlines that the relationship between the individual and the group is interdependent, and a consequence of the current situation, the characteristics of the group and the individual, as well as of the external environment characteristics. This means that none of them and in particular the contextual factors should be underestimated during the decision-making process. The Social Exchange Theory believes that the functioning and effectiveness of the group are influenced by external and internal factors. In addition, interaction among members is considered important. To make good decisions, the members must have the opportunity to interact with each other. Such interactions change over time if change roles, tasks and emotions. The Realistic Conflict Theory focuses on the interdependence of tasks, interests and goals too different as the main reasons for conflicts between and within groups. Referring to the decision making, conflicts often lead to delays. The Theory of Social Influence highlights other aspects of the group’s functioning such as the pressure exerted by the group on the individual to conform. Under these conditions the decisions made when the individual is member of a group are too different from those that would be taken if the individual had to decide alone. The theory of the social identity tries to understand whether the behavior of the individual within a group depends on the belonging feelings. The higher is the degree of belonging, the greater is the favoritism for the ingroup.",

This is not the difference between political and apolitical uses of nicknames: agreement is a political act, the result of social negotiation, in which the nickname is a token. Agreement is a matter of pragmatics and politeness, so a theory of nicknames and nicknaming depends on the pragmatics of nicknames and the politeness structures implicated in them, rather than conventional logico-semantic accounts of names. Negotiation of social power within the constraints of speech acts and maxims of politeness leads to iterations of “naming contracts” between named and namer, such that nicknames are politically focusing social objects.",

But these interactions are shaped by cultural expectations, hierarchies, organizational commands, and formal and informal rituals; individuals tend to have emotions that are socially appropriate and predictable. So when most members of a group (almost never all of them) feel or display the same emotions at the same time, the reason is not some group mind or automatic contagion (although contagion does exist). It is that the same expectations, social structures, and interactive processes are affecting all of them.

At most we can say that some indicators belong mainly to the social sphere (e.g. school performance, sporting performance), while others (e.g. exchange rate, productivity) are mainly economic phenomena, or that economic indicators deal mainly with things and money while social indicators are more concerned with people.",

      "title": "Wechselwirkungen, Kompensationen und Ambivalenzen von Nicht/Anerkennung im Lebenszusammenhang prekär Beschäftigter",
      "abstract": "Nach Axel Honneths (1994, 2003, 2011) Anerkennungstheorie sind die Menschen zwingend auf intersubjektive Anerkennung durch andere angewiesen, denn nur in der Bestatigung durch andere konnen sie ein ungestortes Selbstverhaltnis entwickeln. So streben die Menschen nach Anerkennung fur das, was sie tun, und hierfur ist in gegenwartigen westlichen Gesellschaften Erwerbsarbeit eine wesentliche Quelle. Zum anderen mochten sie Anerkennung ihres hochstpersonlichen So-Seins, wofur Nah- und Paarbeziehungen zentral sind. Anerkennung ist allerdings ungleich verteilt (Wimbauer 2012) wie etwa nach beruflicher Position, (Aus-)Bildung, Migrationshintergrund oder Geschlecht in der Erwerbssphare. Nicht erwerbstatige Menschen sind von Anerkennung aus der Erwerbssphare komplett ausgeschlossen. Wie gestalten sich die Anerkennungsverhaltnisse bei prekar Beschaftigten? Prekare Beschaftigungsverhaltnisse gehen zumindest potentiell mit Anerkennungsdefiziten einher, die vielfaltig zum Ausdruck kommen konnen: Befristete Beschaftigungsformen, Beschaftigungen in Teilzeit, als Leiharbeiter*in, im Niedriglohn- und Niedrigeinkommensbereich sind oft mit unsicheren und schlechten Arbeitsbedingungen verbunden, mit geringen Einkommen und wenig Selbstverwirklichungsmoglichkeiten (Motakef 2015). In dem Vortrag, der diesem Beitrag zugrunde lag, fokussierten wir aus einer Perspektive auf den gesamten Lebenszusammenhang Anerkennung bei prekar Beschaftigten: Kann fehlende Anerkennung in der Erwerbssphare durch Anerkennung in personlichen Nahbeziehungen oder anderweitig abgefedert oder sogar ausgeglichen werden? Unsere theoretischen Grundlagen sind Axel Honneths Spharentheorie der Anerkennung, die wir um prekarisierungs- und anerkennungstheoretische Uberlegungen von Judith Butler erganzen. Mit Butler entwickeln wir dabei eine Sensibilitat fur Ambivalenzen und Paradoxien von Anerkennungsverhaltnisse und fragen nach der Bedeutung der Rahmen der Anerkennbarkeit. Wir stellten erste Ergebnisse aus dem Projekt „Ungleiche Anerkennung? ‚Arbeit‘ und ‚Liebe‘ im Lebenszusammenhang prekar Beschaftigter“ (DFG AZ Wi2142/5-1) vor. Befragt wurden acht prekar Beschaftigte, die nicht in einer Paarbeziehung leben und sieben prekar beschaftigte Paare in narrativ-(paar-)bio­gra­phi­schen Paar- und Einzelinterviews zu den unterschiedlichsten Lebensbereichen. Aus Platzgrunden beschranken wir uns hier auf Ergebnisse zu prekar Beschaftigten Singles. Wenn wir von Lebenszusammenhang sprechen, fokussieren wir in diesem Beitrag Wechselwirkungen zwischen Erwerbsarbeit, Nahbeziehungen sowie Selbstsorge. Wir zeigten, dass Nichtanerkennungsprozesse im Lebenszusammenhang nicht als einseitig kausale Phanomene zu verstehen sind. Das heist, Anerkennungsdefizite in der Erwerbssphare, die sich bei allen befragten prekar beschaftigten Singles auffinden liesen, fuhren nicht automatisch zu Nichtanerkennung etwa auch in Nahbeziehungen, kulminieren also nicht notwendig. Vielmehr zeigen sich komplexe Wechselwirkungen im gesamten Lebenszusammenhang und Ambivalenzen von Nicht/Anerkennung. Wir stellten zwei Konstellationen solcher Wechselwirkungen anhand exemplarischer Falle (Veronika V. und Ulrike U.) vor: 1. Gelungene Kompensation oder Verertraglichung beruflicher Nichtanerkennung: Zwei der acht Befragten verfugen uber eine biographisch bedingte berufliche ‚Nichtanerkennungsresistenz‘ und konnen subjektiven Sinn und Anerkennung auch jenseits von prekarer Erwerbsarbeit und einer nicht vorhandenen Partnerschaft generieren. Anerkennungsdefizite in der Erwerbssphare werden hier also etwa durch Freundschaften oder alternative Sinnorientierungen ansatzweise kompensiert oder (temporar) verertraglicht. Wie wir anhand des Fallbeispiels Veronika zeigen, ist dies nur im Lebenszusammenhang, also unter Berucksichtigung weiterer Lebensbereiche, zu verstehen. 2. keine Kompensation, sondern ambivalente Anerkennung: Doch es gibt auch Falle, in denen berufliche Nichtanerkennung weniger deutlich oder nicht durch Anerkennung in anderen soziale Beziehungen oder durch Selbstanerkennung verertraglicht oder kompensiert wird. Insbesondere kommen bei einigen der befragten Singles korperliche Einschrankungen, chronische Krankheiten und/oder psychische Belastungen zur prekaren Arbeitssituation hinzu, was sich zu Verlaufskurven und Ausschlussen aus der Erwerbs- wie aus der ‚Liebessphare‘ verdichten kann. Hierbei gibt es Falle, in denen eine zu Erwerbsarbeit alternative Sinnorientierung gar nicht existiert bzw. nicht geschaffen werden kann oder bei denen sich Kompensationsversuche von Nichtanerkennung in der Er­werbs- und Paarbeziehungssphare durch alternative Vergemeinschaf­tungen als fragil, ambivalent und teils selbstdestruktiv gestalten. Auch dies veranschaulichen wir an einem exemplarischen Fall.",

      "title": "So how do we talk about social class? Language, identity and the expression of class judgements in British culture",
      "abstract": "Although measures of social class have changed in recent years, the UK remains a class-bound society where social class influences one’s life chances by shaping opportunities in education and employment. Class, along with gender and ethnicity, is an integral part of identity yet we struggle to talk about our own social class and feel uncomfortable in expressing judgements on the social class of others. Talking about social class is problematic because it revolves around the relative worth and economic value of individuals and is a source of both status and stigma (Sayer 2002). Indeed, although sentiments around class have not changed, the language and explicit naming of class has all but disappeared from social and political discourse (Skeggs 2005).\r\nThis paper explores how individuals in research interviews negotiate the linguistic expression of social class judgements while simultaneously managing their own class identity. The analysis focuses on moments of difficulty (van der Bom and Mills 2015) where speakers struggle to express their experiences of class, in order to identify the linguistic strategies used to negotiate class talk. These strategies are discussed by drawing on social models of politeness as the “active expression of that person’s social positioning in relation to others” (Eelen, 2001, 224) as well as the evolving sociological understanding of class identity. \r\nThe findings suggest that speakers are caught in a delicate balancing act in which they strive to maintain the conversational contract of the interview while adhering to cultural expectations of acceptable talk. This involves a complicated process of identity protection in which the speaker’s knowledge of what is considered culturally acceptable/unacceptable discourse at the macro level of British culture works with their understanding of the etiquette of the interview as an interactional context to constrain what is ‘sayable’ about social class at the micro level.",

      "title": "Levels of interpersonal trust across different types of environment: The micro–macro interplay between relational distance and human ecology.",
      "abstract": "Social and behavioral scientists have long investigated the relationship between interpersonal trust and features of the environment. However, it remains unclear how the microenvironment of relational distance (i.e., social proximity between 2 persons) interacts with the macroenvironment of human ecology (i.e., social and natural environments) to predict people's levels of trusting other persons. In this research, we tackled this puzzle using diverse methodologies (e.g., meta-analysis, experiment, and multilevel analysis) and large, cultural-group samples. Four studies found that, across many countries (e.g., 77 countries in Study 3) and regions within a country (e.g., 28 Chinese provinces in Study 4), members of these social units trusted close others (e.g., family members) more than distant others (e.g., strangers). However, this general effect of relational distance was stronger in societies embedded within more restrictive cultural, sociopolitical, and natural ecologies (e.g., a more collectivistic cultural logic, less developed socioeconomic and political institutions, and a stronger threat of infectious diseases, such as HCV infection). More importantly, people's attitudinal trust of distant others was higher in countries or regions with less restrictive ecocultural features, but such differences often disappeared in the context of trusting close others. Compared with other sociopolitical and natural features, the societal culture of collectivism often was a unique explanatory variable for the micro-macro interplay of current interest. These converging pieces of evidence provide a clear view of how levels of interpersonal trust vary as a function of relational distance and ecocultural environments simultaneously.

The communities can grow by recruiting new members, or contract by loosing members; two (or more) groups may merge into a single community, while a large enough social group can split into several smaller ones; new communities are born and old ones may disappear.

      "abstract": "Competition for resources is the fundamental process generating selection on social behaviour. Individuals compete with family members, with other conspecifics, and with the members of other species for food, shelter and other resources that are essential for survival and reproduction. Conspecifics also compete for access to social partners and mates, and hence selection acting on strategies of social competition is particularly intense (West-Eberhard 1979). However, competition is not simply a repellent force in the lives of organisms, driving them apart; it is often a social attractor, bringing individuals together and setting the stage for social evolution. In particular, where resources such as food and mates are clumped in the environment or predictable in time, competition has the effect of drawing individuals together into aggregation and possible social interaction, selecting for strategies that maximize fitness by exploiting, parasitizing, following, or even cooperating with other individuals of the same or different species.",

It is not intended to imply (as some readers have thought) that it is enough for social workers to understand the individual, even within his family and his sub- cultural setting. Clearly the social worker also needs a knowledge of society per se, its power structure, its administrative structure and its economic system; a knowledge of the processes of social change, of how to intervene effectively to relieve economic, social and educational deprivation; and, I would add, some skill in predicting the unintended side-effects of such intervention. However, in what follows we are concerned with that element in the education of social workers which is concerned with human personality and interaction, whether within the family, the small group or the community.",

      "abstract": "The modern era can rightly be called the era of criticism.All that can be done can be done better; therefore, almost any achievement or decision, primarily of politicians and entrepreneurs (but not least of all of scientists, designers, architects, writers and even people of art), is accompanied by protest or criticized.Achievements or decisions either affect personal rights, or threaten the environment, or damage cultural, gender, national or religious identities.At the same time, protest should be presented in a bright visual form.Any protest slogan should receive an additional symbolic refinement or extension.Symbols can be understandable or require few thinking efforts; and both these conditions should not harm the overall transparency of the protest function.These symbols of protest oppose metaphorically encoded video sequences to the complex party programs.The decoding of protest symbols is not difficult (\"anything goes\") and provides a general understanding and unity of the protesters (or its illusion that, in general, does not change things).The symbolic visualization of the unifying values of protest (e.g., of the collective rejection of suffering or of the rights loss) and its decoding compensate the lack of a generalized symbolic means of communication, which is a guaranteed means of achieving communicative success.Such a symbolic visualization would ensure that any participant of protest communication has their contact request accepted, that is, addressed to other participants.Such communicatively generalizing symbols or media (power, truth, money, faith) belong to classical macro-systems (the ones of politics, science, economy, religion), which allows these systems to solve the main communicative problem, to provide collective actions, and to coordinate common interests and decisions.But protest communication, on the contrary, is dispersed into several heterogeneous key topics.The debate on these topics integrates communities and institutionalizes these communications into such social movements as feminism, environmentalism, anti-globalism, etc.However, unlike the clear communicative symbols of the political and economic systems, the absence of such a generalizing symbol in protest communication is not a competitive advantage.In the article, the authors consider the communicative and symbolic resources of protest communication that have been developed during the Internet network epoch as a functional compensation for its thematic fragmentation in the absence of a single unifying symbol.",

In addition, potential explanatory mechanisms have not been investigated. This study examined both the social distribution of social support and the role of life events in the association between SES and social support in a nationally representative probability sample of adults from the National Cormorbidity Survey. Higher education and income were related to more emotional support and fewer negative interactions. Individuals with higher incomes were also less likely to report acute and chronic life events. Finally, acute (but not chronic) life events mediated the relation between SES and social support (both emotional support and negative interactions). These results suggest the inability of lower SES individuals to mobilize social support in times of need may be explained by their more frequent experience of acute life events.",

      "abstract": "Argumention is often considered as a way to transmit explicit information. However, in daily context-based activities, argumentation practices are embedded in discussions where many norms, beliefs, and values are taken for granted. Our objective is to evaluate the consequences of this daily argumentative processes in terms of socialization. More specifically, we focus on family mealtime conversations and analyze the structure of argumentations thanks to an ideographic methodology based on two models: the pragma-dialectical ideal model of critical discussion (van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004) and the Argumentum Model of Topics (Rigotti & Greco Morasso, 2010).\r\n\r\nThe results, based on a corpus of 30 video-recorded separate meals of 10 middle to upper-middle-class Swiss and Italian families, indicate that implicits in argumentation are particularly effective in transmitting what is taken for granted in any given cultural community. This efficiency relies on the fact that presuppositions, i.e. background information not explicitly indicated as relevant, appear as unquestionable. Children, who are largely dependent on adults for their well-being as well as for their knowledge acquisition, are not in a position to call into question these presuppositions. Moreover, in the absence of the background necessary to understand an argument, children have to figure out (initially vaguely) a certain context that enables them to make sense of the ongoing dialogue. This background will progressively be enriched thanks to other interactions. Therefore the chances that many aspects of what is taken for granted in any given families will be maintained in the next generation are particularly high. \r\n\r\nThe results of this study can contribute to the wider theme of argumentative practices and debates in societal and family issues. Family interactions constitute a favorable discursive arena involving children and adults through different intersubjective positions that are shaped by socio-cultural and interpersonal factors within the contingent context of the discussion. Assuming the perspective of argumentation as cultural activity contributes not only to give conditions for defining development, but also to frame the context in which the development is supported.",

(Meyrowitz, 1985) Space has its own reality in the current mode of production and society, with the same claims and in the same global process as merchandise, money, and capital. Natural space is irreversibly gone. And although it of course remains as the origin of the social process, nature is now reduced to materials on which society's productive forces operate …. Spatial practice defines its space, it poses it and presupposes it in a dialectical interaction. Social space has thus always been a social product, but this was not recognized. (Lefebvre, 1979) When [the child] shifts to a second stage of listening … that of meaning, what is listened for is no longer the possible (the prey, the threat, or the object of desire which occurs without warning), it is the secret; that which, concealed in reality, can reach human consciousness only through a code, which serves simultaneously to encipher and to decipher that reality.

      "abstract": "Les inegalites sont souvent definies a partir de l'adjectif qui les qualifie. Elles sont sociales (Bourdieu, 1966), scolaires (Duru-Bellat, Van Zanten, 2009), educatives (Perier, 2007), culturelles (Lahire, 2004) ou numeriques (Granjon, 2009) et renvoient au fait que les capitaux sont inegalement distribues dans l'espace social. Cela entraine une hierarchie des positions sociales des individus ou, face a la possibilite de s'emanciper, l'inegalite touche ceux qui subissent (Bihr, Pfefferkorn, 2008).Si les inegalites numeriques s'integrent plus largement dans la definition des inegalites, la realite de la vie sociale des individus et leurs pratiques numeriques sont dans un rapport dialectique. Une continuite existe entre les pratiques off et on line (Granjon, 2009 ; Casilli, 2010 ; Fontar, 2010). Ainsi, interroger les inegalites numeriques necessite de questionner les rapports entre institutions, representations et usages. Le Mentec (2010 et ANR INEDUC1) interrogera l'articulation institutions/usages en montrant dans quelle mesure les institutions d'aide a l'insertion renforcent les phenomenes d'exclusion a travers la mise en place de dispositifs techniques presupposant des savoir-faire chez les usagers. Plus largement, la relation d'aide proposee s'etablit sur un rapport dominant-domine creant une forme d'inegalite qui touche les capacites d'actions des personnes.Fontar (2010 et ANR INEDUC) questionnera le rapport representations/usages en montrant que la tyrannie de la majorite (Pasquier, 2005) creee une norme sociale pouvant generer des difficultes d’appropriation chez les adolescents. La pression sociale a « devoir y etre » ne sous-entend pas necessairement des competences developpees ni des usages varies. Elle s'attachera a deconstruire le mythe du « Digital Natives » (Prensky, 2001) qui presuppose implicitement une inneite des pratiques et voile le role des apprentissages.Ainsi, cette proposition de communication contribue a relativiser les visions enchantees du numerique (notamment ces bienfaits emancipatoires) en en montrant son pouvoir de renforcement des inegalites sociales.",

When politicians, protesters, or politically engaged entertainers appear in public, they perform political representation. When statues of historical figures are put in the urban space, when people get together to deliberate in an institutional building, when they symbolically occupy the streets or find a virtual space in the media, a performative space of representation is configured. Relations of representation do not exist, passively; they are created (and for that matter, are challenged and disrupted) actively, forged through practice and performance. Representation is a ‘doing’ before it is a ‘being’; it is a performing of claims and counterclaims to speak or to stand for others. Performing is intrinsic to and constitutes representation, shaping the ways in which we conceive roles and institutions and imagine society and democracy. Performing representation is a dynamic exercise generating polysemic outcomes. How can performances of representation be analysed? And when are they democratic? Bodies, Spaces, Claims addresses these and a range of further questions on political representation by proposing theoretical approaches, analysing empirical material, and offering analytical tools for understanding the performativity of political representation.",

Thus, more broadly, their scope is not limited to their content alone, but more broadly to their inclusion in social advocacy dynamics. These are not binding rules in legal terms, so their meaning and their implications are more global.

At the same time, the situation of socially disadvantaged groups of the population, among which the person with disabilities (hereinafter - the disabled) occupies a leading place, as the former mechanisms of solving problems do not work, and the new ones have not yet been formed, is worsening. Such people constantly have feelings of unsettlement, helplessness, and impasse, which cause the emergence of aggressive reactions, and sometimes complete indifference. As a result, social tension develops in relationships in society, which becomes a source of threat to social security, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and military operations, which leads to overloaded health care systems with an increased number of hospitalizations and deaths.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We aimed to understand the cues individuals use to assess social class, and their relation to social theories. Participant ( N = 235) open‐ended survey responses were coded in response to the following: “ If you can at least sometimes tell if someone is (#1) working‐class/poor OR (#2) middle‐/upper‐class, how can you tell? What are all of the characteristics, behaviors, and/or other indicators that communicate their social class to you?” Based on participant comments, we created six themes: embodied cultural capital, material/economic capital, taste, status/position, institutional cultural capital, and social capital. First, we found spontaneous participant responses reflected several classic social class theories. Second, while the content often differed in terms of how participants discussed the working‐class/poor compared to the middle‐/upper‐class, there was only one significant difference in frequency of response. Specifically, participants were more likely to express the embodied cultural capital theme when asked about the working‐class/poor. Finally, participants with some more privileged identities (e.g., racially white, those with higher education, straight/heterosexual participants) were more likely to focus on symbolic or non‐material aspects of class compared to participants with some less privileged identities (e.g., participants with lower incomes in their families of origin), who focused more on material and economic cues in determining a person's class.",

It focuses on the definition of the concept and the life areas in which the target group views it as important to take part in.In guided group interviews (N=6), 20 young adults with and without disabilities were surveyed about their perception of participation. To also include people with more severe disabilities, proxy interviews (N=3) were conducted. The data of the interview were analyzed via qualitative content analysis based on Mayring.Participation is understood as being multifaceted and individually different. Six aspects of participation definition could be detected: togetherness; social inclusion/participation in society; open-mindedness/interest; equal opportunities/equal treatment; freedom of choice/autonomy; to have a voice. Besides that, seven areas of participation were mentioned as important for young adults: social environment; work/education; leisure; media; mobility; politics/finances; self-administration.Within young adults' complex perception of participation, social aspects are particularly important, besides equal rights and autonomy. Participation in sexuality and new media is given a crucial value, which is why these topics should be given more attention to. Life areas in which participation is described as relevant can vary depending on the interests of the individual. This demonstrates the subjective character of the concept, and the importance to consider the perception and preference of a person or a group.ZIEL: Die Studie untersucht die subjektiven Vorstellungen junger Erwachsener von Teilhabe.

Teilhabe ist für die Befragten in sieben Lebensbereichen bedeutsam: soziales Umfeld; Arbeit/Bildung; Freizeit; Medien; Mobilität; Politik; Finanzen/Selbstverwaltung.In den komplexen Vorstellungen junger Erwachsener von Teilhabe sind insbesondere soziale Aspekte sowie Gleichberechtigung und Selbstbestimmung von Bedeutung. Teilhabe im Bereich Sexualität und neue Medien wird ein entscheidender Wert beigemessen, weshalb diese vermehrt Beachtung finden sollten. Die Lebensbereiche, in denen Teilhabe als relevant beschrieben wird, können je nach Interessen des Individuums variieren, was auf den subjektiven Charakter des Konzeptes hinweist und die Bedeutsamkeit aufzeigt, die jeweiligen Vorstellungen und Präferenzen einer Person oder Personengruppe zu berücksichtigen.",

      "abstract": "Social exclusion can be distinguished from social isolation, defining social isolation as the phenomenon of non-participation (of an individual or group) in a society's mainstream institutions, while reserving 'social exclusion' for the subset of cases in which social isolation occurs for reasonsthat are beyond the control of those subject to it. The familiar form of social exclusion affects those who are unable to participate in the institutions patronised by the majority. There is also, however, exclusion of the majority by a minority who are in a position to opt out of the mainstream institutions: the epitome of this is the 'gated community'. Social exclusion is a violation of the demands of social justice in two ways: it conflicts with equality of opportunity and is associated with an inability to participate effectively in politics. An alternative account of what is wrong with social exclusion is that it undermines social solidarity. Voluntary social isolation has the same effect, but is less likely to have such adverse consequences. The relation between social exclusion and the distribution of income is not the same in all societies. However, for a society such as that of Britain, it seems plausible that to avoid the social exclusion of a minority it is necessary for nobody to have less than half the median income, and that to avoid the social exclusion of the majority it is necessary for only a few to have more than three times the median income.",

This means focusing on the social determinants of health and the complex individual, community and environmental interactions that influence health and wellbeing. Health promotion research and practice recognizes that social change is not linear and involves multiple communities of interest working together in a coordinated manner in order to address health problems. An approach that acknowledges this non-linear system of interaction in its data gathering, strategic planning, and program implementation is necessary to addressing this complexity in practice.Concepts such as chaos theory, self-organization, social emergence can inform how health promotion is practiced at multiple levels. Evaluation approaches such as social network analysis, system dynamics modeling combined with social organizing strategies like communities of practice and unconferences provide opportunities to leverage social capital effectively to promote health in complex environments with diverse populations.Health promotion's focus on the multi-layered, complex interactions that create or limit health and wellbeing require knowledge and action that match this complexity. Approaches to engagement and evaluation that are based on systems theories and methodologies provide the means of addressing this complexity, while framing health promotion as a systems science and practice.",

      "title": "Socially interacting or indifferent neighbours? Randomization of movement paths to tease apart social preference and spatial constraints",
      "abstract": "Summary Understanding how animals interact with their physical and social environment is a major question in ecology, but separating between these factors is often challenging. Observed interaction rates may reflect social behaviour – preferences or avoidance of conspecifics or certain phenotypes. Yet, environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity also affects individual space use and interaction rates. For instance, clumped and ephemeral resources may force individuals to aggregate independently of sociality. Proximity‐based social networks ( PBSN s) are becoming increasingly popular for studying social structures thanks to the parallel improvement of biotracking technologies and network randomization methods. While current methods focus on swapping individual identities among network nodes or in the data streams that underlies the network (e.g. individuals movement paths), we still need better tools to distinguish between the contribution of sociality and other factors towards those interactions. We propose a novel method that randomizes path segments among different time stamps within each individual separately (Part I). Temporal randomization of whole path segments (e.g. full days) retains their original spatial structure while decoupling synchronization among individuals. This allows researchers to compare observed dyadic association rates with those expected by chance given explicit space use of the individuals in each dyad. Further, since environmental changes are commonly much slower than the duration of social interactions, we can differentiate between these two factors (Part II). First, an individual's path is divided into successive time windows (e.g. weeks), and days are randomized within each time window. Then, by exploring how the deviations between randomized and observed networks change as a function of time window length, we can refine our null model to account also for temporal changes in the activity areas. We used biased‐correlated random walk models to simulate populations of socially indifferent or sociable agents for testing our method for both false‐positive and negative errors. Applying the method to a data set of GPS‐tracked sleepy lizards ( Tiliqua rugosa ) demonstrated its ability to reveal the social organization in free‐ranging animals while accounting for confounding factors of environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We demonstrate that this method is robust to sampling bias and argue that it is applicable for a wide range of systems and tracking techniques, and can be extended to test for preferential phenotypic assortment within PBSN s.",

This model resonates with the institutional structure of politics and law in the United States in which adversaries battle each other in a rule-governed \"game,\" a contest ultimately evaluated by judges assumed to be impartial. To understand the process by which adolescents gain the skills to construct social problems, I conducted an ethnographic study of debate teams at two high schools. The ability to take both sides of an argument, express ideas with which one does not personally agree, and present powerful, if questionable, evidence, constrained by time, teaches teenagers how to engage in social problem discourse and provides a training ground for moral entrepreneurs.",

Under this catchword the full time establishments (institutions, psychiatric clinics with oligophrenic departments and homes) for the mentally handicapped are also considered, but equally critically.

It is often assumed that social innovation can lead to social change (see, for example, Cooperrider and Pasmore, 1991; Mulgan et al., 2007; BEPA, 2010). However, the relationship between social innovation and social change remains underexplored: Rather than being used as a specifically defined specialist term with its own definable area of studies, social innovation is used more as a kind of descriptive metaphor in the context of phenomena of real world problems, social change, and the modernisation of society.

      "abstract": "The question of language ownership is most relevant in multilingual societies which are characterised by power imbalances among speakers of different languages. Bourdieu (1991, 1997) has argued that verbal exchanges take place in inequitable markets where speech acts are assigned different symbolic values. Within any sociolinguistic community, certain ways of using language are considered proper, educated, standard or legitimate, while others are not. According to Bourdieu, legitimacy is determined not so much by intrinsically superior linguistic features, but by power relations: the language of the elite is imposed as the norm and functions as a gate-keeper. Mastery of this language is a precondition for claiming symbolic and material resources. One could even argue that, while overt racism is becoming less acceptable in democratic societies, linguicism, or discrimination based on language (Phillipson 1991), continues to reign undisturbed as an alleged politically correct mechanism for re(producing) social stratification (Parmegiani 2006a).",

There are groups at risks of exclusion in a society still dominated by prejudices and stereotypes in each category. Among these groups is the LGBTQI+ community since people who do not follow sexual and gender norms tend to be punished with bullying and hidden curricula in school environments (Elipe et al., 2015). The existence of social inequality in these areas creates barriers that make it difficult for vulnerable groups to integrate into social contexts, such as academia (Pichardo &amp; Puche, 2019).There are physical barriers, like non-accessibility in common spaces, bureaucratic barriers with the absence of clear and known protocols, and symbolic barriers due to a shortage of positive references or models.",

      "abstract": "POSITION PAPER Computer-based social network services are and will remain dominating tools for enlarging social networks thanks to their positive and despite their negative features or impacts. Key words: social network, social networking service, tools for social networking Apology ISCSC apologizes for inadvertently omitting this position paper from the Proceedings of the 2009 conference. It is accordingly presented in the Journal. 1. Introduction Communication is the essential fabric of social life, and only entities that communicate are able to create societies. Communication is necessary for coordination of all kinds of social activities on many levels, from families up to the level of international organizations. A social network is a social structure made of nodes (which are generally individuals or organizations) that are tied by one or more specific types of interdependencies, such as values, visions, ideas, financial exchange, friendship, sexual relationships, kinship, dislike, conflict or trade (Social network, 2009). Social networks include nodes - actors within the networks, and ties - the relationships between the actors. There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes, all of them predicated on the underlying communications mechanisms, since communication is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for creating social networks. Social network services (SNSes) axe services supporting social networking, and advanced SNSes are currently based on computer networks [Social network service, 2009]. We believe that SNSes are dominating tools for enlarging social networks in our civilization, and will be even more indispensable in the future due to development of ever more sophisticated SNSes. They have gained and will maintain this position thanks to their positive and despite their negative features or impacts; both should be well known to users wishing to fully utilize their potential without adverse consequences. To support these claims, we first present briefly the history and the present day of computer-based support for social networking (emphasizing modern computer-based SNSes). We then analyze positive and negative features and impacts of modern SNSes. 2. Early Technological Support for Social Networking Interactions within social networks can be facilitated by two kinds of services and technologies: (a) transportation facilities that support face-to-face social interactions - within a limited physical space; and (b) communication facilities that support virtual social interactions without an inherent restriction on location of the interacting entities. In the chronological order of their development, communication facilities include: postal technologies and services (with messenger services known already in ancient civilizations); telephone technologies and services (started in the 1870's but widespread only in the 20th century); computer communication technologies and services (started in the 1970's but widespread only in the 1990's). The evolution of computer-based networking tools includes many distinct stages such as: the ARPANET in the 1970s; the Internet in the 1980s; email and World Wide Web (WWW) in the 1990s; search engines (e.g., AltaVista, Google), wikis (e.g., Wikipedia), and social network services (e.g., Myspace, Facebook) in the 2000s. Despite the fact that social network services or SNSes (providing tools for enlarging human/social networks) blossomed only recently, the history of computer-based SNS predecessors can be traced back to 1969 when the ARPANET (a predecessor of the Internet) started its operation, and to 1979 when the Usenet (a worldwide distributed Internet discussion system with a hierarchy of topical categories named newsgroups) became available. From the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, bulletin board services (BBSes) were popular; originally BB Ses were accessed only via a dial-up connection but by the early 1990s some BBSes allowed access via a network connection. …",

To bridge this gap, we draw on existing literature to weave together practical advice and a host of mechanisms that can be utilised to increase innovativeness, from distant search to diversifying learning, recognising that social innovation is not a panacea and more needs to be done to ensure social entrepreneurs do no harm in their quest for social good.",

      "title": "Social Closure",
      "abstract": "“Social closure” is one of the most basic terms and concepts in sociology. Basically, closure refers to processes of drawing boundaries, constructing identities, and building communities in order to monopolize scarce resources for one’s own group, thereby excluding others from using them. Society is not a homogenous entity but is instead internally structured and subdivided by processes of social closure. Some social formations, such as groups, organizations, or institutions, may be open to everybody, provided they are capable of participation, while access to most others is limited due to certain criteria that either allow people to become members or exclude them from membership. Therefore, social closure is a ubiquitous, everyday phenomenon that can be observed in almost every sphere and place in the social world. Members of societies experience closure from the very beginning of their social life. To be excluded from certain groups starts at school, where presumably homogenous classes begin to subdivide into distinct peer groups or sports teams. Here, exclusion may be rather arbitrary, but the experience of having a door slammed in one’s face proceeds in cases, where inclusion depends on formal rules or preconditions. Access to private schools follows explicit rules and depends on financial capacities; access to university depends on a certificate or diploma, eventually from certain schools only; membership in a highly prestigious club depends on economic and social capital and the respective social networks; and finally, in the case of migration, people will have to be eligible for citizenship and pass the thorny path of naturalization. However, it is not just the enormous plurality of forms that makes social closure crucial for sociology. Rather, the process of closure of social relations—of groups, organizations, institutions, and even national societies—is the fundamental process of both “communal” (Vergemeinschaftung) and “associative” relationships (Vergesellschaftung), and neither would be possible without social closure. In this broad and fundamental sense, social closure is not restricted to processes in national societies. It even allows for understanding crucial processes of the way the social world is organized at the regional or global level.",

These problems are rarely discussed concerning their pathogenic or health-supporting effects. Transformations of society primarily change the relationship between the demands, expectations and requirements placed on the individual and his or her abilities and competencies necessary to find solutions. This challenge simulataneously offers chances and risks for an individual's personality development, namely new demands on an individual's regulation of potential and achievement. Not only is competence in the workplace required, but social skills, emotional and self-reflective qualities are vital as well. Developing these abilities requires two tasks.

Lack of corporate social and legal responsibility is not just a failure of corporate management. It is also a failure of legal regulatory institutions to interact with corporate organizations to make them open and permeable. Similarly, Community action often fails to permeate the corporate shell and engage with corporation's self-governance capacity. Corporate responsibility, or citizenship, is constituted in interaction between formal regulation (through the State), informal social action (the penumbra of democracy and institutions of civil society) and corporate self-regulation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The numerous problems and limitations that have affected the theoretical understanding of irregular migration cannot be simply related to a lack of empirical data or to the complexity of the phenomenon. Rather, they reveal important obstacles épistémologiques (Luhmann, 2007, p. 11) and conceptual problems that demand a reconsideration of many of the theoretical assumptions that have been generally used. Both the lack of differentiated analysis and the use of mono-causal explanations, which have been indicated as the most evident symptoms of theoretical ineffectiveness, have been linked to three broader and deeper causes. In particular: (a) a limited and often misguiding conception of society , usually subsumed within the concept of state; (b) the simplistic understanding of the different social actors and their interests; (c) the deterministic, cause-effect interpretation of social interactions . The extent and complexity of these issues, that evidently surpass the confines of the so-called migration studies, require a more general reflection on contemporary society and its functioning. From this perspective, international migration and, in our case, irregular migration, need to be considered as part and parcel, both products and determinants, of the broader social processes and structures. A satisfactory understanding of them can only be achieved in connection with a more general interpretation of contemporary society, one that critically reviews many important assumptions and preconceptions that have been imposed by the effects of methodological nationalism.",

      "title": "WHAT CAN I DO FOR THE WORLD? THE CONTENT AND EXPRESSIONS OF PERSONAL SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY",
      "abstract": "The modern world, along with the positive trends in socio-economic development, is characterized by many pressing global problems: social insecurity, financial instability, the depletion of natural resources, the threat of energy crisis, climatic changes, demographic issues, etc. The basis of stable positive changes in the mentioned above situation is the social responsibility as the fulfillment of obligations to society and liability for the consequences of their actions by the agents of social interaction – institutions, organizations, as well as communities and individual members of society. The research on social responsibility is mainly focused on the organizational level – the evaluation of performed activities and possibilities of a positive impact on the social well-being (environmental security, attractive financial stability, political security, and social communication) of the state, business organizations, scientific and religious institutions. Organizational members, being implementers and initiators of social responsibility for their organization, act as its representatives, but also as independent agents of social interactions. The potential of a person's positive impact on social well-being cannot be overestimated. The indications of individual social responsibility lay both within and beyond the professional responsibilities (in everyday activities that affect different aspects of life). The personal aspect of social responsibility is studied in the context of the specifics of society organization (both the responsibilities imposed on an individual and the demands to them from the society) and as a personal trait. The article describes the content and manifestations of a person's social responsibility within the framework of the dispositional approach. For this task, scientific publications in psychology and related fields (philosophy, pedagogy, sociology, and management) were reviewed. The basis of social responsibility as a personal trait is the acceptance by a person of the behavioral standards aimed at improving social well-being; a person's recognition of the importance of such standards for society; understanding the significance of their actions for other people and the natural environment; willingness to be responsible for their actions. Personal social responsibility is the willingness to voluntary actions, based on understanding and acceptance of their social significance, undertaking a duty to act for the benefit of society: participation in solution of social problems and preventing their occurrence in the near and distant future, while maintaining the personal welfare. The forms of a person's social responsibility manifestations, depending on the social well-being sphere, are distinguished. They include prosociality (a tendency towards socially beneficial actions manifested in tolerance, respect for the rights of others, and willingness to help them); responsible consumption (consumption without harm or with minimal impact on the environment; the support of social initiatives; economically favorable consumption that is appropriate for the potential of society and does not harm people's health); professional social responsibility (assistance to individuals, communities, and society as a whole through quality professional work, professional ethics, and high professional involvement) and responsibility for personal well-being. Socially responsible behavior can be regulated by psychological and non-psychological influence to spread the appropriate forms of behavior in society and to form its internalized norms. &nbsp",

      "abstract": "In Western societies, many polarized debates extend beyond the area of opinions, having consequences for social structures within society. Such segmentation of society into opinion-based groups may hinder communication, making it difficult to reconcile viewpoints across group boundaries. In three representative samples from Australia and the Netherlands ( N = 1,206), we examine whether perceived polarization predicts the quality (harmony, comfort, and experience of negative emotions) and quantity (avoidance of the issue) of communication with others in the community. We distinguish between perceived opinion differentiation (i.e., the extent to which opinions in society are divided) and perceived structural differentiation (i.e., the extent to which society fissions into subgroups). Results show that although opinion differentiation positively predicts the discussion of societal issues, the belief that these opinions reflect a deeper societal divide predicts negative communication expectations and intentions. We discuss how polarization perceptions may reinforce communicative behaviors that catalyze actual polarization processes.",

      "abstract": "Constructing Capacities: Building Capabilities through Learning and Engagement explores several contemporary manifestations of individuals, groups and communities participating in varying types of learning and thereby engaging effectively and productively with their contexts and environments in order to build and develop their multiple capacities. Those capacities are seen as crucial to overcoming particular kinds of challenges and to attaining specific types of aspirations that are valued highly by the respective individuals, groups and communities.\r\nDespite this common valuing of constructing capacities, we still know relatively little about how capacities can be built and enhanced in ways that are equitable, sustainable and transformative. Much of the literature highlights contextually specific factors that facilitate capacity building for particular groups of participants at specific times, and that are founded on demonstrated principles such as understanding and engaging with those participants’ respective aspirations, circumstances and needs. Yet what works to develop capabilities in one context might not succeed in another context, even with the same participants – generating momentum and achieving scale and sustainability are often challenges when seeking to build capacities.\r\nFor all these reasons, it is both timely and useful to extend contemporary understandings of capacities and how they can be constructed effectively and sustainably. The 14 chapters in this book take up this challenge by presenting theoretically framed and rigorously researched accounts of successful capacity-building in diverse educational settings, clustered around four foci:\r\n* conceptualising and contextualising capacities\r\n* constructing students' and teachers' capacities\r\n* constructing workers' capacities\r\n* constructing researchers' capacities.\r\nThese accounts generate new and important understandings of what capacities are, how they can be constructed and supported, and how they emhance positive outcomes for individuals and communities as well as nationally and globally.",

      "title": "Atravesar fronteras disciplinares: perspectivas estructuralistas e historicistas sobre las emociones",
      "abstract": "Existe un creciente consenso en torno a la importancia que tienen las emociones tanto en los procesos individuales, como podria ser la toma de decisiones, como en los grupales: desde la participacion y el desarrollo de movimientos sociales, a la formacion de identidades colectivas. Persisten, sin embargo, tensiones entre las distintas perspectivas teoricas. No hay acuerdo sobre que son las emociones, sobre como podemos estudiarlas, ni sobre el tipo de dinamicas sociales que dan cuenta de ellas. Son tensiones derivadas de las propias tradiciones disciplinares, de su manera de hacerse preguntas y de mirar a la realidad social. Me propongo aqui romper una lanza a favor de un dialogo transdisciplinar, por dificil que este pueda ser, entre las perspectivas mas sociologicas, en el sentido de mas estructuralistas, y aquellas mas culturalistas de las emociones. Para las primeras las emociones son el resultado de las interacciones entre actores con distinto poder y estatus (Kemper, 1987; Ekman, 1982; Barbalet, 1998 y 2002; Turner 2005), mientras que para los enfoques culturales e historicistas, las emociones forman parte de la urdimbre cultural de una determinada sociedad, y presentan variacion historica al estar sujetas a una interpretacion en la que las narraciones y los repertorios colectivos de expresion juegan un papel fundamental (Stearns & Stearns, 1985; Moravia, 1999; Wickberg, 2007; Kleinman & Fitz-Henry, 2007). Las emociones, de la misma manera que todos los procesos constitutivos de la subjetividad, presentan variacion historica, pero sin duda algunas de estas experiencias (verguenza, resentimiento, orgullo) requieren incluir un analisis que de cuenta de las formas, historicas tambien, de desigualdad en una sociedad. Asi pues, pese a que estas perspectivas partan de presupuestos epistemologicos y teoricos aparantemente irreconciliables, conviene rescatar la manera en que pueden cuestionarse una a la otra, para incorporar, precisamente, preguntas de investigacion de mayor riqueza a la hora de comprender la vida emocional de las sociedades.",

When addressing these challenges, disciplines related to public health have to overcome many issues related to cultural differences between providers and recipients of care, as well as lack of cultural sensitivity of professional practices and services (Ingleby et al , 2005). Such issues are frequently associated with the necessity to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and with the impossibility of disseminating and implementing ‘best practice’ models with underlying assumptions of socioeconomic and cultural capital homogeneity which have proved inadequate to address the needs of socially and culturally disadvantaged people (Wandersman, 2003).",

Sin embargo, esta clase de senalamientos no provienen unicamente de personas ajenos o distantes a la problematica: en la misma comunidad hay individuos que conjeturan sobre los jovenes que se han visto arrastrados, por muchas razones (como la violencia intrafamiliar, el consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, la falta de oportunidades,el rechazo social entre otras), a una vida —que podriamos llamar― ajena a las necesidades de la sociedad.\n?Como determinar la situacion de estos individuos?, ?como conocer al individuo y su potencial, mas alla de la primera impresion? Estas preguntas han sido motor de proyecto Garabateando que tiene como fin articular las practicas pedagogicas,con la realidad social y la busqueda de la identidad, de los jovenes que se encuentran inmersos en un escenario de estigmatizacion y rechazo. Desde su planteamiento inicial, el proyecto se fijo dos propositos: (1) identificar una serie de caracteristicas propias de la educacion visual-artistica de los jovenes de la comunidad del barrio El Brillante ubicado en la localidad de Usme y (2) hallar caracteristicas sociales,derivadas de las artisticas, que permitan que estos jovenes reconozcan su identidad social.\nEl proyecto,Garabateando.Gestion de practicas artisticas en comunidad, tiene como pilares fundamentales —en el desarrollo tanto individual como grupal— las artes visuales, la musica y la danza. Estas son las herramientas con que se busca la construccion de identidad de los jovenes,comunidad azotada por flagelos sociales, donde la des-escolarizacion los lleva a situaciones problematicas(como el consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, el robo etc.)que terminan por alejarlos de la comunidad.\nEs por lo anterior que el trabajo que se presenta a continuacion tiene como punto de partida el dialogo con la comunidad. Es de maxima importancia la discusion sobre los puntos de vista que tienen de la realidad;la discusion sobre los habitantes de esta (los jovenes y los vecinos del barrio,en su territorio, en sus propios contextos, en sus propios mundos); la discusion sobre los valores, el sentido social y el la manera en que se alcanza el reconocimiento como individuos sociales.",

The obtained statistical data given in the practical part of the work imply that suicidal behaviour is possible no matter the time of the year, month or day. There are just little differences in the number of suicide attempts comparing to the time. Generally it can be stated that the causes of most of the suicidal behaviour come from problems of the society. On the economy level it is low living standard, long-term unemployment and related growing debts. Regarding social problems, we can indicate high divorce rate and related difficulties (children care and breeding after divorce, property composition, emotional deprival ) and homelessness representing especially the loss of material background, social security and relationships to be the causes of sever problems. A considerable cause of suicide attempts is also health state (mainly psychological problems) and adventurous action. The prevention of suicide from the social psychology point of view leans on strengthening of the positive mutual relationship between the group members, so that none of them becomes alone and outside or on the edge of the other members' interest and thus suffers from the feeling of failure, uselessness and emotional deprivation. The main research method used was the statistical data analysis and that is why partial hypotheses formulation was not applied.",

      "abstract": "Deliberativeness denotes a specific quality of political communication that centers around argumentative exchange in a climate of mutual respect and civility. Empirically, deliberativeness is a variable feature of political debate or discussion. From a normative point of view, the standard of deliberativeness can be used to evaluate political communication processes and settings, and to suggest possible ways to improve them. Deliberativeness has been studied in very different communicative settings, including parliamentary debate (Steiner et al. 2004), news media content and television talk shows (Ferree et al. 2002; Wessler &amp; Schultz 2007), online discussion forums (Price et al. 2002), civil society organizations (Ryfe 2002), as well as everyday political talk among citizens (Mutz 2006). When deliberative discussion is not confined to arcane settings, such as decision‐making behind closed doors, or private settings, such as the family, it is also called public deliberation or public discourse (for an overview of the empirical literature, see Delli Carpini et al. 2004; Ryfe 2005).",

      "abstract": "Political socialization (PS) has been defined in various ways in the literature. Among the most frequently encountered definitions is the one that equates PS with mere learning, that is, the state of a person's political knowledge and comprehension. Other definitions focus less on an individual's knowledge inventory than on the developmental sequence by which such knowledge and comprehension are acquired, whereas others focus on the continuity over time of such knowledge and attitudes. However, PS is more and more defined as the gradual development of the individual's own particular and idiosyncratic views of the political world, the process by which a given society's norms and behavior are internalized. This has three main theoretical consequences: primary and secondary socializations are equally important in the socializing process; it follows that not only family and school are central instances of socialization but also many other institutions active in the life spheres of work, affective ties, voluntary work, and political engagements; and the political dimension is in play in all socialization processes and does not correspond to a specific domain of activity or designated institutions.",

This is the question which prompted us to explore these programs, the social work practices and their paradoxes. In spite of the theoretical diversity among all practice analysis programs, the quest for sense seems to be a motive common to all. A number of elements contribute to questioning the sense of social workers’ action : a « professional group » with blurred boundaries, instability in the definition of their missions, instability in the public and social work methods; societal changes linked to the effects of post modernity. Such an unstable combination of facts may produce paradoxes which, according to Barel (1989), are due to systems being all tangled up. These systems, depending on the existential and societal contexts of the actors involved may appear merged and non-paradoxical to them, or separate and paradoxical. Such paradoxes alter the sense of the action. To adapt, actors may resort to «double» strategies that enable to answer contradictory instructions, stemming from different systems. By observing and analyzing a practice analysis program implemented in a medical social centre, we will therefore seek to identify the paradoxes involved, their nature and the strategies developed to regulate them.",

      "abstract": "Attributing equivalence to similar yet slightly differing concepts is a management risk factor in a global economy. Semantic problems may have been overcome through the use of English as the universal language, although the same cannot be said regarding the culturally conditioned interpretation of words and expressions. The confusion between what you meant to say and what is interpreted may create more than bad feelings. It can contribute to management expense and waste. Due to accelerating processes of economic integration, executives involved in planning and logistics and, in the international areas, those who deal with marketing and people management, find themselves faced with culturally different sentiments and reactions with respect to the same expression. Let us examine the word ‘globalization’. This word has acquired a plethora of meanings: (i) the internationalization of the economy (Central Europe, Latin America); (ii) the universalization of the Western or American way of life (Asia); (iii) the global integration of the media and information flows (USA); (iv) the consolidation of supranational economic and commercial events (Latin America); (v) the cultural homogenization, by the imposition of North American values (France, Italy, Great Britain); (vi) the universalization of the economic form of liberalism (Asia, UEA) and (vii) the crystallization of global capitalism (USA).1 In each of these regions and countries, executives work and operate with different concepts and sentiments when dealing with globalization. In what follows, I argue that difficulties arising from misunderstanding the meanings of similar terms are a natural consequence of the globalization process. Culturally-conditioned interpretations are inevitable in the current economic and organizational context. Specifically, I examine the meanings of the concepts chance and fortune and the consequences ensuing from failure to differentiate between them in relationships between Anglo-Saxon and Latin administrative cultures.

En este ambito juega un papel preponderante la cultura preventiva. La reduccion de la delincuencia debe ser atendida por la familia, la escuela y en las instituciones laborales, educando y dirigiendo a los ciudadanos en un medio social armonioso, con una cultura que permita un comportamiento deseado a partir de la difusion, asimilacion y aceptacion de normas, ideas, valores, actitudes, modos de vida, expresados en patrones de conducta estables dentro de la sociedad dada. Los Grupos de Prevencion y Atencion Social deben comprender estas cuestiones: primero, el hecho de que las subculturas en las agrupaciones humanas generan tensiones, polemicas o discrepancias que muchas veces encuentran su expresion en conflictos sociales, agresiones, actos de violencia. Segundo, durante las interacciones sociales en esas agrupaciones aparecen nuevas ideas y creencias con una repercusion social positiva o negativa; por lo que a pesar de ser tratadas las conductas indeseadas que estas generan, si no se acciona sobre la idea o creencia que subyace en la filosofia basica de los miembros, las conductas indeseadas vuelven a repetirse una y otra vez. Tercero, en esas agrupaciones se difunden o imponen elementos normativos, muchos de los cuales pueden ser generadores de conductas delictivas. De manera que si en una agrupacion humana se introducen normas negativas a cumplirse para ser o mantenerse como miembro del mismo, pues inevitablemente se generan conductas indeseadas, que por mucho que sean atendidas estas ultimas, se repiten una y otra vez. Por ejemplo, algun rito, exigencia, regla, que obligatoriamente deban cumplir los miembros del grupo para ser aceptados por los demas.",

Science for decision-making in society and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) have many overlaps in terms of methods but are different in terms of their scope and intention. For both, it is of importance to include the viewpoints of non-scientific stakeholders into the processes of research. While the tools and the challenges of their applications are similar, the scope and intention of RRI and research for society can and should be distinguished.

      "abstract": "Public discourse, understood both as ideas about public action and interactive processes that serve to 'coordinate' the construction of those ideas and to 'communicate' them to the public, has been central to the success (or failure) of the reform projects of social democratic parties. Certain background factors, including countries' policy legacies, problems, preferences, and capacity set the stage for reform while good ideas which are cognitively sound and normatively appropriate as well as relevant, coherent, and consistent contribute to reform success. But institutional context also matters with regard to how ideas are conveyed to whom, with 'simple' polities emphasizing the 'communicative' discourse to the general public and more 'compound' polities the 'coordinative' discourse among policy actors. This is demonstrated with examples from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden. Kurzfassung Offentlicher Diskurs, verstanden sowohl als Ideen uber offentliches Handeln als auch als interaktive Prozesse, die dazu dienen, die Konstruktion dieser Ideen zu koordinieren und diese an die Offentlichkeit zu kommunizieren, hat sich als zentral fur den Erfolg (oder Misserfolg) von Reformprojekten sozialdemokratischer Parteien erwiesen. Gewisse Hintergrundfaktoren, einschlieslich der politischen Vermachtnisse von Landern, ihrer Probleme, Praferenzen und Kapazitaten, schaffen die Voraussetzung fur Reformen, wahrend gute Ideen, kognitiv einwandfrei und normativ sowohl adaquat als auch relevant, koharent und konsistent, zu Reformerfolgen beitragen. Aber der institutionelle Kontext ist ebenso von Bedeutung, im Hinblick darauf, wie Ideen an wen vermittelt werden, wobei einfachen politische Systeme den kommunikativen Diskurs mit der generellen Offentlichkeit betonen und zusammengesetzte politische Systeme den koordinierenden Diskurs unter den politischen Akteuren.

Along with the capacities to develop and transfer technological resources and engage in social negotiations with local communities, support agencies are willing to establish relations of cooperation and support with other groups in the NGO network. From a social policy perspective, difficulties can arise if emphasis on working with the grassroots is set against the objectives of institution building and winning over the formal sector. An extreme version of the idea of self-sufficiency could be seen as telling the poorest sectors of society to give up all hope of gaining access to their patrimony, and to end efforts to negotiate for institutional support for locally generated solutions.",

      "abstract": "We suggest that intentionality attributed to dissenting behavior in intergroup contexts (e.g., exposing one’s country’s secrets) may be conceptualized as benefitting one of four social circles. Two social circles exclude the perceiver: (a) the actor him/herself and (b) the outgroup affected by the behavior; and two circles include the perceiver: (c) the ingroup of both the perceiver and the actor and (d) humanity as the ultimate collective including both ingroup and outgroup. We further suggest that adopting different beneficiary attributions depends on the perceivers’ social identity complexity (Roccas &amp; Brewer, 2002), which refers to an individual’s representation of their multiple social identities on a continuum from highly overlapping to highly differentiated (i.e., simple vs. complex social identity). Perceivers are more likely to attribute dissent behavior to social circles that exclude (rather than include) themselves the simpler their social identity; such exclusive attributions lead to harsher moral judgements, expressed as punitiveness.",

      "title": "Reducing Prejudice and Discrimination",
      "abstract": "Scholars have developed a plethora of approaches to reducing prejudice and discrimination, many of which have been successfully applied in schools, workplaces, and community settings.Research on intergroup contact suggests that contact between members of different groups, particularly when that contact is warm and positive (for example through friendships) reduces negative emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety) and promotes positive emotions (e.g., empathy), results in more positive attitudes toward members of that group.One might expect that, in an increasingly connected world characterized by global mobility and diversity, higher levels of contact would be associated with a significant lessening of prejudice and discrimination.However, critics have pointed out that changes in attitudes at the individual level do not necessarily translate into reduced prejudice and discrimination at a societal level.Moreover, not everyone has the opportunity to engage in meaningful contact with members of other groups, and even when they do, these opportunities are not always capitalized on.One solution to lack of opportunities for contact is to capitalize on \"indirect contact.\"These are interventions based on the principles of contact, but which do not involve a face-to-face encounter.Extended contact, which refers to knowing in-group members who have out-group friends, and vicarious contact, which involves learning about the positive contact experiences of our fellow group members, for example via the media, online intergroup contact, and imagining intergroup contact, have each been shown to promote more positive intergroup attitudes.Another way to reduce prejudice and discrimination is to change the way people categorize social groups.When people perceive members of their own group and another group to belong to the same overarching group-that is, they hold a common in-group identitythere is evidence of reduced intergroup bias.However, when our group membership is important to us, this may constitute a threat to our identity, and lead to a reactive increase in bias in order to reassert the distinctiveness of our group.One solution to this is to encourage a dual identity, whereby an individual holds both the original group membership and a common in-group identity that encompasses both groups simultaneously.Alternatively, given the many and varied group memberships that individuals hold, social categories become less useful as a way of categorizing people.There is also evidence that taking a multicultural approach, where differences are acknowledged, rather than a color-blind approach, where differences are ignored, is less likely to result in prejudice and discrimination.Finally, there is evidence that teaching people about other groups, and about the biases they hold but perhaps are not aware of, can help to reduce prejudice and discrimination.",

      "abstract": "In the social professions, is the qualifications model going to be driven out by a second model, that of the management of skills, as seen in many other sectors of activity? The social professions used to be accepted in their employment sectors in line with the statutory logic of qualifications. However, the recent introduction of a skills management logic privileging individual aptitudes, advantages gained from a variety of professional experiences, and the capacity to conform to the objectives of an employing organization could lead to less regard for original qualifications, and to a decline in any correspondence between a diploma or degree and the individual's position within the repertory of salaried jobs and classifications. One can in fact note an increased disjunction between titles, functions, and status, especially in the newer activity areas (insertion, city/town, policies, mediation, etc.). In contrast, one can still observe a very firmly maintained linkage between the qualification and the job in the traditional sectors (social services, work with the disabled, specialized education, etc.). However, the widening of social interventions beyond the frames of classical action areas, and their extension to areas such as accommodation and home help, along with the progressive modification of organizational models, leads one to wonder whether the social professions will retain their special character, or whether, to the contrary, they will experience a process of differentiation into sub-sectors with reference to alternative operational logics. Will the future of the social professions oscillate between assignation to employment sectors where the qualifications logic reigns (and which could become residual), and entry into new intervention areas where the 'battle of the skills' will be fought? Whatever the outcome, the debate about the professionalism of social workers should surely rise above any such presumed antagonisms.",

      "abstract": "La vida social de ninos y adultos es un recurso importante que puede mitigar o amplificar la repercusion de los malestares cotidianos y/o de los eventos vitales de mayor trascendencia. En general, las personas que perciben que tienen acceso a provisiones de contencion y ayuda de parte de sus redes sociales (i.e. apoyo social percibido, ASP), evaluan los estresores de manera mas benevola y consideran tener mas recursos propios. El ASP puede verse afectado por diversos motivos, uno de ellos es el perfeccionismo, entendido como la tendencia a imponerse estandares elevados de desempeno, autoevaluarse criticamente y autovalorarse de acuerdo a los logros obtenidos. Segun el modelo multidimensional de Paul Hewitt y Gordon Flett (1991), el perfeccionismo contiene un componente intraindividual, el perfeccionismo autorientado (PAO), que representa las exigencias que la persona se asigna, las criticas de las que se hace objeto y los modos en los que reacciona a los logros y/o fracasos; y dos componentes interindividuales: el perfeccionismo socialmente prescrito (PSP) y el orientado a los otros (POO), que son las demandas perfeccion percibidas como proviniendo del medio social, y las exigencias de excelencia a los demas respectivamente. El perfeccionismo tiene una faceta desadaptativa que puede llevar a problemas de salud fisica o mental. Segun el modelo de desconexion social, el desadaptativo llega a esos resultados insanos debido a las consecuencias que tiene en la vida interpersonal, que deterioran los recursos sociales de las personas.\r\nSi bien el impacto del perfeccionismo en el bienestar psicologico infantil es claro, aun son escasos los estudios destinados a detectar sus consecuencias en la vida social de los menores. Considerando esa escasez, este estudio procuro analizar el impacto de las distintas dimensiones del perfeccionismo en la percepcion de apoyo social durante la infancia media, distinguiendo varones y mujeres.",

      "abstract": "Many social interactions require humans to coordinate their behavior across a range of scales. However, aspects of intentional coordination remain puzzling from within several approaches in cognitive science. Sketching a new perspective, we propose that the complex behavioral patterns - or 'unwritten rules' - governing such coordination emerge from an ongoing process of 'virtual bargaining'. Social participants behave on the basis of what they would agree to do if they were explicitly to bargain, provided the agreement that would arise from such discussion is commonly known. Although intuitively simple, this interpretation has implications for understanding a broad spectrum of social, economic, and cultural phenomena (including joint action, team reasoning, communication, and language) that, we argue, depend fundamentally on the virtual bargains themselves.",

      "abstract": "An informal organization usually complements a formal one. Instead of a formal hierarchy there is an informal network. A formal organization usually has certain symbols that represent and signify formality: for example, silver bars on the collar of one's uniform and stripes on the sleeves, in the military. Language is symbolic – “sir,” “ma'am,” “captain” instead of Jim, Jane, or Tom – when addressing someone. Roles differ. In the formal organization, roles are manager, executive, chief, or supervisor. In the informal organization, roles are historian, connector, maven, and humorist. Typically, an informal organization emerges as a counterpoint to the formal system because the latter is too bureaucratic, cumbersome, and inefficient. With the advent of the Internet, however, informal networks are now stand‐alone organizations to counter boredom, loneliness, no social life, and the like. Informal organizations can be beneficial in helping to counter boredom and bureaucracy. They also can have a negative impact on the well‐being of the formal organization by spreading rumors, resisting change, or by encouraging conformity to norms that run counter to effectiveness, for example, deliberately slowing down productivity. The informal organization is beneath the surface, difficult to see, and is represented more by what is not stated than what is said.",

A bilingual individual is someone who has the ability to communicate in two languages alternately. Such an ability or psychological state in the individual has been referred to as bilinguality (Hamers and Blanc 2000). A bilingual society is one in which two languages are used for communication. In a bilingual society, it is possible to have a large number of monolinguals (those who speak only one of the two languages used in that society), provided that there are enough bilinguals to perform the functions requiring bilingual competence in that society. There is therefore a distinction between individual bilingualism and societal bilingualism.",

      "title": "Management of innovative collaboration: Moment of tension and Peer-Mediation Processses",
      "abstract": "Generating new kinds of knowledge is a key concern of knowledge clusters in which cooperative relationships generally outweigh competitive ones. The knowledge in these kinds of clusters has the character of a flow, or to use a simple metaphor, a stream. The idea of a knowledge capital and how to measure it are very difficult to apply in practice. In France, the distinctive feature of knowledge clusters, called ‘poles de competitivite’, is that they are made up of very different entities (businesses, research groups, public or mixed institutions, and so on). The heterogeneous and extended nature of these kinds of organization raises the question of knowledge boundaries and of misunderstandings among members belonging to different entities. In this context, different actors who speak the same mother tongue, French for instance, do not share the same language. To understand one another it is not enough to speak the same tongue. This observation is quite common, however, the importance of its consequences has not been much taken into account. Indeed, in day-to-day work, speakers express themselves in their usual way, in conformity with the codes of the community to which they belong. The presence of several communities brings with it problems of misunderstanding. These arise sporadically, then retreat into the background, and so remain dormant. We demonstrate this by studying the case of a collaborative project named NP that we followed for 2 years, taking part in meetings of the consortium, and transcribing verbatim discussions arising at moments of obvious tension which we were able to observe through our involvement in the project. More particularly we analyze a moment of tension emerging during a consortium meeting between communities of physicists and chemists. Reading this moment in the light of Harry Collins’ theoretical framework we will show that the collective tacit knowledge of each community gives rise to different interpretations of the same subject. These are strongly linked to the usual methods and practices within each community or profession. Following Yrjo Engestrom, we show that such moments of tension reveal the dynamics of an activity system and the obstacles to mutual understanding; they also provide a way for actors to transcend the language boundaries. Thus, contradictions and tensions by no means impair the project: on the contrary they should be considered as an opportunity to make progress, generate new knowledge and innovate. The Peer-Mediation Process, by transcending rather than simply overcoming those tensions, offers new perspectives: it becomes a constituent part of knowledge management.",

At the micro level, this most often involves bringing services to and improving the quality of life of people who are vulnerable and oppressed. However, direct practitioners must also be able to assess different systems levels beyond the individual and determine the appropriate intervention and its appropriate level (micro, meso, and macro), and to know when and how to implement various theories.

      "abstract": "Different times call for different measures.\"By paraphrasing an old aphorism, we outline an important observation about motivation in social relations.What motivates someone depends on the individual's social context and self-perception.In uncertain times, when the perception of external threats and self-uncertainty are predominant, people tend to seek clarity, coherence, and reduced interaction with out-group members, which could be followed, for example, by stronger in-group favoritism and extreme progroup actions (Hogg, 2009;Hogg, Kruglanski, & Bos, 2013).However, much research has shown that in more fortunate times, when one feels one's identity is integrated and one's self-concept is coherent and consistent, propensity for self-expansion could take precedence (Dys-Steenbergen, Wright, & Aron, 2015;Wright, Aron, & Tropp, 2002).People are motivated in such circumstances to interact with others, more or less known to them, in order to develop new social identities and enhance their self-complexity.The sources of selfexpansion could be new activities, strong intimate relations with close others, or inclusion of other members of one's social group in the self-concept (Aron & Aron, 1986; 1996a; 1996b;Aron, Aron, & Norman, 2001).According to self-expansion model people are fundamentally motivated to improve and grow the self by developing new perspectives, new identities, enhancing capabilities, and gaining resources (Aron & Aron, 1986; 1996a;Aron, Aron, & Norman, 2001).In a close relationship each person expands his or her sense of self through the acquisition of new common beliefs, attitudes, feelings, and behaviors from people belonging to the person's social circle.Thus incorporating others in self-",

La investigación se centra en los puntos del espectro social que, junto con otros de naturaleza lingüística, estimulan todavía la elección de la perífrasis prepositiva (deber de), en un marco general mucho más favorable a la variante no prepositiva (deber) en todo el mundo hispánico. Desde el punto de vista sociolectal, el estudio revela una notable complejidad, ya que en la comunidad se dan cita normas sociolingüísticas aparentemente contradictorias, pero que de consuno actúan en una misma dirección, preservando todavía el empleo de dicha variante. Factores como el sexo, la edad y el nivel de instrucción son seleccionados como significativos por el aparato estadístico multivariante, pero su alcance difiere entre unos sectores sociales y otros. Esta heterogeneidad sociolectal podría explicarse por el hecho de que, frente a otros fenómenos de variación sintáctica con mayor saliencia normativa, como el dequeísmo, el analizado en estas páginas se halla sometido a reglas preceptivas cuyo alcance—la oposición modal epistémico-deóntica—es más complejo, y en el fondo, desconocido por la mayoría.",

Although increasingly indicated in the cast of well-being and health outcome predictors, the roles of social support and the self-concept have been pursued relatively independent of one another. The objective here is to explore mechanisms that serve a social cognitive basis for “transactions” (cf. Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) between the two as well as the relevance of these transactional dynamics for coping and striving efforts and for personal health outcomes. An underlying premise is that the prevailing emphasis on cognitive features of the self-concept predisposes preventive and remedial interventions toward intrapsychic solutions, and that a better understanding of the social interface may argue for a more contextual approach.",

Insiders have access to a network of social transactions that enable them to tap into resources and information that lead to employment, housing, and other opportunities for upward mobility. These processes are often informal, and sometimes exclusive. The social networks that Outsiders have pertain largely to the acquisition of a meal or a night's shelter. They do not have access to the better-endowed social networks of Insiders, and are therefore not privy to the informational and resources exchange that takes place therein. This translates into fewer job interviews, fewer housing applications, etc. Finally, this means that when an Outsider experiences a Stressor (i.e., the flu, eviction, unemployment), it can take on crisis proportions leading ultimately to homelessness. However dim the prospects of Outsiders are, there are specific corrective processes, which can be implemented.",

Employees are asked to share knowledge and develop new ideas on internal social media (Vuori and Okkonen, 2012) and to act as brand ambassadors on external social media, since they can promote the brand in a trustworthy and reliable way (Snyder and Honig, 2016; Pekkala and Luoma-aho, 2017). The enactment of active communication roles springs out of organizational identification and organizational citizen behavior (Morrison, 1994). However, as the importance of employees as communicators increases, organizations encourage employees to enact these active communication roles. In this respect, employees are not only required to perform their job in a satisfactory manner, they also have to play a number of communication roles. These elevated role expectations complicate organizational communication for employees. They can experience stress since they have to act out so many different roles or they can experience role conflict or ambiguity. No comprehensive framework has so far defined or described the many communication roles employees are expected to play. An extensive literature review was conducted to identify and understand the many employee communication role in organizational, strategic and corporate communication. Based on the review a typology of eight employee communication roles was developed to clarify the roles and discuss the consequences for employees and organizational communication.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: The scholarly discourse on social norms in the tradition of Thomas Schelling (1960) often makes a sharp distinction between social norms and social conventions. In attempting to apply that distinction to actual practices and to teach it to practitioners and students I encountered frequent difficulties and confusions, and finally concluded that it is untenable. I recommend a return to some version of Ullman-Margalit’s (1977) distinction between social norms of cooperation and social norms of coordination. Social norms, I say, are distinguished by beliefs in a relevant group that the rule is typical among them and approved of among them. I describe four ways that social norms of coordination, including conventions of social meaning, are influenced by social approval and disapproval. I contend that the effort by Southwood and Eriksson (2011) to show that social conventions and social norms are essentially different breaks down because their conception of social norms is overly moralized. I present a more social conception of social norms that does without the regnant distinction between “social norm” and “social convention” and instead allows for social norms of cooperation, social norms of coordination, and other kinds of social norms.",

For some species, including humans, social learning leads to the diffusion and maintenance of behaviours over many generations: the process of cultural transmission [3]. It is hypothesised that species differences in cultural complexity are driven by differences in evolved social learning mechanisms and the population dynamics of different cultural systems [4, 5]. The diffusion of innovations is an integral part of this cultural process and whilst it is understood that biases in social learning will impact the diffusion of innovation [6, 7], it is unclear how the diffusion of innovations is related to the efficacy of any particular social learning mechanism or strategy. Here we study innovation diffusion as an emergent process of adaptive social learning in an evolutionary context.",

      "abstract": "Small communities require the services of professionals such as doctors and teachers, but most professionals are trained in metropolitan areas. Urban-trained professionals are seldom prepared for the social and cultural differences that confront them when they move to rural communities. Such newcomers frequently experience culture shock--the stress brought on by unfamiliarity with a new social or cultural context and the inability to predict other people's reactions in the new context. Several sociological models relevant to culture shock are reviewed. These include Tonnies' concept of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft relationships; Durkheim's idea of mechanical versus organic solidarity; and Dillman's notion that community relations are influenced by community size, stability, homogeneity, and overlapping institutional memberships. These latter variables influence many rural-urban differences in social dynamics, including differences in enactment of social norms, in initiating roles, and in the nature of primary relationships and mutual obligations. Professionals relocating to a small isolated community need to consider the implications of living in a Gemeinschaft context. Ten strategies are listed that will help any person through the stages of culture shock, followed by additional suggestions related to professional isolation, professional status, and self-concept.

In the paper, while using theories of business management, the emphasis will be on the specifics of the arts and culture management engineering. In the focus of business management, the profit-product is secondary, as one company today can produce shoes and tomorrow mobile phones. In the world of culture, this is the diametrically opposite - in the focus of management is the work (or certain service), and profit is just a secondary goal (linked to self-sustainability, survival of the organization). Also, in the business world, the main task is to \"kill\" competition, while in the world of cultural management, competition is generally accepted and even supported (by borrowing personnel, technical or information resources). Loyalty to the corporation is ensured by contracts in the business world (preventing an employee from engaging in the same job in a competitive company a few years after the termination of employment), while in the management of culture, commitment is built up by moral values or, if such a type of loyalty (self-esteem and internal reputation) does not get, the organization is usually dissolved. There are also many other differences between management in the world of business and in the world of culture, and these differences become clear and not explicitly exposed.(Tomasevic, Tomic 2015, page 5).",

      "abstract": "Abstract In a severe epidemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing can be a vital tool to stop the spread of the disease and save lives. However, social distancing may induce profound negative social/economic impacts as well. How to optimize social distancing is a serious social, political, as well as public health issue yet to be resolved. This work investigates social distancing with a focus on how every individual reacts to an epidemic, what role he/she plays in social distancing, and how every individual’s decision contributes to the action of the population and vice versa. Social distancing is thus modeled as a population game, where every individual makes decision on how to participate in a set of social activities, some with higher frequencies while others lower or completely avoided, to minimize his/her social contacts with least possible social/economic costs. An optimal distancing strategy is then obtained when the game reaches an equilibrium. The game is simulated with various realistic restraints including (i) when the population is distributed over a social network, and the decision of each individual is made through the interactions with his/her social neighbors; (ii) when the individuals in different social groups such as children vs. adults or the vaccinated vs. unprotected have different distancing preferences; (iii) when leadership plays a role in decision making, with a few leaders making decisions while the rest of the population just follow. The simulation results show how the distancing game is played out in each of these scenarios, reveal the conflicting yet cooperative nature of social distancing, and shed lights on a self-organizing, bottom-up perspective of distancing practices.",

It refers to a person's or group's borrowing ways of thinking (ideas) and ways of doing things (procedures) from other cultures to solve specific problems. Pragmatic acculturation is usually but not exclusively found in ethnically plural societies and it is conceptually different from acculturation or assimilation, usually defined as “the process by which an outsider, immigrant, or subordinate group becomes indistinguishably integrated into the dominant host society” (Marshall, 1996: 20). In contrast to acculturation, the notion of “culture borrowing” in pragmatic acculturation is more than just a “movement of things among societies”; it encompasses patterns of behavior and attitudes. The concept of pragmatic acculturation in comparative sociological research contributes to an effective understanding of the permeability of cultural boundaries; of the effect of permeability on various aspects of social life; of the permanent or temporary transformation in belief systems; and of the way cultural beliefs and norms influence accounts of social life processes and events such as work productivity, governance styles, or disease incidence and prevalence across communities and countries (Quah, 2003, 2007).",

      "abstract": "About 200 children, age 5–11, from three different regions in Southern England were interviewed about their understanding of social events: school, store, money, payment, the community and government, some specific jobs, and acquisition of a role. Seven characteristics of thinking about the 'impersonal' social world were proposed and illustrated by interrelated evidence. To most 5- to 6-year old children the world 'out there' appeared: (1) undifferentiated (minimal role and individual differences); (2) personalized (voluntaristic); (3) everything occurs according to known rules (no contingencies); (4) conflict-free (happy); (5) with easy access to money; (6) ego-typical (own experience is the norm), and (7) focused on external aspects. Four substages of social understanding were proposed as showing a developmental progression: (1) arbitrary-personalized with imaginative elaborations; (2) primitive functional differentiation; (3) part systems of social functions, and (4) coherent global system. While substage 4 eliminates major 'childish' discrepancies due to a global conceptual framework – analogous to Piaget's concrete operations – it does not indicate any deep understanding of society's structure which is probably reserved for adolescents and adults with specialized interests and the capacity for formal operations. Implications of these findings for educational and social planning were discussed.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new model to explain the acceptance/rejection of agents (co-workers) and various social groups (people with mental disorders or disabilities, the elderly, the unemployed/poor, ethnic minorities) in a given social system: the social utility-based acceptance/rejection (SUBAR) Model. Based on a social utility approach, it is proposed that human social cognition evaluates and reacts to agents/groups in a social system on the basis of the perceived strengths and significant contributions they bring to the system (upward forces; e.g., skills, resources, willingness) and the perceived weaknesses that may harm the system (downward forces; e.g., use of social benefits, dependence). While the perception of upward forces for the system (i.e., vital forces) is accompanied by acceptance (positive attitudes and behaviors), the perception of downward forces (i.e., burdens on the system) promotes rejection (negative attitudes and behaviors). The combination of the two indicators predicts that low vital forces/high burden targets will be the most rejected and high vital forces/low burden targets will be the most accepted. The high burden/high vital forces and low vital forces/low burden targets should be evaluated at an intermediate level between the other two. This naive calculation of the forces exerted by agents/groups in a social system is moderated by various variables (scarcity of economic resources, values) and responds to a functional attempt to regulate individual and collective interests, themselves dependent on the efficiency of given systems. Finally, the relationship of the SUBAR model to other relevant theories will also be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Sexueller Missbrauch kann zu massiven, zum Teil lebenslangen Belastungen führen und ist ein schwerwiegendes (Gesundheits-)Problem auf individueller, familialer und gesellschaftlicher Ebene. Deshalb sind Präventionsmaßnahmen auf verschiedenen Ebenen unerlässlich. Um sexuellen Missbrauch von Minderjährigen nachhaltig reduzieren zu können, müssen neben Kindern und Jugendlichen auch Erwachsene in Präventionsbemühungen miteinbezogen werden. Ferner gilt es, gesellschaftliche Normen, Strukturen und Wertvorstellungen sowie die jeweilige Gesetzgebung so zu beeinflussen, dass Täter und deren Verhalten nicht mehr geschützt werden. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten wurden zahlreiche Programme für unterschiedliche Zielgruppen entwickelt. Viele dieser Programme haben sich teilweise als wirksam erwiesen. Dennoch herrscht kein Konsens darüber, was wissenschaftlich als wirksam angesehen werden kann. Dies liegt zum einen an den Unstimmigkeiten in den Definitionen, zum anderen daran, dass in einem gewissen politischen Aktionismus die Evaluierung von Präventionsmaßnahmen nur wenig beachtet wurde.",

      "title": "Los modelos en trabajo social: intervención con personas y familias",
      "abstract": "Desde su aparicion a principios de siglo, la intervencion profesional del Trabajo Social ha ido desarrollando y aplicando un conjunto de modelos para afrontar los problemas sociales en su dimension individual-familiar o .en su dimension colectiva. Mas que de. una agria controversia de escuelas, se trata de planteamientos sincreticos, inclusores; cada nuevo enfoque se hace eco de los anteriores -y coetaneos-, y aunque han ido variando las teorias de referencia o se han ido ideando nuevas estrategias de intervencion, permanecen maneras de ver y de actuar, forjadoras de la identidad del campo de la intervencion social. Cierto es que el enfasis se ha ido desplazando de lo intrapersonal a lo interpersonal y socio-institucional; pero tambien esto hay que matizarlo: desde el inicio, y por muy terapeutico que fuese un cierto trabajo social, siempre se comprendio el caracter del problema a abordar. De todos modos, parece existir, a escala internacional, una tendencia general a distanciarse de los modelos basados en la teoria psicoanalitica para centrarse en otros modelos que integran una pluralidad de sistemas teoricos y de experiencias practicas. Los primeros modelos ponen el acento en la terapia de la persona y la solucion de problemas: estan orientados hacia la accion preventiva por medio de la intervencion en momentos de crisis, hacia problemas bien delimitados a traves de la modificacion de conducta y el corto plazo planificado centrado en la tarea. En este ultimo caso, la caracteristica sobresaliente consiste en la adopcion del marco de referencia del cliente/usuario para determinar el problema y los objetivos. Un marco de referencia nuevo, que utiliza la teoria de sistemas y las teorias de la comunicacion, permite abordar, en otra dimension, la terapia de pareja y de familia; permite asimismo aproximarse al Trabajo Social de un modo distinto, matizar las nociones de causalidad y de responsabilidad, al fijar la atencion sobre el proceso, sobre el equilibrio del sistema y el mantenimiento de su estabilidad. El enfoque de socializacion demuestra finalmente la necesidad de replantear la practica del Trabajo Social ante la emergencia de nuevos problemas sociales en un mundo cambiante. La pluralidad de modelos tan didacticamente expuestos aqui -los casos practicos son frecuentes en el texto- nos da un panorama bastante amplio de la dimension individual-familiar del Trabajo Social. Despliega ante los profesionales de lo social un amplio abanico de funciones y roles: informante, defensor, mediador, orientador o educador; proporcionar modelos de conducta; intervenir en el sistema familiar; mostrar nuevas formas de actuacion, etcetera. Este libro, de gran utilidad como manual orientador en la formacion inicial, supone a su vez un acicate para profundizar en la autonomia y el desarrollo de la profesion del Trabajo Social en los Servicios Sociales Personales y en otros sistemas del bienestar, en nuestro pais, distanciandola de planteamientos puramente gestores, asistenciales y subalternos, en el fondo desprofesionalizadores.",

      "title": "Du handicap aux pratiques sportives: enjeux et perspectives",
      "abstract": "We cannot find a unique definition of the concept of handicap in Europe. Even within individual countries, many approaches are generally observed according to now this term is applied. Handicap is a generic concept which can comprise heterogeneous groups of people. Any international comparison reveals itself to be an arduous task. In fact the groups of people concerned are not the same everywhere and practices vary according to these specific cultural, social and economic backgrounds. Public policies depend on the different representations of the notion of handicap and are influenced by both disabled people themselves as well as by policy makers as well. For example in France from the early 1960s the word ”handicap” was progressively replaced by other nouns such as “infirme” (disabled) or “inadapte” (usted, malad). The shift in meaning of the word “handicape” seems to be related to the distressing ordeals experienced by some, which have led to somatic and mental weaknesses and to the idea that ways can be found to compensate for handicaps and allowing ways to live as a able-bodied person. Beyond the widely spread social norms and behaviour, the handicapped person faces constraining representations almost stereotypical which a lead to the sense of enclosure. Beeing born triggers or handicapped generates a whole set of psychic disorders provoking an inner and collective moral suffering. The human body can be considered as the prevailing pillar of identity for both handicapped and valid people. A two-fold psychological mechanism seems to be at the root of the handicapped person’s self-acceptance and his/her relationships to others and to social groups.",

      "title": "Sport for Social Cohesion: Transferring From the Pitch to the Community?",
      "abstract": "European sport policies and programmes have increasingly focused on promoting social cohesion. Often presented as a multi-dimensional concept, social cohesion is considered the ‘glue’ that holds societies together and is seen as essential to addressing common challenges. However, the term remains convoluted, and it is not always clear how programmes conceptualise or support social cohesion. Thus, this paper explores how three European sport programmes conceptualise and foster social cohesion. Findings are generated from a thematic analysis of interviews, group discussions, observations and documents. The themes developed show how organisations adopt an individual-centred view of social cohesion, focusing mainly on social relations, tolerance and mutual help. In turn, this translates to an individual-focused practice of social cohesion, emphasising personal skills, behaviours, and social relations, with the transfer of social cohesion to the broader community left mostly in the hands of participants. Due to a number of systemic barriers, programmes struggle to implement more holistic and structural approaches. As such, if we want to facilitate a move towards more structural or interventionist approaches, we as researchers must play an active role in questioning, challenging, and reshaping the systems that underpin sport-based social interventions.",

      "abstract": "Introduction ... we ignore the local narratives and meanings that inform the participants at the peril of misunderstanding the nature and extent of violence. (Jon Abbink, 2001:123) Many conflicts are embedded in intolerance and prejudices that are culturally constructed. Some have also remained intractable on account of lack of awareness and intercultural communication. People, most times, do not only see things from their own perspectives, but usually expect cultural others to use same lens to cognise and interpret the social environment. Divergent views that emanate from an alternative perception, therefore, necessarily create misunderstanding, which may afterward result in tension, and sometimes, violent conflict. Since human perceptions, values, and organisation of meanings are product of socialisation experience, which usually is context specific, it reasonably follows that cultures around the world may develop different explanation for a singular phenomenon. In other words, intercultural conflicts occur in the contexts of differences and underscore the way different societies perceive social reality (Kimmel, 2006; Avruch, 2005; Avruch and Black, 1991). Quite often, when the relevance of culture to conflict and conflict management is acknowledged in peace and conflict studies, it is usually in relation to the impacts, which communication and perception bear on negotiations and mediation processes (Fisher 1980; Weiss 1994; Bercovitch and Elgstrom 2001). Stephen Weiss, for instance, reckons negotiation as duly affected by the actors' basic conception of negotiation, their orientation toward time, their willingness to take risks, their protocol, and their decision-making style (Weiss 1994).",

      "abstract": "Linguistic norms emerge in human communities because people imitate each other. A shared linguistic system provides people with the benefits of shared knowledge and coordinated planning. Once norms are in place, why would they ever change? This question, echoing broad questions in the theory of social dynamics, has particular force in relation to language. By definition, an innovator is in the minority when the innovation first occurs. In some areas of social dynamics, important minorities can strongly influence the majority through their power, fame, or use of broadcast media. But most linguistic changes are grassroots developments that originate with ordinary people. Here, we develop a novel model of communicative behavior in communities, and identify a mechanism for arbitrary innovations by ordinary people to have a good chance of being widely adopted. To imitate each other, people must form a mental representation of what other people do. Each time they speak, they must also decide which form to produce themselves. We introduce a new decision function that enables us to smoothly explore the space between two types of behavior: probability matching (matching the probabilities of incoming experience) and regularization (producing some forms disproportionately often). Using Monte Carlo methods, we explore the interactions amongst the degree of regularization, the distribution of biases in a network, and the network position of the innovator. We identify two regimes for the widespread adoption of arbritrary innovations, viewed as informational cascades in the network. With moderate regularization of experienced input, average people (not well-connected people) are the most likely source of successful innovations. Our results shed light on a major outstanding puzzle in the theory of language change. The framework also holds promise for understanding the dynamics of other social norms.",

Apart from the many symbols of unity and of function in modern social organisms, ceremonies and ritualistic practices are common (Arnold 1937). There are rites of passage , as initiation of apprentices into occupational groups, rites of intensification , as conventions, regular meetings and conferences, and rites of sanctification , as ‘proper channels’, formalized reporting systems and the like, not just utilitarian but reinforcing common purpose and solidarity. Such rituals have an overtly rational basis in that they are apprehended as, or believed to be necessary or ancillary to the purposes of groups, as in Sir Julian Huxley’s ( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) (seep. 267). However, there are other rituals more akin to those seen in the higher vertebrates in not being rational, the word ‘rational’ implying a process of brain functioning, thought or mind, limited to man. The higher vertebrates show awareness (perception) and consciousness (perception of causality) but not, as distinct from man, mind (conception) which is a process stemming from the development of verbal communication. These nonrational rituals are ‘emotive’, the result of ritualization of behaviour at a ‘subconscious’ level, just as routine, or habit can be a Pavlovian reflex.",

      "abstract": "Recibido el 10 de noviembre 2011 Aprobado el 22 de marzo de 2012 Resumen: Uno de los recursos mas utilizados para llevar a la practicas politicas de inclusion educativa son los programas Entrenamiento en Habilidades Sociales, ya sea en forma de actividades especificas en la programacion del aula con un tiempo y espacio propio (Educacion para la Ciudadania, Etica, Educacion en Valores, Tutoria Grupal…), o como un elemento transversal a trabajar en los distintos contenidos a la hora de establecer los objetivos a conseguir por un equipo educativo en los distintos ambitos de la educacion formal como no formal. Los programas de intervencion de Habilidades Sociales basados en los Derechos Asertivos de Smith (1975) generan multitud de dinamicas aplicadas, pero presentan una fundamentacion teorica practicamente nula en la que se entremezclan elementos muy diversos sin una articulacion coherente (derechos del consumidor, imposicion de objetivos individualistas, racionalizacion de beneficios…) (CABALLO, 1991) y ( ROCA, 2005). Esta carencia acaba fomentando un aprendizaje opuesto al que se pretende: lejos de mejorar las habilidades de relacion con los demas como deber y un fin en si mismo, objetivo primordial en una educacion inclusiva, se aprende a tratar a los demas como un medio para conseguir los objetivos individuales sean cuales sean. Comportamiento este muy habilidoso, pero ciertamente antisocial. Es decir, el mensaje, la justificacion que se transmite por la que la alternativa asertiva es preferible a la agresiva o a la pasiva es que supuestamente consigue mejor los objetivos “es mas util”, no porque se interiorice que es la alternativa que preserva mejor los derechos de los demas y propios. Esta situacion puede producirse si entendemos los programas de Habilidades Sociales como una tecnica (un como hacer), una herramienta lista y preparada para trabajar la competencia social, sin reflexionar primero sobre sus fundamentos, objetivos y horizontes (un por que hacer).",

      "title": "Public Relations and the Strategic Use of Transparency: Consistency, Hypocrisy, and Corporate Change",
      "abstract": "In spite of considerable developments over the past century, the field of public \nrelations continues to struggle with the issue of its proper position in the world. \nWhat is its role in the pursuit of a good or “full functioning” society? How can \npublic relations add value to a global community? What are, in other words, its \npoints of legitimacy in a world of growing complexity and interdependency (e.g., \nHeath, 2006)? These are complicated issues and public relations should not be \nblamed for failing to resolve them fully. The ongoing questioning, which has \nbecome part of the field’s self-reflective institutionalization, holds some important \nmerits in itself (cf. Holmstrom, 2005). While the discipline continues to have a \nwidely acknowledged image problem (Callison, 2001; Edwards, 2006; Hutton, \n1999; Newsom, Ramsey, & Carrell, 1993), the quest for an ethical public relations \nparadigm has been shaping the field for several decades (Grunig & Hunt, 1984; \nGrunig, 1993, 2000; see also Bowen, 2005; David, 2004; Edgett, 2002; Kent & \nTaylor, 2002; Woodward, 2000) to the effect that it is now considered central to \nthe field’s self-understanding (Seib & Fitzpatrick, 1995; Starck & Kruckeberg, \n2003). Consequently, public relations has the potential to become a key driver \ntowards a better society. The aim of this chapter is to add new dimensions to our \nunderstanding of that challenge and how it can be met in a society focused on \nincreased information about organizations and their activities.",

      "title": "Spatial dialectics and social exclusion: young people not in education, employment or training",
      "abstract": "The language of exclusion is dense with spatial reference and metaphor. Social exclusion is often defined in terms of multiple deprivations affecting particular neighbourhoods and localities, and the excluded are discursively positioned as 'outside' or 'disconnected from' an included majority. For young people outside education in 21st-century England, these spatialities permeate their lives and profoundly affect their experiences. Although the origins of the concept of social exclusion in European Social and Christian Democratic traditions has entailed some emphasis on social integration and limited forms of redistribution, in neo-liberal policy discourse the excluded are often constructed as a deficient 'underclass', lacking employability and dependent on welfare (Levitas, 2005). Such discourses are spatially referenced, with certain practices and cultures ascribed to particular locations - so that the relationship between place and underclass is reified and politically exploited. However, as Wacquant (1999) has argued, the association between 'underclass' behaviours and place is part of a class-based polarisation of space arising from de-industrialisation, macro-economic policies and increasing inequality (see also Simmons and Thompson, 2011). Consequently, researchers working with young people deemed to be 'at risk' of social exclusion must seek to uncover the social, material and discursive relations embedded in the spaces participants inhabit. \r\n\r\nThis paper reports on the first eighteen months of a three-year longitudinal ethnographic study of young people in a post-industrial urban area of northern England who have been officially classified as NEET (not in education, employment or training). Drawing on structuration theory (Giddens, 1984) and Lefebvre's (1991) dialectical triad of perceived, conceived and lived space, the paper analyses how young people are constrained and enabled by spatial structures relating to family, work, learning and welfare. \r\n\r\nThe central research questions of the paper are:\r\n•\tHow do social, material and discursive relations enter into the construction of places and spaces for NEET young people - including official spaces (such as learning sites, guidance centres, welfare benefit offices) and informal spaces, both private and public? [Conceived space]\r\n•\tHow do young people encounter these places and spaces? [Perceived space]\r\n•\tHow do young people draw on their knowledge of social space to understand, use and contest spatial structures? [Lived space] \r\n•\tHow are spatialities implicated in reproducing or interrupting marginalisation? \r\n\r\nWe conceptualise structure as existing in and through the knowledge and practices of historically and spatially situated agents and institutions; drawing on our ethnographic data, we investigate how young people comprehend, use and encounter the places and spaces they inhabit, and the role of spatialities in reproducing or interrupting marginalisation. Following Lefebvre (1991), we interpret lived space as the dialectical outcome of perceived and conceived space - the co-extensive spaces of, respectively, material events and abstractly conceptualised spatial relations. Embodying both of these spaces whilst being ir¬reducible to them, lived space is the arena of Lefebvre's connaissance – “less formal or more local forms of knowledge” (Elden, 2004: 190) and Giddens' (1984) practical consciousness. Within this conceptual framework, we trace how young people use their knowledge to negotiate and contest their spaces. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY \r\nThe ethnography explores the experiences of 23 young people as they move in and out of various forms of education, training, employment or other spheres. So far over 150 hours of participant observation has been conducted in young people’s homes, schools, colleges, training providers, benefit offices, charity events, parental homes, work placements, car journeys, and cafes. Field notes detail young people’s use of space and time; behaviour as learners; and relations with tutors, careers advisors, benefit office staff, social workers, friends and family. Conversations and 47 semi-structured interviews with participating young people, 'significant others' and practitioners also contribute to the corpus of data, alongside photographs (some taken by young people and others by the ethnographer) and documentary evidence. Life-course maps (Webster et al. 2004) are used in discussion with young people to record significant events, both past and present. Data is analysed using Carspecken's (1996) five-stage critical ethnography, which allows us to connect local practices, understandings and relations with broader social structures and distributions of power. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nLocal spaces resonate with the global, and discourses of individualisation, neo-liberalism and globalisation give specific form to the realisation of the spaces experienced by 'at risk' young people. Recognising the significance of a 'spatial turn' in educational theory (Gulson and Symes, 2007; Raffo, 2011), we expect that our conceptual framework will contribute to understanding how young people, as knowledgeable agents, participate in social practices which both structure, and are structured by, their spaces. Our research so far suggests that official spaces sometimes negate and sometimes empower young people’s agency, and the interplay of structure and agency within formal and informal places of being shapes young people’s experiences of inclusion and exclusion. We aim to further uncover how social relations are reproduced or contested in certain discourses within certain spaces, which may interact in inclusionary and exclusionary ways. The transferability of our findings to other European and international urban contexts will also be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Democratic societies have given to themselves many means of depicting in a realistic manner the state of their public opinion about recurrent societal issues and current affairs. Ethnographic inquiries - the interviews, surveys and quantitative studies are tools and techniques that allow, either separately or in combination and for each issue investigated, a broad picture to be painted, a picture of the opposing positions and of the balance of power between them. These inquiries, be they qualitative or quantitative, share the assumption that members of a community have individual opinions on issues of general interest, which they share with others. Their assimilation to particular classification standards transforms them into social objects that both opinion inquiries and polls and the methodologies of social sciences have to elaborate so as to deliver results significant on the scale of the community concerned. The complex and varied operations that extend from the definition of an issue to data collection and analysis are not themselves accessible in the published results. In other words, we cannot expect going from the final research results back to the operations through which the results have been produced. In other words, the local and temporal organisation of the analytic process vanishes in its final object.",

It is no easy task, however, to specify how effects occur or how particular environmental features are linked to particular qualities of people or particular developmental outcomes. The task is difficult enough when we limit descriptions of environmental contacts to face-to-face interactions. It becomes even more difficult when we begin to heed Bronfenbrenner's (1979) call to pay attention to such settings as school, workplace, or neighborhood and at the same time to treat these in a more dynamic fashion than by referring to the usual “social address labels” of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or culture.",

      "abstract": "espanolLos medios de comunicacion de masas tradicionales estan cada vez mas sometidos a un analisis riguroso de sus producciones linguisticas y a un seguimiento continuo de las representaciones que hacen del Otro (Alarcon 2004). Por ello, observamos que, de cierta descalificacion directa y ordinaria a principios de los anos noventa (El-MadkouriMaataoui 2009), se ha pasado a una serie de estrategias comunicativas con construcciones linguisticas sutiles cuyo decir y querer decir no apuntan el mismo objetivo y que constituyen lo que se ha convenido en llamar microracismos. De hecho, la presion academica y social de las ultimas decadas, junto con una conciencia intelectual mas informada, ademas de la presencia activa de este Otro entre Nosotros, han participado igualmente en reducir las manifestaciones del macroracismo, produciendo, en cambio, manifestaciones microdiscursivas que eluden la regulacion y el rechazo social. Sin embargo, existe otra manifestacion discursiva a la cual se ha prestado menos atencion: la metaforizacion del otro y su conversion en una caricatura de si mismo. En la presente investigacion nos centramos precisamente en el analisis y descripcion de la metaforizacion y caricaturizacion del Otro a traves del discurso que se reproduce de el. EnglishTraditional mass media are increasingly subjected to a rigorous analysis of their linguistic productions and to a continuous monitoring of the representations they make of the Other (Alarcon 2004). For this reason, we observe that, from a certain direct and ordinary disqualification in the early nineties (El-Madkouri Maataoui 2009), a series of communication strategies has been adopted with subtle linguistic constructions: what they say and what they want to say have different objectives and they constitutewhat has been called microracisms. In fact, the academic and social pressure during the last decades, along with a more informed intellectual conscience, in addition to the active presence of this Other among us, have also caused the reduction of macroracism, producing, instead, microdiscursive manifestations that elude regulation and social rejection. However, there is another discursive manifestation to which less attention has been paid: the metaphorization of the other and its conversion into a caricature of himself. In the present investigation we focus precisely on the analysis and description of the metaphorization and caricature of the Other through the reproduced discourse.",

Differences are even greater and more noticeable in cases of organizations from other environments, neighbouring countries or even from other continents.

      "abstract": "English abstract: Age integration - a term used in social gerontology in at least two senses. In a narrow perspective - adopted mainly in English-language literature - age integration refers to such a structure of social roles in various institutions that allows for differences, but they do not depend strictly on the age structure, i.e. whether someone is a middle-aged adult or in an older age. This is particularly about educational, economic, political, religious and leisure institutions in which people from different age groups and generations play different roles and occupy different positions. Age integration is based on the assumption that access to the institution, the possibility of exiting it and access to products (called outputs); services implemented in reality and benefits and outcomes paid out; the effects of implemented services and services, eg reduction of poverty, improvement of health, activities of these institutions is equal for all regardless of age. Polish abstract: Integracja wiekowa - termin stosowany w gerontologii spolecznej w przynajmniej dwoch znaczeniach. W ujeciu wąskim - przyjetym glownie w literaturze anglojezycznej - integracja wiekowa odnosi sie do takiej struktury rol spolecznych w roznorodnych instytucjach, ktora umozliwia istnienie roznic, ale nie są one zalezne ściśle od struktury wieku, tj. tego czy ktoś jest osobą mlodą, w wieku środkowym, czy tez w wieku starszym (Phillips i wspolprac., 2010). Chodzi tutaj w szczegolności o instytucje edukacyjne, ekonomiczne, polityczne, religijne i czasu wolnego w ktorych osoby z odmiennych grup wieku i generacji odgrywają rozmaite role i zajmują rozne pozycje. Integracja wiekowa opiera sie na zalozeniu, ze dostep do instytucji, mozliwości wyjścia z niej i dostep do produktow (ang. outputs); zrealizowanych w rzeczywistości uslug i wyplaconych świadczen oraz rezultatow (ang. outcomes); efektow zrealizowanych uslug i świadczen np. zmniejszenie ubostwa, poprawa stanu zdrowia, dzialalności tych instytucji jest rowny dla wszystkich bez wzgledu na wiek.",

La epidemiología de campo tiende a la acción sin marco teórico. La epidemiología social, por el contrario, tiende a los desarrollos teóricos (reflexión e investigación sobre los determinantes sociales) alejados de la acción, debido a los limitantes para cambiar las políticas públicas. Otras diferencias se sitúan en el nivel de intervención (micro/macroespacios), el objeto de intervención (control del brote frente a control de las desigualdades) y en la forma de articular la comunicación con la sociedad. Se asemejan en la preocupación por el método, la predominancia de una orientación positivista y condicionada por la estadística, aunque en proceso de cierta apertura epistemológica, la tensión experimentada entre relacionarse con un mundo virtual de bases de datos o con la sociedad real, su situación en la periferia del sistema político-social-institucional-profesional y por estar abocadas a la frustración profesional. Finalmente, se formulan 10 interrogantes a los epidemiólogos de campo sobre su práctica actual, a través de los cuales se podría evaluar si están realizando una epidemiología social, y se sugieren cambios para introducir en la formación y práctica del epidemiólogo. Comparing field epidemiology and social epidemiology, we pretend to think about the no explicit images and meanings operating in both necessary convergent fields, about the obstacles present in epidemiological practice to fulfil its social function and about the necessity of changing epistemological, methodological and practice grounds, beginning with field epidemiologists teaching programmes. Field epidemiology would tend to act in an absent theoretical frame. On the other hand, social epidemiology would tend to prioritize theoretical developments (thinking and research about social determinants) without correspondent action, because of the limits to change public policies. Other differences are found at intervention level (micro-macrospace), its aim (outbreak control vs. inequalities control) and the way to communicate with society. They are similar in the methodological concern, the predominance of orientation based on positivism and framed through statistic methods, but in process of epistemological opening, the stress experienced between the alternative relationship to a virtual world of data bases or to the real society, their peripherical situation in relation of the political, social, institutional and professional system and the tendency to professional frustration. Finally, we ask ten questions to the field epidemiologists related with their present practice, in order to consider if they are developing social epidemiology, and propose some changes in epidemiologist teaching and practice.",

      "title": "Digital social innovation: An overview and research framework",
      "abstract": "Digital social innovation (DSI) involves the use of digital technologies in the development and implementation of innovative products, services, processes and business models that seek to improve the well-being and agency of socially disadvantaged groups or address social problems related to marginality, inequality and social exclusion (Qureshi, Pan, & Zheng, 2017; Shalini et al., 2021). Often, DSI is less about technological innovation and more about social innovation—a process of finding innovative, effective and sustainable solutions to pressing societal challenges, such as those listed in sustainable development goals (SDGs). Thus, technology can be anywhere in the range of simple WhatsApp enabled groups (Parthiban et al., 2021; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020) and advanced blockchain-enabled supply chain (Hota et al., 2021), but its deployment is innovative in tackling wicked social problems, such as poverty, inequality, social exclusion, marginalisation and poor healthcare access (Bhatt et al., 2021; Escobedo et al., 2021; Hota & Mitra, 2021; Jha et al., 2016; Leong et al., 2016; Qureshi et al., 2018). The DSI initiatives can be led by social entrepreneurs, government agencies, charities, trust, non-government organisations (NGOs), cooperatives or corporations under their corporate social responsibilities. However, given the scope and scale of SDGs, such initiatives more likely involve cross-sector partnerships and multiple stakeholders. Various international agencies envisage the role of DSIs in achieving SDGs in three principal ways: providing access to information for example, commodity prices and weather information to the small landholding farmers; providing access to services to marginalised communities for example, education, health and financial services; and measuring and monitoring the SDGs progress for example, evidence-based, real-time measurements (UNGA, 2015; United Nation, 2021). The extant research highlights several instances of DSI, even though the term itself is not used often. For example, a social enterprise in India used a simple battery-operated portable projector to disseminate locally embedded farming best practices (Qureshi et al., 2018). In this special issue, Ravishankar (2021) highlights how a financial intermediary, Rang De, leveraged a digital platform to provide small loans to marginalised farmers. Hota et al. (2021) studied Ethitrade, a social intermediary, which uses advanced block chain technology to provide better prices to rural farmers by establishing provenance. DSI is, therefore, a current and important topic and a promising research area for information systems (IS) and management researchers. Thus, DSI holds tremendous promise at the conceptual, practical and pragmatic levels in addressing social issues and achieving SDGs; however, we have only recently started developing a theoretical understanding of this complex and fast-emerging phenomenon. As of now, this stream of research mostly focuses on issues around accessing information and services but has paid scant attention to issues related to measuring and monitoring SDGs progress (see Table 2). Also, research on ethical dilemmas inherent in engaging with marginalised communities and negotiating various ways power manifests in these contexts has been lacking. This editorial provides a research framework to highlight various stimulating research directions and theoretical lenses to explore them. DSI enables businesses, NGOs, government agencies and social entrepreneurs to leverage digital technologies to generate positive social impacts. These entities can collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions to address a wide range of social needs in disadvantaged, socially excluded and marginalised groups at a scale that was unimaginable before the rise of internet-enabled technologies. In recent years, digital innovations have challenged all aspects of contemporary business models, disrupting, transforming and replacing them with new models regularly. These transformations have been manifested in several ways. Technology-savvy companies have built platforms or utilities exploiting internet-based infrastructure to increase the pace of innovation. These digital innovations led to a paradigm shift in how technology is leveraged to generate value (Parthiban et al., 2021), as exemplified by the sharing economy (Qureshi et al., 2021a), collaborative consumption (Shalini et al., 2021), gig work and crowdsourcing (Deng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020). However, societal outcomes of these digital innovations are at best mixed, as highlighted in privacy and security concerns (Newell & Marabelli, 2015), surveillance (Zuboff, 2019), oppressive and unethical outcomes of algorithms (Kane et al., 2021), and discrimination and exploitation in sharing economy platforms (Attri & Bapuji, 2021; Van Doorn, 2017). Compared to commercial use of information communication technologies (ICTs), the digital transformation in the social space has been less dramatic, especially in using technology to solve wicked social problems (Qureshi, Pan, & Zheng, 2017; Riaz & Qureshi, 2017). Thus, even though there is potential for using these emerging ICTs to address social issues, that potential remains largely unfulfilled, representing an opportunity to create social value through DSI. These social values form the crux of the UN's SDGs that aim at peaceful and prosperous existence for everyone in the society. However, social issues described as part of the UN's SDGs present a list of interminable, critical and intractable problems that require innovative and socially embedded solutions that leverage digital technology. With the role and finances of governments shrinking in many countries and NGOs struggling to raise funds, the wicked social problems identified under the SDGs cannot be addressed without the participation of every segment of society, including corporations, business professionals and academics. At the same time, because the COVID-19 pandemic - a highly infectious disease caused by a form of coronavirus - has left deep scars and threatened our survival in many aspects, a question worth pondering is whether IS, as a discipline, has paid adequate attention so far to issues about sustainability. We think IS can do more (cf. Kane et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2015; Walsham, 2012). COVID-19 has catalysed the use of online platforms for offices and educational institutions, digital modes for monetary transactions and mobile phones for spreading awareness (De et al., 2020), but these changes hold major implications for sustainability, which continues to remain under-researched. We sincerely believe that given the centrality of the relation between technology (in particular information technology) and society in the post-pandemic world, IS scholars are in a unique position to contribute to both research and practice pertaining to sustainability and many other grand societal challenges. In particular, IS research can shed light on the multi-disciplinary knowledge of SDGs and, more importantly, contribute to achieving SDGs. Given the solid foundation of multi-disciplinary expertise developed, we posit that DSI presents an opportunity and a challenge to IS and management scholars equipped with the necessary expertise, global networks and social motivation to generate positive social impact. For example, identifying and extending theories that can help us understand the role ICTs can play in achieving the UN's SDGs will go a long way in generating new insights in the field relevant to at least 4.5 billion people. In addition, many multi-lateral organisations and corporations have publicly declared their support for SDGs. Many organisations have committed to audacious goals of net zero emissions targets in line with a 1.5 C future. These public declarations are likely to create competitive pressure; and some companies, corporations and agglomerations may leapfrog to organise partnerships, restructure processes and position their services and products to project themselves as leaders in sustainable development. Such competition will open up a whole suite of opportunities for scholars to study the phenomenon of DSI at various levels and across those levels. However, on the flip side, corporations have engaged in greenwashing, hijacked green movements, created precarious work in the name of sharing economy and designed elaborate algorithms that track users' every action online (Delmas & Burbano, 2011; Kalleberg, 2009; Kane et al., 2021; Newell & Marabelli, 2015; Van Doorn, 2017; Zuboff, 2019). Understanding how DSIs can overcome these issues represent opportunities for generating critical insights needed for the evolution of this field. As we learned from combating the COVID-19 pandemic, there are research opportunities for IS researchers who aspire to tackle SDGs (Pan & Zhang, 2021). In particular, the SDGs represent significant new opportunities and challenges for organisations that would like to engage base-of-the-pyramid11 We intentionally use the term base-of-the-pyramid (Kistruck et al., 2013; Parthiban et al., 2021) instead of bottom-of-the-pyramid (Prahalad, 2004). Our discomfort with bottom-of-the-pyramid is due to its unfortunate origin in selling to poor and creating fortune for multinational companies (refer to seminal critique by Karnani, 2007). In addition, the term is condescending at its best and derogatory at its worst, as it refer to these populations as \"bottom\". In contrast, the base-of-the-pyramid acknowledges that these populations represent the foundation (base) of humanity, on which everything else is built. The focus of the base-of-the-pyramid initiatives are on developing capabilities, generating livelihoods, and empowering these populations (Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay et al., 2020, 2021; Qureshi et al., 2018; Shalini et al., 2021). producers, artisans and employees (Madon & Sharanappa, 2013; Parthiban et al., 2021; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020; Qureshi et al., 2018; Shalini et al., 2021). The investment needed to achieve UN's SDGs is estimated to be up to US$3 trillion a year for 15 years (Goldsmith, 2015). Addressing SDGs will create competencies within these organisations to cooperate in these environments and develop cross-sector partnerships. To achieve SDGs, we must leverage existing and widely deployed technologies, develop new innovative services and improve the reach of technological solutions. ICTs are poised to play an extended role in today's developing countries (Faik & Walsham, 2013). As witnessed in the mobile phone diffusion phenomenon (Meso et al., 2005), the developing countries could potentially leapfrog through their use of mobile platform-based applications to achieve digital transformation. This leapfrogging would enable them to close the technological gap with developed countries at a much faster rate than previously anticipated (Datta, 2011; Davison et al., 2000; Tim, Pan, Ractham, & Kaewkitipong, 2017), representing exciting possibilities to leverage ICTs for designing innovative solutions. Here, it is important to note that leapfrogging in technology for its sake will not provide any tangible benefits to those who are most marginalised. These technological advancements should be coupled with social innovation to leapfrog in the human development index. We see in developed as well as developing countries that ICTs are increasingly enabling and driving the transformation of the most expensive public services such as healthcare, education, energy, agriculture and environmental monitoring and protection (Pan et al., 2006; Pee et al., 2021; Riaz & Qureshi, 2017; Rose et al., 2015; Stahl et al., 2012). Digitisation has transformed the global value chain and supported innovative models such as cloud work, socially responsible outsourcing or impact sourcing (Heeks & Arun, 2010; Kannothra et al., 2017; Malik & Nicholson, 2020), social intermediation (Kistruck et al., 2013), social entrepreneurship (Bhatt et al., 2019; Qureshi et al., 2016) and social business (UNCTAD, 2017). Digital platforms and crowdsourcing have led to innovative social solutions and services in the third sector, such as more fluid, decentralised and dynamic ways of organising collective action (Bennett & Segerberg, 2012) and disaster response (Tim, Pan, Ractham, & Kaewkitipong, 2017) and funding new forms of NGOs and charitable programmes (Zheng & Yu, 2016). In addition, open-source software (OSS), open data or even open ICT ecosystems have been widely applied in government service, education and healthcare (Qureshi & Fang, 2011; Smith & Elder, 2010; Smith & Reilly, 2013). However, we do not assume that ICTs are the solutions for SDGs. We acknowledge the negative consequences of ICTs, such as rising income inequalities, excessive electricity consumption leading to pollution, oppressive and exploitative algorithms, discriminatory sharing economy platforms, social media-induced polarisation and surveillance. Thus, ICTs can result in dystopian outcomes if not carefully curated. In the following section, we provide a research framework for DSI, where social takes precedence over digital. By integrating research in ICTs for development, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, we propose a framework to understand the process of DSI and identify interesting research avenues (see Figure 1). Organisations and agencies engaged in development activities, especially at the base-of-the-pyramid (Attri & Bapuji, 2021; Hota & Mitra, 2021; Kistruck et al., 2013), encounter issues related to agency and social structures (Bhatt, 2021; Bhatt et al., 2019; Pillai, Pandey, & Bhatt, 2021). These organisations possess agency to bring change, but that agency is constrained by social structures, informal institutions and local norms (Battilana, 2006; Garud et al., 2007; Qureshi et al., 2016). Likewise, organisations involved in DSI have some agency to bring change but need to be socially embedded in the context (Avgerou & Li, 2013; Hota et al., 2019; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020). Without agency, no social change is possible (Emirbayer & Mische, 1998). While organisations engaged in the base-of-the-pyramid do not possess absolute agency, they cannot let the social context dictate their actions entirely, as that would prevent any meaningful social change (Faik et al., 2020; Qureshi et al., 2018). Therefore, these organisations need to exercise embedded agency (Garud et al., 2007; Qureshi et al., 2016). Their agency results, in part, from their ability to bring external knowledge and resources (Hota et al., 2019; Parthiban et al., 2021; Shalini et al., 2021), their ICT expertise (Krauss, 2018; Leong et al., 2015; Qureshi et al., 2021a) and their reflexivity (Claus et al., 2021; Krauss, 2018; Qureshi, Riaz, & Ruebottom, 2017; van Wijk et al., 2020). In contrast, as shown in Figure 1, their social embeddedness helps them be aware of local formal and informal institutions (Bernardi et al., 2019; Masiero & Prakash, 2020; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020), leverage local knowledge and resources (Escobedo et al., 2021; Hota et al., 2019; Karanasios & Slavova, 2019) and navigate exploitative social structures (Iivari et al., 2018; Qureshi et al., 2018; Riaz & Qureshi, 2017). In Table 1, we provide a list of research questions on how digital social innovators (DSIrs) leverage agency and social embeddedness, and we provide theoretical lenses to explore these questions. The list is intended to be representative of the field, not exhaustive. We organise these research questions under the themes of agency, social embeddedness and embedded agency (see Table 1). How do DSIrs catalyse and mobilise local actors to bring social change? Collective action (Ghobadi & Clegg, 2015; Leong, Faik, et al., 2020; Sæbø et al., 2020; Thapa et al., 2012; Young, 2018; Young et al., 2019; Zheng & Yu, 2016) What role DSI plays in social movements, and how social movements catalyse DSI? Social movements (Ghobadi & Clegg, 2015; Leong, Faik, et al., 2020; McKenna, 2020; Miranda et al., 2016; Young et al., 2019) The embedded agency of DSIrs helps them simultaneously understand their capabilities (agency) and the constraints imposed by their social embeddedness. In addition, this embedded agency helps identify various challenges faced by the communities the DSIrs would like to serve and their ability to address those challenges. Thus, the embedded agency helps DSIrs to identify opportunities to make the most significant social impact. Given that the DSI initiatives focus on creating social value and social impact (Qureshi, Pan, & Zheng, 2017), these initiatives can be understood based on their impact on SDGs. In Table 2, we have categorised the studies into various SDGs based on our reading of research reported in these papers. We also note theories or perspectives used in these studies. Entrepreneurship literature has recognised the importance of imagination, creativity and serendipity in innovation (Amabile, 1988; Dew, 2009; Ward, 2004) and in discovering or creating opportunities (Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Barreto, 2012). Thus, most of the theories in entrepreneurial opportunity research can be categorised into opportunity discovery and opportunity creation. In Table 3, we provide various research questions and theories related to opportunity discovery and opportunity creation by DSIrs. In appreciation of the differences between DSI and commercial innovation, rather than entirely relying on commercial entrepreneurship, we integrate theories from social entrepreneurship and digital entrepreneurship. Does the focus of DSIrs on sustainable development goals result in the creation of new opportunities? Does leveraging digital technologies in the process of social innovation create new opportunities? How should DSIrs incorporate digital artefacts to create new opportunities? What roles do collective action and social movements play in opportunity creation by DSIrs? Any implementation of DSI needs to account for social context and social hierarchies. Unlike digital divide research, which is mostly concerned with access issues on account of lack of digital infrastructure, digital literacy and other relevant skills (Diaz Andrade & Doolin, 2016; Zheng & Walsham, 2021), DSI research should account for the complex Web of social structures, informal institutions and intersectionality (Qureshi et al., 2018; Rajão & Marcolino, 2016; Thompson, 2012) that results in social and digital exclusion (Zheng & Walsham, 2008). Provisioning access to digital technologies, although important, is only a first step. In many instances, even when access to physical devices is provided, the social structures prevent any meaningful participation (Iivari et al., 2018; Qureshi et al., 2018; Riaz & Qureshi, 2017). Thus, to create any meaningful social impact on selected SDGs, DSIrs need to prioritise addressing social issues over technological finesse. We label this construct as the social-first approach. The social-first approach distinguishes the societal platform from the commercial platform. Societal platforms represent a collaborative approach to address grand societal challenges or wicked problems at scale, sustainably and with speed.22 Societal platforms is an emerging paradigm for creating public goods through enabling co-creation and amplifying interactions. More information can be found here: https://societalplatform.org/. Our second construct emanates from the social-first approach. DSIrs should strive to maximise social impact; if a simple and primitive digital technology can achieve that goal, so be it. Thus, DSIrs should adhere to the principle of technoficing. Building on the concept of satisficing33 Satisficing occurs on account of the bounded rationality of the decision-maker, leading to inefficient outcomes (Simon, 1957, 1979). Satisficing happens because of the decision-maker's cognitive limits in identifying and evaluating all possible options (Williamson, 1985), resulting in them settling for the good enough option rather than pursuing the best option. (March, 1991; Simon, 1957, 1979) and socialficing44 Socialficing is \"the purposeful pursuit of social objectives at the expense of financial efficiency … While satisficing equates rationality with financial efficiency maximisation, socialficing equates rationality with taking actions that best further what are often complex social and financial organisational objectives\" (Kistruck et al., 2013, pp. 60–61). (Kistruck et al., 2013), we define technoficing as the purposeful pursuit of social objectives using a technology that is good enough and appropriate for the purpose. In fact, a simple technology implemented after embedded engagement with the community can go a long way to achieving goals compared with an advanced technology that is simply thrust on the communities. Our final construct, cultural bricolage (Baker & Nelson, 2005; Rao et al., 2005; Zilber, 2006), is defined as the innovative recombination and ad hoc use of available cultural resources to overcome resource constraints and rigid social hierarchies in addressing wicked social problems (Parthiban, Qureshi, Bhatt, & Bandyopadhyay, 2020; Qureshi et al., 2018). As DSIs are primarily implemented in contexts marked by resource constraints and constraining social norms, DSIrs are required to leverage local cultural resources as much as possible and recombine them innovatively to create possibilities where none exists. Parthiban, Qureshi, Bhatt, and Bandyopadhyay (2020) demonstrate how a DSIr innovatively recombined the cultural \"resources\" of social norms around urban elderly and rural education to address dual issues of productive aging and access to quality education. Cultural bricolage can be studied in combination with the growing fields of frugal innovation and grassroots innovation (Baker & Nelson, 2005; Desa, 2012; Rosca et al., 2017; Seyfang & Smith, 2007; Smith et al., 2016). In Table 4, we provide various research questions and theories related to structuring DSI, categorising them into social-first, technoficing and cultural bricolage. How do digital social innovators (DSIrs) maximise their social impact? How do DSIrs generate livelihoods for marginalised groups? How do societal platforms emerge? What are the characteristics of societal platforms? How do DSIrs identify appropriate technology for the purpose? How do DSIrs balance between technological innovation and social innovation? How do DSIrs achieve cultural resource recombination to enhance social impact? What role does cultural bricolage play in frugal innovation by DSIrs? How do DSIrs overcome resource constraints through cultural bricolage? Cultural resources recombination (Baker & Nelson, 2005; Di Domenico et al., 2009; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bhatt, & Bandyopadhyay, 2020); Frugal innovation (Rosca et al., 2017); grassroots innovation (Seyfang & Smith, 2007; Smith et al., 2016; Zorina & Karanasios, 2021); resources constraints (Bhatt et al., 2019; Hota et al., 2019) SDGs present opportunities as well as a daunting challenge because of the sheer breadth and depth of issues facing global communities. Thus, any successful idea that has the potential to improve any of the SDGs needs to be quickly scaled (André & Pache, 2016; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020). While there is an apparent urgency to scale social impact (Dembek et al., 2016) and, by extension, DSI, research has indicated that current approaches to scaling the organisation rather than the idea are full of pitfalls (Grimes et al., 2019; Onyx et al., 2018). Scaling impact by scaling organisations may not always be a practical or sustainable strategy considering the various costs and agency-related issues (Cannatelli, 2017; Grimes et al., 2020). In fact, in some cases, the scaling of organisations has resulted in organisations drifting away from their social mission (Klein et al., 2020; Ometto et al., 2019). Finally, many SDGs are classified as wicked problems due to the complexities involved, and no single organisation can tackle them effectively alone (Head & Alford, 2015). Therefore, DSIrs are increasingly looking towards creating partnerships that might help them increase their social impact. One such example Catalyst2030, a collaboration platform for social enterprises, is engaged in addressing SDGs, including through DSIs. One of the most high-profile DSI examples, M-Pesa mobile money, showcases the importance of public–private partnerships. Emerging research in this domain has suggested that DSIrs seeking to scale their impact need to account for the peculiarities of social intermediation and market linkages (Hota et al., 2019; Kistruck et al., 2013; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020; Shalini et al., 2021), the open and emergent nature of innovations for the base-of-the-pyramid population (Madon & Schoemaker, 2021; Parthiban et al., 2021), and the need for intensive learning and strategical \"drift\" to achieve adaptive innovation (Foster & Heeks, 2013). Literature on scaling has identified, broadly, six approaches to scaling social impact (André & Pache, 2016; Bhatt et al., 2021; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020) that are relevant to DSI: scaling by diversification, scaling up, scaling across, scaling deep, ecosystem approach and scaling by bridging complementary institutional voids (BCIVs; see Table 5). Scaling by diversification, also known as growing the organisation, refers to using the same channel or platform to tackle multiple SDGs by providing multiple services and products. Scaling up, another approach to growing the organisation, is a strategy of increasing impact of DSI by reaching more beneficiaries in different locations, which requires the organisation to scale its capacities and logistics to serve more beneficiaries with different needs. Scaling across, also known as growing the idea, uses an open innovation approach that focuses on disseminating and sharing the DSI with other DSIrs to let the idea grow and, by extension, lead to a higher social impact. Scaling deep is an approach where DSIrs engage with the same communities and on the same SDG over a long period to improve targeted outcomes substantially. The ecosystem approach to scaling acknowledges that SDGs are targeted to wicked problems that can be beyond any individual DSIr. It leverages the power of many to tackle complex problems. In this approach, various organisations synergise their DSI to tackle large-scale intractable problems of SDGs (Bhatt et al., 2021). Scaling by BCIVs is an approach where DSIrs identify two complementary SDGs and use DSI to address them simultaneously. Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al. (2020) provided an example where educated retired urban elderly were engaged through a platform in decent and meaningful work (SDG#8, decent work and economic growth) to help overcome the lack of teachers in a rural area to provide quality education to poor kids (SDG#4, quality education). How do digital social innovators (DSIrs) leverage technology to bring more products and services? How do DSIrs decide which product or services to bring to maximise social impact? How do DSIrs decide the degree of open innovation in digital social innovation (DSI)? To what extent should scaling across leverage crowdsourcing? What are the trade-offs between open innovation and controlling DSI, and how do DSIrs resolve these trade-offs? What are the facilitators and barriers to using social movements and collective actions to scaling across the social innovation? Open innovation (Feller et al., 2011; Madon & Schoemaker, 2021; Parthiban et al., 2021; Yun et al., 2017) Crowdsourcing (Liu et al., 2020; Schlagwein et al., 2019; Taylor & Joshi, 2019) Paradox/tension (Kibere, 2016; Mahrer & Krimmer, 2005; McLennan, 2016; Poole & Van de Ven, 1989; Rajão & Marcolino, 2016; Smith & Lewis, 2011) Collective action (Ghobadi & Clegg, 2015; Leong, Faik, et al., 2020; Sæbø et al., 2020; Thapa et al., 2012; Young, 2018; Young et al., 2019; Zheng & Yu, 2016); social movements (Ghobadi & Clegg, 2015; Leong, Faik, et al., 2020; McKenna, 2020; Miranda et al., 2016; Young et al., 2019) Does long-term engagement of DSIrs develop capabilities in local communities? If so, how? Capability approach (Cibangu, 2020; Diaz Andrade & Doolin, 2016; Kleine et al., 2012; Nemer, 2016; Poveda & Roberts, 2018; Zheng & Walsham, 2008) Does the long-term engagement of DSIrs make local communities resilient? If so, how? Resilience framework (Heeks & Ospina, 2019; Tim et al., 2021) Empowerment (Alao et al., 2017; Bailur et al., 2018; Pandey & Zheng, 2020) Does long-term engagement transform local institutions? If so, how? Institutionalisation (Bernardi et al., 2019; Madon et al., 2009; Masiero & Prakash, 2020; Silva & Backhouse, 2003) How do DSIrs structure ecosystems for scaling social impact? What role does value co-creation play in structuring ecosystems for social impact? How do DSIrs leverage cross-sector partnerships to structure ecosystems for scaling social impact? Ecosystem approach (Acs et al., 2018; Bhatt et al., 2021; Jha et al., 2016) Value co-creation (Barraket & Loosemore, 2018; Ostertag et al., 2021; Parthiban et al., 2021) Cross-sector partnership (Di Domenico et al., 2009; Selsky & Parker, 2005) How do DSIrs identify complementary institutional voids? Institutional voids (Mair & Marti, 2009; Parthiban, Qureshi, Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2020) How is DSI designed to leverage technology to achieve through BCIVs?

      "title": "Проблемные ситуации в менеджменте",
      "abstract": "There is a type of management tasks which have a high level of initial uncertainty, complexity, uniqueness and presence of multiple stakeholders. Management situations are characterized not only by uncertainty conditions, but the presence of social relations arising between members of the organization that makes the process of resolving extremely complex. The process of dealing with such situations requires a correct understanding of the real-life issues and the organization of collective work, because of their complexity. The relevance of the chosen topic is determined by the importance of initial (prior to the formulation) stage of solving the managerial situation, which is rarely the subject of research. The terms “a problem” and “a problem situation” in management are distinguished on the basis of the concepts of “wicked” problems of H.W. J. Rittel & M.M. Webber, well-structured and ill-structured problems of H. Simon, and other researchers. Two main areas of finding a solution to a problem situation in the initial stages are defined in general terms: the primary data collection about a problem situation and reaching a shared understanding; and coordination of the stakeholders’ positions. These areas derive from the complexity of management situations as mental and social constructions. The process of structuring the problem situation is determined as a process of verbal description translation into the formal problem due to the characteristics of the problem situation. Systems’ approach is proposed for finding solutions as a way of perceiving and understanding the world based on a holistic perception of the situation, and which is designed to simplify the process of thinking and managing complex situations. To deal with problem situations it is suggested to use Problem structuring methods (PSMs) based on modeling that relate to the soft system methodologies. Cognitive maps are considered to be one of the modeling tools. The article attempts to make up for a shortage in the domestic literature and management practices research on the PSM application.",

      "title": "Intercultural encounters as socially constructed experiences : which concepts? which pedagogies?",
      "abstract": "Intercultural encounters in the workplace are frequently plurilingual, intercultural, socially constructed\r\ninteractions that are situated in time, place, space, and purpose. Competence in\r\none encounter can very quickly manifest as incompetence in another supposedly similar\r\ncontext. This complexity puts into question formulaic, essentialist models of intercultural\r\ncommunication and competence that have characterised much cross-cultural\r\nbusiness/management education. While these approaches provide some insights into\r\nbehaviour and communication of people in “Culture X”, they often result in stereotyping,\r\ngrounded in ethnocentric and prejudiced attitudes; and this stereotyping, in turn, may lead to\r\n“othering”.\r\nOne response to these static models of how culture is understood has seen the rise in\r\npopularity of theories and models of intercultural competence, often subscribing to the idea\r\nthat communication with (cultural) others should be both “appropriate” and “effective” to\r\nenable individuals to “achieve their goals”. This position is exemplified in the definition\r\noffered by Spitzberg and Changnon (2009)—which emerged from their in their seminal\r\nsynthesis of multiple models of intercultural competence—as “the appropriate and effective\r\nmanagement of interaction between people who, to some degree or another, represent\r\ndifferent or divergent affective, cognitive, and behaviour orientations to the world” (p. 7).\r\nThus, the term “intercultural competence” and the variety of models, frameworks, and\r\ntheories in its name, have come to be seen by some in the cross-cultural communication\r\nliterature as both a panacea and a solution when interacting with people from other cultures.\r\n2\r\nIn this chapter I begin by outlining some reasons why traditional cross-cultural management\r\neducation and training approaches are no longer appropriate in the second decade of the 21st\r\ncentury, and some shortcomings of the theoretical concept “intercultural competence”. I\r\ndiscuss how terms like “culture” and “identity”, when no longer treated as solid and static\r\nstates, and multilingualism offer possibilities for new understandings of intercultural\r\nencounters. In my own teaching approach I encourage students to engage in practices and in\r\nresearch and assessment tasks that invite them to move beyond a preoccupation with\r\naggregate and/or static models of culture and cultural differences. By drawing on social\r\nconstructionism as a theoretical standpoint for understanding and experiencing intercultural\r\nencounters, I provide a possible pedagogy and possible assessment approach that invites\r\nlearners to consider more deeply the nature of intercultural encounters, and simultaneously,\r\nmonitor their own intercultural communication within them.",

The dominant paradigm regarding economic systems of development and organisation has influenced not only the scope of sustainable development, but also an increasingly depoliticised vision of social work knowledge and practice. Inattention to structural determinants of social inequalities limits the scope for radical, sustained change. The Capability Approach’s recognition of poverty and development as complex, multidimensional phenomena aligns with social work values, while social work’s well-established and reflexive direct-level practice may provide the applied knowledge needed in the theory.",

      "title": "Teilhabefokus und Soziologie sozialer Probleme. Eine Erkundung zu Forschungspotenzialen am Beispiel der Behinderungsfrage",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Teilhabeforschung hat Potenzial. Dies kann für das Feld der sozialen Probleme analysiert werden. Wie gesellschaftlicher Zusammenhalt in Verschiedenheit gelingen kann, wird hier am Beispiel der Vielfaltsdimension Behinderung systematisch reflektiert. Gerade mit Aufmerksamkeit für die Überschneidungen von Diversitätsmerkmalen wird dabei aufgedeckt, wie Behinderung als soziales Problem entsteht. Diskurse um Diversität und Inklusion erweisen sich zusätzlich in der Ungleichheitsforschung als nützlich, weil sie die Diversitätsdimension Behinderung aus einem Schattendasein ins angemessene Licht rücken und zugleich den historisch gewachsenen festen Zugriff der Eingliederungshilfe auf dieses Handlungsfeld lockern. Zudem etablieren sich Diversität und Inklusion als sozialwissenschaftliche Trendsetter. Eine Abgrenzung des Teilhabekonzepts als relativ reale Realität von ihnen gelingt jedoch nur schwer. In einem heraufziehenden Inklusions-Diversitäts-Dilemma kann Teilhabeforschung als Mediatorin agieren. Denn aus den andauernden Diskursen zur Teilhabe lassen sich Aspekte für planvolles Durchdenken und Gestalten ableiten. Passgenau in den jeweiligen Handlungsfeldern entsteht schließlich Teilhabe durch Teilhabe. Wichtig ist dabei zum einen eine verbindende kulturelle bzw. menschenrechtliche Perspektive: Alle sind gleich. Ebenso liegt die konstruktive Auseinandersetzung mit der Gegenwartsgesellschaft der Vielfältigen auf der Hand, denn alle sind verschieden, wobei schließlich drittens auch die Sicht auf Teilhabe inklusive zentral wirkt, denn sie lädt dazu ein, Abschied zu nehmen von Gleichschaltungsanliegen. Stattdessen fördert sie Formen der Gemeinschaft, in der Selbstbestimmung und Teilhabe, Vielfalt und Gleichwertigkeit, Inklusion und Exklusion als Entdeckungszusammenhang in Teilhabefeldern verwoben sind. So gelangen Verfahren der Inklusion als genereller gesellschaftlicher Wandlungsprozess, als Strategie der Grenzüberschreitung und des Zutritts in Greifweite.",

      "abstract": "[TESI NON DISPONIBILE]\r\nLe persone sono spesso confrontate con problematiche quotidiane di svariata natura. Problemi per i quali non e necessario l’intervento di un servizio specifico o di professionisti e per i quali si fa affidamento alla propria rete primaria. In mancanza di essa il compito va affidato alle istituzioni che pero hanno mandato di agire su altri livelli e su problematiche per le quali e necessario un intervento puntuale e professionale. L’obbiettivo di questo lavoro di tesi e quello di ideare e progettare uno strumento che possa servire a far fronte a tutte quelle situazioni legate a una carenza o totale mancanza di reti primarie disponibili ad aiutare i singoli individui a risolvere problematiche quotidiane. La rete primaria e un insieme di legami e conoscenze che gli individui hanno attorno a se, ai quali fanno affidamento nel caso siano confrontati con situazioni che non sono in grado di risolvere da soli e per le quali non c’e la necessita di un professionista. Qualora questo tipo di aiuto non possa giungere, si cercano persone di riferimento alle quali domandare supporto; in questo processo gli operatori sociali possono diventare, agli occhi di queste persone, dei sostituti della propria rete primaria. In questo caso verranno sottoposte delle richieste che l’operatore non potra risolvere completamente dovendo dirigere il proprio operato verso priorita maggiori. Dal momento che la problematica persiste, in questo progetto si cerca di trovare un modo per dare la possibilita agli stessi richiedenti di trovare delle soluzioni all’interno della comunita stessa. Questo progetto va a delineare uno strumento, una piattaforma online, che permetta alle persone di condividere le reciproche problematiche e trovare delle persone disposte ad aiutarsi reciprocamente. L’assistente sociale avra il compito di introdurre gli iscritti alle regole principali del progetto e di seguirli nelle fasi iniziali, promuovendo lo scambio e l’aiuto reciproco per poi pian piano distaccarsi dal progetto e lasciare che diventi un processo gestito dagli stessi iscritti. L’obbiettivo principale di questo progetto e quello di permettere alle persone di trovare uno spazio dove potersi aiutare a vicenda sopperendo alla mancanza o alla carenza di una rete primaria individuale. Tramite questi scambi e possibile anche che si generi una dimensione nella quale le persone riescano a trovare negli altri, figure significative che possano divenire parte della propria rete di aiuto. \r\nIl progetto segue diversi punti chiave del lavoro sociale di comunita e della cittadinanza attiva e li analizza in maniera tale che siano confrontati con la dimensione pratica del progetto stesso. Il servizio sociale cui fa riferimento questo progetto e quello de contesto comunale essendo esso delineato in una zona specifica ed avendo contatti diretti con il territorio con cui opera. La ricerca di questa piattaforma va a progettare un approccio che trasformi la stessa utenza dei servizi comunali in risorsa per la comunita e in generatori di reti di auto aiuto per far fronte a delle problematiche comuni ad ognuno di noi.",

      "title": "Playable problems: game-design thinking for civic problem-solving",
      "abstract": "As interest grows in involving stakeholders in problem-solving around resilience strategies, the biggest hurdle is creating mechanisms through which people can meaningfully contribute. Organizations big and small are calling for increased participation and greater public engagement, but too often the response to this call is another community forum or online poll. While design thinking methods are becoming popular, and can provide useful strategies for simplifying complexity and focusing on outcomes, they often gloss over nuance of culture, power and experience. In this chapter, I advocate for the use of game design as a method of group ideation and problem-solving in the context of social resilience. Specifically, this approach asks participants to identify the 'playable problem', or the goal of the game whereby rules and mechanics can be designed to guide players through an experience. In transforming large wicked problems, like lack of community connectedness, into smaller 'playable problems', such as not having informal gathering spaces in the community, participants can imagine a balanced system where a player is seeking to forge connections with neighbors and comes up against obstacles in such a way that forces him or her to imagine new paths or tactics. I do not suggest that problems should be solved through game play; rather, through game-design thinking, participants can reframe civic issues around the experience of a player moving through a system. This chapter details the game-design thinking process and provides examples of its use in a youth advocacy project in India.",

La investigacion se centra en los puntos del espectro social que, junto con otros de naturaleza linguistica, estimulan todavia la eleccion de la perifrasis prepositiva ( deber de ), en un marco general mucho mas favorable a la variante no prepositiva ( deber ) en todo el mundo hispanico. Desde el punto de vista sociolectal, el estudio revela una notable complejidad, ya que en la comunidad se dan cita normas sociolinguisticas aparentemente contradictorias, pero que de consuno actuan en una misma direccion, preservando todavia el empleo de dicha variante. Factores como el sexo, la edad y el nivel de instruccion son seleccionados como significativos por el aparato estadistico multivariante, pero su alcance difiere entre unos sectores sociales y otros. Esta heterogeneidad sociolectal podria explicarse por el hecho de que, frente a otros fenomenos de variacion sintactica con mayor saliencia normativa, como el dequeismo, el analizado en estas paginas se halla sometido a reglas preceptivas cuyo alcance—la oposicion modal epistemico-deontica—es mas complejo, y en el fondo, desconocido por la mayoria.",

      "title": "Socially awkward: how can we better promote walking as a social behaviour?",
      "abstract": "Walking—whether for exercise, recreation or transport—often occurs within the bounds of the families, communities and neighbourhoods in which we live. It is a behaviour shaped by our physical and social environment, including social norms and networks.1 Recent advocacy work has seen great strides made in calling for changing the physical (built) environment to support physical activity and walking behaviour. However, built environments are difficult and costly to change. Using inherent social structures in our societies may provide a cost-efficient way of encouraging people to walk and better use the built environment in which we live, work and play, and promote population-level change. These social factors may also have a key role to play in the maintenance of walking behaviour (as we are all embedded in these networks) and ‘scaling up’ nationwide and worldwide interventions (based on the principles of social norms).\n\nWalking, as a social behaviour, is influenced by our social networks (ie, the people around us). Social norms—the standards of behaviour that are considered acceptable or appealing in a group or society—are also important for walking. Yet seldom are these networks or norms taken into account when promoting walking behaviour, and they are subsequently underutilised in our interventions.2 Promoting walking to individuals without considering these social constructs inherent in ‘social settings’ (such as schools, workplaces, parks, neighbourhoods, streets and public spaces) may risk missing opportunities to more effectively produce behaviour change or maintained behaviour change. We may also be missing …",

      "title": "Identity, Dignity and Taboos: Beliefs as Assets",
      "abstract": "We analyze social and economic phenomena involving beliefs which people value and invest in, for affective or functional reasons. Individuals are at times uncertain about their own \"deep values\" and infer them from their past choices, which then come to define \"who they are.\" Identity investments increase when information is scarce or when a greater endowment of some asset (wealth, career, family, culture) raises the stakes on viewing it as valuable (escalating commitments). Taboos against transactions or the mere contemplation of tradeoffs arise to protect fragile beliefs about the \"priceless\" value of certain assets (life, freedom, love, faith) or things one \"would never do.\" Whether such behaviors are welfare-enhancing or reducing depends on whether beliefs are sought for a functional value (sense of direction, self-discipline) or for \"mental consumption\" motives (self-esteem, anticipatory feelings). Escalating commitments can thus lead to a \"hedonic treadmill,\" and competing identities cause dysfunctional failures to invest in high-return activities (education, adapting to globalization, assimilation), or even the destruction of productive assets. In social interactions, norm violations elicit a forceful response (exclusion, harassment) when they threaten a strongly held identity, but further erode morale when it was initially weak. Concerns for pride, dignity or wishful thinking lead to the inefficient breakdown of Coasian bargaining even under symmetric information, as partners seek to self-enhance and shift blame by turning down \"insultingly low\" offers.",

Social connectedness refers to the subjective awareness of being in close interpersonal, meaningful, and positive social relationships and social contexts (Tilburg et al., 1998; Perlman & Paplau 1981). In our research project we studied whether new services and high-tech products can help to increase connectedness between families (i.e. small community). A multidisciplinary approach is adopted in which technical and Human Factors knowledge are combined. The technology approach is strongly based on rapid prototyping, extending, reusing, and integrating existing devices and services in a novel, innovative way. Human Factors knowledge aims at user-centred design and evaluation of a.o. user experiences.\r\nWhen people are forced to leave their home environment for a period of time, the lack of social connectedness might become predominant. This might lead to feelings of loneliness and have a negative effect on wellbeing. The focus in this project is on spinal cord lesion patients in a rehabilitation clinic, and their family members at home. Spinal cord lesion patients have to stay in the rehabilitation clinic up to one year after their accident or illness.\r\nThe project consists of three phases:\r\n1. Inventory of technology possibilities and restrictions, and user requirements;\r\n2. Technical probe study; one technical device is tested\r\n3. Pilot study; an integrated combination of technological devices and services is tested",

The presence or absence erf \"social deviance\" thus cannot be easily established in many cases, primarily because of the pluralistic nature of some societies. Widespread reactions erf the kind ultimately will destroy the existing social order and mate it impossible for the political or economic leadership of such a society to maintain power or even a semblance of it. In addition to the many factors complicating a systematic examination of \"social deviance\" the analyst is faced with the frustrating fact that human activity is hopelessly intertwined in such a way that political, social, cultural, and economic factors are constantly interacting in daily life. Social pressure was directed against those who cooperated with the authorities, and tax evasion was the norm. The relationship between the individual and society in many respects resembled Banfield's famous \"amoral familism.&quot",

Faced with these imperfectly realized rights, many individuals protest (at least in the interview situation) and take action, negotiate, tinker, adapt, to make their rights more concrete, and in the same movement, to assert themselves as subjects of rights. This everyday politics takes place at a distance from the collectives involved in the politicization of disability, whether they be associations or public officials, towards whom several people make a demand for descriptive representation.",

The society, if it is to remain a society, must express its unity of subpopulations through a commonly held symbol system. The integration of a society is, however, never complete; tension and conflict are constant possibilities and actualities between different subpopulations as well as between different areas of activities. Such tension and conflict between symbol systems have a greater probability of occurring in a relatively differentiated society than in a relatively homogenous society. One area of conflict is that between religious and nonreligious systems. Such conflict is often grounded in the differences of appeal, the one appealing to an absolute, transcendental authority which tends to be sacred (unchanging) and the other appealing to tradition, social relations, expediency, etc. The tension and conflict involving religious systems occur not only between religious and nonreligious systems but also between one religious system and another.",

(2) Transformasi Aktor. perubahan yang dilakukan oleh aktor-aktornya sendiri, perubahan pola kepemimpinan, serta perubahan dalam cara mengadopsi nilai-nilai dan keyakinan yang masih baru. (3) Transformasi Persoalan. Setiap muncul isu atau informasi baru, maka konflik yang ada dan berkembang akan kehilangan sifatnya yang khas, dan mengalami perubahan.yang nyata. Dengan demikian akan dapat ditata kembali persoalan yang akhirnya dapat membuka jalan bagi penyelesaian konflik yang ada atau mungkin berkembang. (4) Transformasi Kelompok dan Personal.

The ideology of no limits and the underlined compulsion to capture all the opportunities, produce a breathless every-day-life, far away from the real ability of many families who (also before the recent financial crisis) are dealing with the difficulty to get the account square. These difficulties produce weakness and illness (particularly depression) especially for a particular social group that could be defined as impoverished middle class or new vulnerable. The area of the vulnerable not only is shifting into poverty, but also, in relationship with the concept of citizenship, shows a growing hostility towards all that is established (State, local authorities, third sector and trade unions). Established institutions are, in fact, simply not representatives and this could means be more sensible to those political languages that try to simplify the reality. The participatory process set up in the last years around the complexity of the social issues, health, environment and urban planning, could be read as valid opportunity to engage, activate and maintain these resources. But this is possible only using appropriate methodological tools able to reinforce the contemporary forms of democracy (now so far to be strong and participate). This requires the spreading of capabilities among operators and managers of the public and no-for-profit sector.

      "abstract": "Managers, in both public and private sectors, are likely to face diverse and complex ethical challenges as they make decisions regarding functions such as hiring, promotions, compensation, suppliers and community affairs. Managers who work in a culturally diverse environment are likely to face even more difficult conflicts and decisions since people of different ethnic backgrounds are likely to have different rankings for various decisions and values [1]. For example, people of low context cultures living in individualistic societies are likely to place a higher level of importance on facts or truth [2] like the universalists, while those living in high context cultures that tend to be collectivistic will place loyalty higher as they function more like particularists [3]. Workers working in high uncertainty avoidance cultures are likely to avoid conflicts that can jeopardize their relationships with superiors or colleagues, while those living in low uncertainty avoidance and low power distance environments tend to take more risks even when this can hurt a relationship in the workplace [4, 5]. Therefore, it is important for modern global managers to be aware of such differences in values, behaviors and expectations. They should always act ethically, while also making sure that they are being seen as socially responsible and culturally competent in order to cohesively and synergistically work with and inspire workers toward creativity, innovation and higher productivity [6].",

The assumption is that the correlation between (unpleasant) work and material compensation should be fair. Indignation appears if the implicit social contract is breached. These interviewees expressed the feeling that they do not receive that which they have earned. In many interviews, indignation is directly connected with a reaffirmation of the social rights to which every citizen is entitled. This reference is made especially with regard to health problems. However, the Bologna material also includes interviews in which indignation based on political assumptions turns into resentment. This seems to occur if people are in competition with each other for available resources.",

Results of a conflict are: 1) Increase the solidarity among members of the group (in-group) which is in conflict with the group elsewhere.2) Rift between the warring factions. 3) Personality changes in individuals, 4) Property damage and loss of human lives. 5) The dominance of conquest even one of the parties involved in the conflict.Â Â Â Attempts to defuse conflicts in achieving stability is called â€œaccommodationâ€.The parties in conflict with each other adjust to the situation by working together.

      "abstract": "Supporting youth in their joining of society is a lofty goal that seems more than worthy and timely to pursue. Support for that pursuit can be found in a number of different research areas of developmental and life span psychology. For instance, Erikson's notion of generativity, an aspect of personality functioning that may develop at around midlife, highlights the importance of the transmission of knowledge and insight between generations for the young and the old, as well as for society (e.g., Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick, 1986). Roger Säljö's chapter refers to another strong tradition in developmental research that has focused on the critical role of social interaction in learning. This research is building on a long tradition that includes the seminal works of scholars such as Baldwin, Piaget, Vygotsky, and Luria. However, although it is one of the fundamental tenets of the social and behavioral sciences that human behavior and development are at least partly a creation of social forces, social interaction, and social transmission, it is also true that theory and method do not always coincide in developmental work. Thus, there is a continuing search for the role of the social-interactive in developmental theory and research.",

      "title": "Spatial and social configurations in offices",
      "abstract": "The strength of space syntax is the potential to describe the interplay between spatial configuration and social behaviour; however, there are some important differences between the space syntax found on the urban level and on the building level. In studies of offices, we have found that integration values do not explain the pattern of movements and the positions of interaction. The average interaction frequency is just the same for workstations in different positions and in different office concepts despite the fact that many “spontaneous” interactions occur when people pass workstations. Although there are some spatial explanations for this homogeneity (the studied offices are shallow systems both when it comes to cellular and to open plan offices), interaction follows organisational borders in an open plan office as these borders act as if they were walls: almost no interaction crosses the department borders in spite of some units being spatially well-integrated. Obviously, the spatial influence in these offices is weak when it comes to encouraging spontaneous interaction across organisational borders. In fact, much of the so-called spontaneous interaction is programmed, even if it is not scheduled. Clearly, visibility is important for social behaviour; we found that office workers have most frequent interaction with nearby and visible co-workers. To some extent, this is an effect of placing people according to the organisation scheme, but still - as we know that work processes in offices are largely formed by context, so this “use” of the neighbours is also an effect of seeing each other every day. We also noted that openness is more problematic when it comes to sound. Many people are disturbed by talking in open plan offices and one conclusion is that work dominated by “long questions” suffers from this conversational overhearing, while work dominated by “short questions” has the possibility to balance the negative effects. There is a need both for new office design and for management strategies that combine spatial and social configurations in a more conscious way. The findings presented in this paper are from studies of seven offices/companies with a total of about 1500 office workers.",

      "abstract": "Most of the social sciences, including psychology, economics and subjective social network theory, are modeled on the individual, leaving the field not only a-theoretical, but also inapplicable to a physics of hybrid teams, where hybrid refers to arbitrarily combining humans, machines and robots into a team to perform a dedicated mission (e.g., military, business, entertainment) or to solve a targeted problem (e.g., with scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs). As a common social science practice, the ingredient at the heart of the social interaction, interdependence, is statistically removed prior to the replication of social experiments; but, as an analogy, statistically removing social interdependence to better study the individual is like statistically removing quantum effects as a complication to the study of the atom. Further, in applications of Shannon's information theory to teams, the effects of interdependence are minimized, but even there, interdependence is how classical information is transmitted. Consequently, numerous mistakes are made when applying non-interdependent models to policies, the law and regulations, impeding social welfare by failing to exploit the power of social interdependence. For example, adding redundancy to human teams is thought by subjective social network theorists to improve the efficiency of a network, easily contradicted by our finding that redundancy is strongly associated with corruption in non-free markets. Thus, built atop the individual, most of the social sciences, economics and social network theory have little if anything to contribute to the engineering of hybrid teams. In defense of the social sciences, the mathematical physics of interdependence is elusive, non-intuitive and non-rational. However, by replacing determinism with bistable states, interdependence at the social level mirrors entanglement at the quantum level, suggesting the applicability of quantum tools for social science. We report how our quantum-like models capture some of the essential aspects of interdependence, a tool for the metrics of hybrid teams; as an example, we find additional support for our model of the solution to the open problem of team size.

      "title": "Historical writing about everyday life",
      "abstract": "'Everyday life' is an enigmatic term which eludes a straightforward or universal definition. The notion is less precise and more complicated than it looks. One reason may be that since 'everyday life' and the categories with which it is described are constituted within specific cultural and historical contexts, we face a host of (often contradictory) concepts.l Yet all approaches to everyday life in contemporary historical writing do have something in common: a concern with the world of ordinary experience (as opposed to society in the abstract) as their point of departure, together with an attempt to view daily life as problematic, in the sense of showing that behaviour or values which are taken for granted in one society are dismissed as self-evidently absurd in another (cf. Burke 1991: 11). For some time historians and social anthropologists have been trying to uncover the latent rules of daily life. The everyday includes actions, which could be defined as the 'realm of routine' (Braudel), and also attitudes, which may be labelled mental habits. Another important aspect in the context of everyday life is ritual. On the one hand, as a marker of special occasions in the life of individuals and communities, ritual is often defined in opposition to the everyday. On the other hand, outsiders and visitors notice everyday rituals such as ways of eating or forms of greeting in the life of every society, which the locals fail to perceive as rituals at all. In this introduction we attempt, first of all, to present some general conceptual and methodological issues which have evolved around the concept of everyday life in European, especially German history. The German debate about 'Alltag' is illuminating, because the discussions have been conducted in an often fierce and 'fundamentalist' way and thus highlight a number of problems inherent in this notion. While the concept of 'everyday life' has provoked a widely recognized and often highly controversial debate in European and American history, it has hitherto been more or less neglected in the context of African history. Although, as will be shown, aspects of everyday life (especially for the colonial period) have recently received increased attention in historical writings on Africa, 'everyday life' as an analytical category has seldom found its way into current Africanist debates. Thus, in order to provide a more adequate framework for research into 'everyday life in colonial Africa', we will address some of the 'achievements' and 'weaknesses' of the everyday life concept that have been discussed in the context of",

      "abstract": "During times of conflict, development agencies must rely on the relationships they have built with local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to seek effective strategies for working on gender issues. In such critical times it is easy to falsely consider the needs of gender equity as secondary to other goals, yet the community at risk will be constrained in achieving other goals if gender inequities exist to impede progress. Raising gender issues with local NGOs can result in strengthened relationships if this is done as part of a long-term strategy. Ad hoc attempts to deal with gender issues, however, can weaken relationships. A strategy for working with local NGOs on gender and conflict may include: 1) joint training workshops, 2) strengthening ties with women's organizations, 3) networking, 4) research, 5) creating a resource-base, 6) training specialist gender staff to integrate gender into technical issues, 7) joint planning, 8) provision of technical resources, 9) establishing dialogues on gender, and 10) seeking allies among influential people in the community.",

      "abstract": "For the most part, current reflections on the social seem to overemphasize either homogeneity (society/nation-state, modernization/globalization) or heterogeneity (sociality, cosmopolitanism). Against this, here the argument is put forward that it is appropriate to think of the social as consisting of aspects of homogeneity or shared frames of reference and aspects of heterogeneity at the same time. This thought is developed particularly in contrast to normative concepts such as Bauman's sociality—republicanism nexus or Beck and Grande's ideas on European cosmopolitanism. With the help of concepts such as sociation, glocalization and conflict, a basis will be developed for the elaboration of particular socials (e.g. Europe) as a general social theory. This avoids falling into normative traps, which are usually risky when starting out from a historical particularity to explain current and future structures and features of notions such as European society.",

Special attention should be paid to difficult-to-solve conflicts due to their extremely unfavorable social consequences. They are characterized by a great complexity of disputable issues, aggression, violence, mutual harm, desire to destroy the opponent, a very escalating character. The persistence of such conflicts causes a sense of hopelessness on the part of the parties involved. Extinguishing or trying to resolve these situations requires extraordinary measures, as traditional dispute resolution strategies such as negotiation and mediation are not effective. “Education for values”, which focuses on identifying fundamental values, cannot be overestimated in the prevention of conflicts that are difficult to resolve. Large differences in values often trigger a conflict process, which is why it is so important to identify a universe accepted by all, which may become a significant inhibitor of hostilities and antagonisms.",

The primary functions subserved by intercommunication in human sociation are those of normative regulation and control, and of the creation, alteration, maintenance, or exploitation of human institutions—which are, in turn, formal or informal \"epistemic communities\" organized around one or a set of \"communicational realities,\" or guiding metaphors. Social institutions persist so long as they serve to provide a sufficient relationship between their constituents and their total communicational environments and so long as they are articulable one with the other. Like \"communication,\" perhaps too much has already been said about \"revolution\" for the term to retain its usefulness for intellectual purposes. Nonetheless, as with communication, there are certain phenomena still to be accounted for; and these perhaps can still best be indexed by the term \"revolution.\".",

      "abstract": "La Mediacion Familiar, como tecnica de resolucion de conflictos de pareja, es un procedimiento relativamente novedoso en Espana. En nuestro pais comienza a desarrollarse a finales de la decada de los anos ochenta, y primeros de los noventa. Sin embargo, en el contexto internacional surge, como se detallara mas adelante, a principios de los anos ochenta; como un procedimiento independiente de otras tecnicas.\nEn este trabajo se intenta desarrollar algunas formas de abordaje, desde nuestra perspectiva social. Tambien se senalan algunos aspectos, importantes en el procedimiento, desde nuestro punto de vista, a tener en cuenta; cuando se aplica este Modelo de Intervencion.\nEste desarrollo teorico-practico ha sido posible realizarlo porque, desde los comienzos de la Mediacion Familiar (por lo menos la que utiliza el abordaje teorico del Enfoque Sistemico o del Ecologico), siempre ha habido trabajadores sociales utilizandolo; o siendo agentes activos en su desarrollo y aplicacion.\nComo Trabajadores Sociales nos interesa el intercambio de informacion y el acceso a todas aquellas tecnicas y campos de intervencion profesional en las que podamos desarrollar nuestra actividad profesional; todo ello, por supuesto, con la adecuada formacion.\nY aqui nos hemos encontrado con una antigua reivindicacion la formacion. Esta claro que no ser Licenciados nos corta mucho las alas y nos resta: cualificacion, expectativas laborales y de formacion, equiparacion con otras profesiones, etc.\nHasta la fecha hemos ido resolviendo esta carencia a traves de Cursos de Formacion, de Post-Grado y Masters con el consecuente perjuicio laboral y economico. No se detecta mucho interes, ni excesiva prisa (tanto por las autoridades academicas, como por las altas instancias de nuestra profesion), en resolver esta situacion.\nEl hecho es que, en la Union Europea, somos uno de los pocos paises que mantiene esta situacion. Esto nos debe llevar a reflexionar que puede ocurrir, cuando se aplique, con todas las consecuencias, la libre circulacion de profesionales en todo el territorio de la Union Europea. Las perspectivas, si no contamos con la Licenciatura y un Plan de Estudios bien elaborado, como en el caso de Alemanis, son poco halaguenas.\nSiguiendo con la Mediacion Familiar a mediados de los anos 90 ya hay Trabajadores Sociales aplicando este Modelo e intercambiando sus experiencias (algunos llevaban cierto tiempo trabajando en ello).\nHay autores y profesionales que opinan que la Mediacion es un campo de trabajo restrictivo (psicologos y abogados) en un contexto cuasi-juridico (y lo hacen asi porque, basicamente, lo enfocan y aplican para llegar a elaborar Separaciones de mutuo-acuerdo; sin mirar mas alla). Sin embargo hay otros (la mayoria) que no aceptan estos argumentos. Defienden que es un contexto de intervencion amplio, donde pueden intervenir diferentes profesionales (si tienen la adecuada formacion), y que, por la experiencia acumulada y la investigacion, han observado que un conflicto de pareja tiene multiples facetas -y requiere diferentes abordajes (y entre ellos se encuentra, evidentemente, el social)-.\nEn mi modesta opinion creo que la segunda opcion es la mas acertada. Ya que es la que abre mas posibilidades y alternativas, de resolucion y conflictos y aprendizaje de pautas y comportamientos, a la pareja.\nEl trabajo que, a continuacion se expone, es el resultado de todo ello.",

      "abstract": "Collective workplaces – such as coworking spaces, open workplan offices, maker spaces, or fab labs – are founded on one central premise: working alongside others leads to interactions, collaborations and access to ‘buzzing’ knowledge. Yet, at the same time, users of these places go there to do their (often freelance) work, requiring a productive, and therefore usually quiet, work environment. Drawing on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in the Netherlands, this research explores how users of collective workplaces navigate the coworking paradox: the need for quiet workplaces and the desire for social interaction. It shows how interactions emerge through rituals and especially routines, and describes the spatio-temporal conditions under which these interactions may lead to successful forms of social exchange and community formation.",

      "title": "Infusing the Study of Social Responsibilities with an Intersectional Approach",
      "abstract": "Social responsibilities are a central component of adolescents' and young adults' development, particularly for those from immigrant backgrounds. Social responsibility-a sense of responsibility and duty that extends beyond the self (Wray-Lake & Syvertsen, 2011) includes both family obligations (Fuligni, 2001; 2007) and community engagement (Jensen, 2008; Lerner et al., 2002). What is often missing, however, are the ways in which social identities and social inequality shape young adult's development of social responsibilities. An intersectional perspective (Crenshaw, 1989; Cole, 2009) is particularly well-suited to do so. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the ways in which an intersectional approach can augment studies of social responsibilities, highlights progress and challenges in the field, and outlines future directions. The majority of extant literature focuses on \"single-axis\" (Bowleg, 2008) static demographic features such as ethnic group differences in values of social responsibilities. An intersectional approach could more meaningfully attend to the ways in which ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, SES, and immigration status come together to shape experiences of social responsibilities. In addition, taking an intersectional approach can provide the tools necessary to understand how social inequality shapes opportunities and necessity for social responsibilities. Future directions for the field are discussed including design, methodological, and analytic choices in conducting future work.",

Hence, a particular domain such as verbal politeness, is established and given a careful attention by educational institutions, in charge of transmitting it. Such transmission is socially selective, so a marked use of verbal politeness, as a sociolinguistically discriminating index, is made as possible. As a result, verbal politeness patterns not only depend upon the ideology of each society at a given historical moment, but they are also a way of contributing to the shaping and development of the prevailing ideological hegemony.

Social support engenders the sense that one is cared for and loved, esteemed and valued, or is part of a network of mutual interpersonal commitments. However, as a formal construct, social support is not easily defined and can be subdivided approximately into structural (quantitative) and functional (qualitative) domains (Helgeson, 2003). The former pertains to the number, structure, and pattern of networks that one maintains with other people or organizations. The mere existence of social ties is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for social support, nor is the absolute number of ties strongly correlated with social support. In fact, some social ties may be intrusive, stressful, or at best, perfunctory.",

      "title": "Informal Social Networks in Organizations: Propositions regarding Their Role in Organizational Behavior Outcomes",
      "abstract": "Network theory examines notion of an informal organization and demonstrates importance of people's networks of relationships (Burt, 1995; Krackhardt & Kilduff, 1990). We assert that large part of work in an organization is done through social relationships and hence suggest that informal social structures offer much explanation of organizational phenomena such as social capital, knowledge transfer, organizational learning, communication, and leadership and power. In fact, informal social networks can potentially enable, but also constrain behavior at work through informal sub-communities of organizational members. Any complex organization has sub-communities of people that are linked to each other through formal reporting structures and informal structures such as friendship networks. The social network is typically defined as a specific set of relations among defined set of persons with additional property that characteristics of these linkages as whole may be used to interpret social behavior of individuals involved (Mitchell, 1969, p.2) Informal networks are those channels that carry information and connect organizational members through routes not prescribed by organization. Networks provide its members with many opportunities such as tracing task information, work standards and expectation, rumors, and social norms. Common hobbies and activities as well as interpersonal attraction, among other factors, play an integral role in development of informal social networks. It is not hard to imagine factors that contribute to formation and growth of informal social networks, which can include lunch schedules, family ties, social relationships and common origins. The positions that people inside informal network occupy are important to analyze. According to Lamertz and Aquino (2004), an informal network position analysis considers dyadic relationships and adds informal relationships to direct relationships specified in network. These network positions aid in explanation of informal status and social power. Further, they indicate distribution of resources and relationships with potential partners in resource exchanges as well as members' associations with popular members of network (Bonacich, 1987; Burt 1976; Freeman, 1979; Lamertz & Aquino, 2004). Past research has provided some tools to investigate network structures with regard to variations in exchange and social behaviors (Uehara, 1990). One of traditional tools is network density, which is defined as extent to which links between people actually exist (Mitchell, 1969). Another important tool is network intensity, which is degree to which individuals are prepared to honor obligations, or feel free to exercise rights implied in their link to some other person (Mitchell, 1969). These tools examine communication among members, which incorporates informal pressures, normative pressures, and facilitation of exchange of support (Mitchell, 1969) According to Allen and colleagues, the existence of informal social networks within organizations has long been recognized as important. (Allen, James, & Gamlin, 2007, p. 179). Adler and Kwon remind us that a growing number of sociologists, political scientists, economists, and organizational theorists have invoked concept of social capital in search for answers to broadening range of questions being confronted in their own fields. (Adler & Kwon, 2002, p. 17). Yet research that offers collection of implications of these informal networks is scant. The purpose of this paper is to offer review of literature on informal social networks with special regard to organizations and to develop research propositions with regard to some organizational behavioral outcomes of these informal social networks. The next section of this paper addresses formation of informal social networks and importance of social exchange and dual exchange theory with regard to informal social networks. …",

Perspectives and opinions on social entrepreneurship are sometimes opposed. A set of factors and different understandings make them so – some are positive, others extremely negative. The topic of the emergence, development, and various substantive features of social entrepreneurship is considered to gain an adequate idea of the essential characteristics of this “phenomenon”. The ambition is to create a clear perspective to point out directions in which involvement in social entrepreneurial initiatives will be effective and efficient. The interweaving of economic theories in socially entrepreneurial and purely entrepreneurial initiatives is inevitable. There are differences between “business entrepreneurship” and “social entrepreneurship” and they are in a substantive aspect, but mostly in a result-oriented direction. Entrepreneurship is defined as the process by which motivated individuals recognize and exploit business opportunities regardless of the resources available to them. Social entrepreneurship is a form of entrepreneurial activity that has an orientation towards social problems. Ambiguities still exist regarding the definition of social entrepreneurship, which is why it is considered easier to describe than to define.",

Durch Wissen kann unter Umstanden Sozialitat, Interaktion, soziales Handeln, Austausch und Individualitat unmoglich gemacht werden. Im Gegenzug vermag Nichtwissen ein individueller und sozialer Mechanismus zur Ermoglichung dieser Moglichkeiten zu sein. Wenn sich die Informations- und Wissenslage z.B. durch ubermasige Uberwachungen so erweitert, dass nur geringe Intransparenz besteht, werden ebenfalls die individuell und gesellschaftlich ermoglichenden positiven Auswirkungen von Nichtwissen wegfallen. Die aktuelle Diskussion scheint die Gefahren von zu viel Wissen und die Chancen von fehlendem Wissen nur unzureichend zu reflektieren.\r\nAus diesen Grunden wird fur eine verstarkte Auseinandersetzung mit Wissen, Nichtwissen, ihren Folgen und eines jeweils individuell, situations- und gesellschaftsangepassten Mischungsverhaltnisses, einer Balance zwischen Wissen und Nichtwissen pladiert, die Potentiale freisetzt, indem sie die eruierten negativen Konsequenzen von Wissen vermeidet und die positiven Folgen von Nichtwissen nutzt. Ein institutionalisiertes und praktiziertes Recht auf Nichtwissen, also eine Kultivierung von Wissens- und Nichtwissensbemuhungen, kann aufgrund rein rational analytischer Uberlegungen und funktionaler Konsequenzen fur Individuum und Gesellschaft nutzlicher sein, als ein ungeregeltes und unbegrenztes Wissen-Schaffen.",

Se trata de un diagnostico de su realidad social y profesional, en el que se analizan las necesidades, proyectos, expectativas, dificultades de integracion e impacto psicosocial de estos trabajadores. Hemos podido constatar que, en la poblacion entrevistada, existe un sensible deterioro del estatus profesional con respecto al que se disponia en el Pais de origen. Dicho deterioro, unido a estrategias de afrontamiento poco eficaces, lleva consigo la aparicion de sintomas clinicos de ansiedad y depresion. El duelo por la perdida de sus referentes culturales es el problema mas importante que hemos podido identificar. Asi mismo, existe una carencia afectiva relacionada, por un lado con la perdida de lazos familiares, diferentes costumbres, distinto clima, etc., y, por otro, con las dificultades para interpretar adecuadamente los codigos empleados en las interacciones sociales con la sociedad receptora.",

Public spaces comprise different physical types: horizontal spaces like roads and pedestrian networks; open green spaces such as squares and parks; and public buildings such as public libraries. Each type serves different, often multiple, purposes such as recreational, educational, and commercial activities. Ownership and management can vary between (1) public ownership and management; (2) private ownership and management; and (3) mixed (public and private) ownership and management. Public spaces owned and managed by governments at different levels can make a significant difference in the quality of life, but overlapping functions and poor coordination among various agencies can prevent effective delivery of municipal services. Mixed (public and private) ownership and management can range from publicly owned but privately managed spaces to long-term public-private partnerships for operating a public space.",

      "title": "To Thine Own Self (And Thine Associates) Be True: the Strategic Management of Competing Identities Among Academic Women.",
      "abstract": "Social positions and social relationships are important in structuring self-concept. The self is often viewed as composed of identities related to the social positions an individual occupies. These identities are generally conceptualized as being organized hierarchically based on the individual's relative commitment to each. I contribute to this work by developing an Identity Management Model in which I propose three strategies (compartmentalization, amalgamation, and reprioritization) individuals use to manage completion among identities. In this model, I identify characteristics of (a) the identities, (b) the social environment and (c) the individual's social network that are likely to influence which strategy is used in a particular situation. I then formulate hypotheses regarding the effect of specific characteristics. For example, I hypothesize that (1) the greater the density of an individual's social network the less likely he or she is to compartmentalize master identities; (2) the amalgamation of identities is more likely for those identities that are broad in scope and potentially relevant in a wide range of social settings; and (3) the amalgamation of competing identities is more likely when the individual has access to reference groups or role models who have amalgamated similar identities. I tested some of the propositions using data collected from 269 women sociologists using a mailed questionnaire. I found support for the proposition that individuals have multiple identities to which they are highly committed. I also found that the number and value of relationships linked to an amalgamated identity could be used to predict involvement in behaviors related to the amalgamated identities. However, the relationship between commitment and behavior was not equally strong for all types of identities. Commitment appears to be strongly related to behaviors associated with identities that are both voluntary in nature and flexibly defined. Of the identities I examined, (academic, woman, mother, and feminist), commitment and behavior were most strongly related for the identity of feminist. This difference between more and less voluntary identities may provide an important key for understanding why previous tests of Identity Theory have had only weak to moderate success in predicting behavior.",

      "abstract": "Humans share social skills with other primates, but at the same time they possess cognitive capacities that make them unique as a social species. One explanation that could be advanced is that language and verbal communication might play an important role in differentiating humans from other primates (Tomasello 1999; Dunbar 1993, 1996). Different arguments have been provided to explain how language intervenes as supporting species-specific social skills. One is that language could have an important role as a bonding mechanism. The approach here is based on Robin Dunbar's (1993) claim that language is a bonding process related to social group formation. Language as a bonding mechanism contributes to the extension of group size. The paper provides a language-based interpretation of social networks conceived as a complementary approach to the one propounded by Dunbar. Another claim is added to Dunbar's argument by considering the fact that language must generate social ties and networks if it is to increase group size. The main argument is that language creates virtual networks by projecting social ties as public representations available to be reported and assessed (Livet and Nef 2009).",

      "abstract": "Because of Moroccan municipalities are still unable to integrate sophisticated communication approaches characterized by the capacity to bring the citizen closer, in accordance with the laws in force, to the environments of public management, the e-communication relating to logistics inside local authorities is nowadays a crucial issue of the Moroccan municipalities management. However, the logistics e-communication of Moroccan local authorities presents an antinomy since it is characterized by an illusion at the theoretical level, despite its quantitative outcome in the literature. Singularly addressed in research in France, Asia and America, it is almost absent as a research field in the great African space, where it becomes more illuminated as a field of social and professional practices. However, several acts show the still perplexing attribute of its status, as well as its doubts about the theoretical and practical answers to be given to the current divergences of territories (cities, municipalities, regions, etc.). Because of the incessant questions about the logistics communication dimensions (rank, obstacles, challenges, etc.), it seems necessary to us to question the bases of a possible crisis in the evolution of the field of Territorial Logistics Communication (TLC) in Morocco in order to better open up to the panoramas of the latter in the e-communication vision. Therefore, based on a theoretical study, we first offer a brief overview on the fragmented terminology of territorial logistics e-communication. Then, we try to bring out some features specific to the problem of the logistic e-communication of the territorial collectivities in the Moroccan space, before proposing, finally, a model to well illustrate the logistic e-communication inside Moroccan territorial collectivities and to support the management Moroccan local spaces.",

      "title": "Planning tactics of undefined becoming",
      "abstract": "Introduction: ontological deliberationsThe planning idea of undefi ned becoming arose from the augmented conviction that present-day reality has become so complex, fragmented, multidimensional, diffused, alinear and volatile that it is hard -if not impossible -for planners to set predefi ned, concrete, long-term goals; such as for the sake of society, humanity or some kind of moral standards (Boelens, 2000(Boelens, , 2006 ) ). Modernistic planning, which was in essence the ambition to 'propose communal, democratic solutions for a specifi c space, based on a long vision on time' has been fi nally criticized to its very core (Lyotard, 1979 ;Harvey, 1989 ;Boelens, 1990 ).However, the alternatives -such as critical rational or procedural (Faludi, 1986 ), communicative (Innes, 1995 ) or collaborative (Healey, 1997 ) planning approaches -also remain more or less framed within this kind of epistemology.The latter still focus on predefi ned goals, albeit trying to reach those along alternative cyclical, participatory or adaptive planning routes.Although these kinds of approaches are still useful for specifi c kinds of planning questions (see also below), there is a need to become stauncher and more steadfast when it comes to complexity; especially while these situations become more and more apparent for planning too.There is indeed a growing need to navigate in an ocean of changing settings and contingent possibilities (Hillier, 2007 ).Nevertheless most planners still set some strategic points at the horizon in this ocean of change.This becomes even more prominent in the work of Louis Albrechts ( 2012 , 2015 ) and others, who time and again stick tenaciously to the idea of strategic planning, whereby planners set the course, democratically in cooperation with others of course, trying to keep the strategic targets over time, if necessary in subsequent phases, through several sub-stations of ex ante , in-between and ex post evaluations, and/or by implementing it co-productively with various stake-and shareholders.In that respect, planning of undefi ned becoming takes a more radical course.It goes beyond the idea of a (modernistic, procedural, communicative, collaborative or co-productive) plan.It works from within, or from the outside-in , instead of the usual (administrative planning-oriented)",

L'autore evidenzia la necessità da parte delle discipline psicologiche di utilizzare un linguaggio comprensibile per interloquire a livello politico, istituzionale e amministrativo, nell'intento di perseguire un interesse comune, tenendo conto dei bisogni in termini comunitari e promuovendo interventi di ampio respiro, che interconnettano campi disciplinari apparentemente distanti (es. salute mentale, economia, demografia…).",

Researchers are engaged in the same way as the other actors in deconstructing and constructing possible knowledge. As for outcomes, it seems less important to obtain the formulated objectives and carry out the desired changes than to carry out the social action that produces knowledge about the modes of knowledge of the social in those who inhabit society itself. This constitutes unexpected effects and discoveries with a social impact that should not be underestimated, in particular in relation to the weighty questions that are raised about possible forms of integration in our post-modern society.",

      "title": "The Use of Empathy in Human Services: Strategies for Diverse Professional Roles",
      "abstract": "The human service profession is characterized a broad and varied field that draws on many disciplines in order to meet the diverse needs of individuals, groups, and communities (National Organization of Human Services [NOHS], 2009). These needs can include limited access to services, mental health concerns and challenges, and unemployment. To effectively respond to these needs, human service professionals are required to fulfill many roles including, but not limited to, direct service worker, advocate, administrator, and evaluator (Neukrug, 2013). Regardless of the role assumed by the human service professional, the ability to demonstrate basic empathy is required to effectively provide services to a wide variety of populations in diverse settings. Therefore, this article provides an overview of empathy, describes the human services roles of direct service worker, advocate, administrator, and evaluator, and explores empathy an effective tool in service delivery. Overview of Empathy The concept of empathy has existed for centuries. However, it was not until the 1900's that the definition of empathy was used to describe the process of connecting with another's experience in the context of mental health treatment (Clark, 2004; Feller & Cottone, 2003; Pigman, 1995). Carl Rogers was pivotal in establishing empathy a core condition of the therapeutic process (Clark, 2004; Rogers, 1957), describing it in the following way: To sense the client's private world it were your own, but without ever losing the as if quality-this is empathy, and this seems essential to therapy. To sense the client's anger, fear, or confusion it were your own, yet without your own anger, fear, or confusion getting bound up in it. (p. 99) Another conceptualization of empathic communication portrays it a continuum of basic, additive, and subtractive responses (Carkhuff, 1969; Ivey, Ivey, & Zalaquett, 2010). Through basic empathy, the helping professional accurately reflects the content of the client's message and conveys a sense of understanding. In contrast, subtractive empathy, which is seen unhelpful to the relationship building process, occurs when the helping professional's response does not address or capture the content of the client's message. Additive empathy involves reflecting content beyond the level the client was able to communicate, capturing deeper meanings and/or broader themes. This form of response, accurate, can help clients achieve new insights and may facilitate movement towards new ways of thinking about issues (Carkhuff, 1969; Neukrug, Bayne, Dean-Nganga, & Pusateri, in press). The benefits of empathy have been well documented within research on counseling and the therapeutic process. Empathy is oftentimes regarded the cornerstone of the therapeutic process among mental health professionals, it facilitates the building of rapport and a strong therapeutic alliance (Clark, 2010; Corey, 2005; Elliott, Bohart, Watson, & Greenberg, 2011; Feller & Cottone, 2003; Glauser & Bozarth, 2001; Hartley, 1995; Lux, 2010; Neukrug, 2011; Rogers, 1957; Sinclair & Monk, 2005). When empathy is a part of the client-clinician relationship in a therapeutic setting, clients report benefits above and beyond traditional modalities. For example, empathy was found to be a moderately strong predictor of positive therapeutic outcomes such reduced client distress, client satisfaction, and positive outcomes in group therapy settings (Elliott et al., 2011). In addition, the integration of empathy has been found to reduce client anxiety and is related to client's ownership of personal change (Angus & Kagan, 2009). Though these conceptualizations of empathy are helpful, the application of empathy in the human service field is often different from traditional counseling and psychotherapy in that human service professionals are not usually focused on therapeutic change in clients. …",

      "abstract": "Social isolation can be defined as a state in which an individual experiences less social engagement with others than they would prefer, and that interferes with their quality of life. Social isolation can happen at any point during the life span; however, social isolation among older adults often presents gradually due to specific life transitions and life events. Although older age is often cited as a main characteristic of social isolation, research has demonstrated that older age does not have a universal negative influence on social connectedness (Cornwell, Schumm, Laumann, Kim, & Kim, 2014). Factors associated with social isolation vary, and can include retirement, poor health, change in socioeconomic status, or the loss of a friend or family member (Bekhet & Zauszniewski, 2012). Research also identifies living alone, having a small social network, and infrequent participation in social activities as risk factors for social isolation among older adults (Cornwell & Waite, 2009).",

      "title": "Digital Communication in and Beyond Organizations—A Path to Hyperinclusion",
      "abstract": "Digital communication technologies allow organizational members to work independent from time and space (cf. Khan and Agha, 14(4):103–114, 2013: 16). Using this new freedom carefully is advisable, since new expectations on availability may develop interactively (cf. Entschew and Suchanek, 2017: 312; Sydow et al., 2009: 700). The potential development of a self-reinforcing impulse of accelerated communication and an implicit availability demand may lead to a new organizational norm of permanent availability (cf. Entschew and Suchanek, 2017: 312–313; Menz, 2017: 22). This issue became more relevant than ever due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, more and more people work from home using digital communication technologies. For some organizational members, compliance with such demands implies inter-role conflicts since it collides with other commitments (e.g., family responsibilities, community work, recreation, hobbies and leisure). Inter-role conflicts (organizational role vs. family role vs. community role vs. recreational role etc.) occur if there are role expectations placed upon a human such that compliance with one role makes compliance with the other role difficult (cf. Katz and Kahn, 1978/1966: 204). A problem occurs if an organization becomes greedy and (implicitly) requests undivided commitment of its organizational members (cf. Coser, 1974: 4–7). Powerful leaders may drive this: '[…] if the leader gets greedy, demanding the same level of urgency every day, the energy will fizzle and performance will sink, despite employees' heroics' (Bruch and Menges, 2010: 6). Organizational members potentially become hyperincluded. Hyperinclusion describes the main determination of one's life through one institution demanding (excessive) role expectations (cf. Erfurt Sandhu, 2014: 176, 188). Accordingly, all other roles of one's life comply with these (work) demands (e.g., one's residence, selection of friends, leisure activities). Due to the (potential) development of such scenario, the recommendation of this paper is to institutionalize training on digital literacy as well as on moral discernment in organizations. Training managers and employees to responsibly deal with new freedom through digital communication allows sustainably making use of the advantages, which these technologies offer.",

One set of special conditions places restrictions on parolees’ social relationships and associations, which can include general restrictions (e.g., non-association with individuals involved in crime) or specific restrictions (e.g., no contact with one’s victim or co-accused). Drawing on case files of women under community supervision ( n = 43), we explore how non-association and no contact orders shape community release experiences. We suggest that such conditions can have wide-reaching effects on women’s social lives and reintegration (e.g., in the areas of social support, employment, and housing), thereby, at times, complicating women’s attempts to construct post-institutional lives and identities. We consider how association conditions illustrate the broader tension between parole requirements and reintegration.",

      "abstract": "Although Lithuanian population is aging and the number of older persons is increasing, the expectancy of autonomous life is one of the shortest in Europe. An increasing number of the elderly results not only in aging society, but in increasing morbidity as well. Reality of life is encouraging health care systems to take into account the needs of older patients and to seek for comprehensive assessment, which is not limited by physical assessment only but includes evaluation of functional state, cognition, socioeconomic status, home environment, identification of geriatric syndromes and vulnerability factors, and assessment of frailty. The term \"frailty\" is used to describe the status of the elderly person who can usually perform the main practical and social daily tasks, but due to loss of various functions, changes, or disorders cannot restore quickly the strength. Concomitant diseases, disorders, disability, and frailty were considered as synonyms, but the researchers have recently agreed that these terms are not the same. The social part of supportive environment is composed of people (family, friends, professional caregivers) who provide help. The physical part includes technologies that make living easier and more autonomous. Gerontechnologies in vulnerable and frail elderly people can compensate impaired orientation and memory, widen the possibility to communicate, exchange information, and move. With the help of gerontechnologies, safe home environment and monitoring of health state can be ensured. In the article, algorithm for maintenance of autonomy in older persons made by the authors is presented.",

      "abstract": "According to the general emphasis of pragmatic realism in science as human activity and the role of objectivity, prediction in the social sciences, like economics, and in the sciences of the artificial, like the sciences of the Internet, cannot be seen as if it were a mere intellectual exercise of knowledge, but rather it should be oriented towards relevant issues. These could be regarding a) the validity of the theories available (which is very important in the case of economics), b) the reliability of the practical solutions to specific problems, or c) the large amount of variability in the application of the tested scientific solutions. Within this context of pragmatic realism, the evaluation of the axis of the proposal - scientific realism around activity and objectivity - comes from how scientific prediction deals with complexity, both structural and dynamic. This is crucial in the case of prediction of the social sciences, where complexity is in the social world (particularly, in economics) at different levels (micro, meso, and macro: individuals and groups, organizations and markets, governments and international institutions). In addition, it is decisive for the sciences of the artificial, which enlarge human possibilities based on predictions of the viability of the aims of the designs, as can be seen in the sciences of the Internet. The test of the dealings of prediction in these sciences with complexity should reinforce the need for objectivity while developing the scientific activity in the three spheres indicated: basic science, applied science, and application of science.",

It starts from the following question: what notions qualify the variety of meanings attributed to practices linked to the expression social enterprise? The notion of social enterprise derives from the questioning about the limits of exclusively economic, monetary-based initiatives, regarding the capacity to respond to social demands, it represents, to a certain extent, the resurgence of experiences that mobilize varied purposes between economic and social logic. However, the extension of the notion of social enterprises in the world has been open to different and even conflicting interpretations, between an Anglo-Saxon version, a classic European version and a Latin American and a renewed European version (Laville, Young &amp; Eynaud, 2014). It is under such bias that the term may occur, in different contexts, as social business, third sector, social economy or solidarity economy, as we have pointed out here.",

      "title": "Potentials of participatory approaches for urban mental health",
      "abstract": "Abstract Aspects of mental health, society, space and environment share entangled relations being studied in health geography. Recreational spaces as well as places that are commonly perceived as strenuous, unsafe, or highly stressful are unevenly distributed within urban areas, which is also associated with spatial differences in mental disorders. Spaces in general represent social constructions that reflect power inequalities; they are filled with subjective emotional resonances and sometimes visualize stigmatization of specific groups. As such, the interplay of socio-demographic factors, socio-economic factors and built environment is complex. To capture these entanglements represented in heterogeneous user groups, participatory approaches promise valuable insights. Yet, despite their great potential for fostering mental health in urban space, participatory approaches are still less common in health geography. Therefore, critical voices question whether the limitations of marginalized groups have been sufficiently considered in this field of study so far. Similar challenges arise in urban planning processes: Specific (vulnerable) groups such as children, women, foreign residents, and people with disabilities or elderly people are insufficiently included in planning processes, leading to an underrepresentation of their needs in the resulting environments. To tackle this shortcoming, the approach of co-creation offers a process in which participants jointly develop a solution without being the object of research or interview partners, but creators. Using rather practical or creative (e.g., joint mapping of the built environment, photo-elicitation) than discursive techniques allows contributions from population groups otherwise often excluded from planning processes. Despite certain limitations, participatory approaches promise the possibility to develop appropriate and just solutions in urban mental health.",

In the frame of this handbook on youth sport, the transition stage from youth to\nadulthood will be addressed in more detail. Studies on sports participation among youngsters\nare often restricted to traditionally organized sport, defined alike structured and competitive,\nludic forms of physical activity that typically take place in a club (Coakley, 2008; McPherson\net al., 1989). However, sociological research on sports participation shows an increasing share\nof informal modalities for organizing sporting practice, which do not fit with such a traditional\napproach (e.g. Eime et al., 2013; Pilgaard, 2012; Scheerder and van Bottenburg, 2010). In\nparticular, the transition from adolescence to adulthood comes along with changes in daily \nlife patterns of young people, such as entering university, creating new social networks, leaving\nthe parental environment or starting to work, where youngsters have to make decisions\nregarding conflicting time-occupations. Therefore, it is likely that this new stage relates to changes\nin values and logics in the experience of leisure-time activities like sport and physical exercise,\nand may lead to a decreasing interest in club-organized activities (Balish et al., 2014; Jakobsson\net al., 2012; Pilgaard, 2013). This chapter investigates which organizational settings 15-25-yearold youngsters engage with in practising sport. Youth will be divided into two groups:1 adolescents (aged 15-18 years); and\n2 young adults (aged 19-25 years).",

      "title": "Gasto público y exigibilidad de los derechos sociales en tiempos de crisis",
      "abstract": "espanolUna aproximacion a la sostenibilidad de los derechos sociales supone, cuando menos, poner en conexion la metodologia juridica y la economica y, por tanto, utilizar un enfoque multidisciplinar. Ahora bien, la entrada en escena de los derechos sociales como atributos fundamentales del ser humano o, en otros terminos, como elementos inherentes a la dignidad de la persona, impide analizar la vigencia de las normas sobre derechos sociales en funcion de una mera prevision o equilibrio cuantitativos de la relacion costos-beneficios. En efecto, la efectividad de los derechos sociales nos traslada a un terreno en el que ese binomio inseparable (costos-beneficios) se muestra menos rigido, reciproco o sinalagmatico, lo cual se perfila meridiano en el caso de las prestaciones sociales no contributivas. Evidentemente, en tales supuestos, el bienestar social es trasunto de un beneficio en terminos cualitativos (verbigracia, como fundamento del orden politico y de la paz social) que, como es logico, no admite una operacion matematica compensatoria. En la adopcion de cualquier medida de solidaridad, ayuda, apoyo o cohesion social, ya tenga como destinatarios a personas concretas, ya vaya dirigida a zonas o regiones particulares, deben tenerse en mente de manera conjunta las ventajas cualitativas y cuantitativas. A titulo de ejemplo, las clausulas de salida o exclusion (opt out clauses) relativas a instrumentos normativos europeos de derechos sociales, o las pretensiones de reciprocidad cuantitativa en las contribuciones estatales a la construccion de un espacio comun europeo, son dificilmente asumibles y hacen caso omiso de las contrapartidas cualitativas . Por otro lado, la sostenibilidad de los derechos sociales no debe quedar al albur de las promesas politico-economicas (de la mera direccion politica de la economia), sino que debe confrontarse con los mecanismos de exigibilidad juridica. En otros terminos, las cifras sobre dinero destinado al goce efectivo de los derechos sociales no tienen que ser un simple acopio estadistico utilizado a conveniencia por los politicos; antes bien, deben configurarse como elementos de prueba susceptibles de ser utilizados por las instancias judiciales o cuasijudiciales para propiciar la exigibilidad y eventual justiciabilidad de tales derechos, o sea, su plena efectividad. EnglishAn approach to the sustainability of social rights at least means to bring online legal and economic methodology and using a multidisciplinary approach. However, the arrival on the scene of social rights as fundamental attributes of human beings (as inherent dignity elements) do not allow analyzing the effect of the rules on social rights based on mere prediction or quantitative balance of the cost-benefit relationship. Indeed, the effectiveness of social rights takes us to a land where that inseparable (cost-benefit) shows less rigid, reciprocal or mutually binding. That is crystal-clear defined in the case of non-contributory benefits. Obviously, in such cases, the social welfare is, in terms of quality, a transcript of a benefit (as for instance, as the foundation of political order and social peace) obviously, it does not support a compensatory math. Furthermore, the sustainability of social rights should not be left to the political and economic promises (from mere political direction of the economy), but it must confront the enforceability mechanisms. In other words, the figures on money for the enjoyment of social rights need not be a simple statistical gathering used by political convenience, but rather, it must be configured as evidence that can be used by the courts or quasi-judicial to encourage the eventual enforcement and justice of such rights. That is, their full effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study explores how middle-class Quiteños respond to certain convivial directives among family and friends that they are unable or unwilling to comply with. It examines some of the strategies which Quiteños employ to deal with the tensions that can arise from two conflicting forces: social pressure and individual wants. Close ties among family members and intimate friends often make refusals to certain directives difficult, so that people feel obliged to comply because of el compromiso (social) (i.e., the obligation that relations of kin or friendship impose). On the other hand, when there is less closeness, token acceptances and avoidance strategies may be employed for face-saving purposes. Both sets of behavior (compliance and non-compliance) are interpreted in terms of the underlying interpersonal ideology of connectedness (Fitch 1998) that seems to operate in Quiteño society. Within this ideology, relationships can take precedence over the individual's o .wn desires; if however, the bonds are less strong, people find ways of responding to social pressure without actually acting contrary to their own wishes.",

Empowerment is directed so that they can help themselves, or efforts to guide the community so that they consciously learn to lead themselves, solve their own problems, according to their own potential and the potential of existing local resources.

      "abstract": "The results of the survey indicate the growing significance of the term online leadership and group cohesion in the field of hr – management of enterprises in the construction industry, there are cases of gaps in digital professional communications that arise in everyday work, especially in specific conditions (autonomous remote work in conditions of a pandemic, forced emigration during martial law from Ukraine). Working groups or project groups cooperate in professional groups (labor teams). It is shown that the socio-economic efficiency of work of professional groups (productivity, etc.) is directly dependent on the level of group cohesion. Passive personnel and motivation policy, professional development of employees is not fully realized; management pays more attention to business and profit than to caring for subordinates; lack of socio-psychological analysis of the workforce; low/weak coefficients of group dynamics; indicators of employee satisfaction with work are below average, there are cases of conflicts between team members, a feeling of \"internal liberation\". In the conditions (pandemic covid-19, martial law), stress processes were activated, which can cause maladaptation to working life. Possible forms of knowledge management at enterprises in the construction industry: investing in professional development: training, retraining or upgrading the qualifications of employees; providing opportunities for non-formal education, self-management; encouraging participation in corporate trainings for personal growth, dedicated to, for example, effective business communication, mastering time management skills, which will allow employees to free up more time for acquiring new knowledge and participating in the exchange program; training in digital development programs offered by the Ministry of Digital Transformation through educational series and automated testing. Along with professional skills programs, the formation and effectiveness of social development plans to ensure harmonious group dynamics and functional communications is important.",

Or do teachers need to be supported by a range or mix of awareness, tools, bodies and apparatus which are essential elements in the process? In order to offer real opportunities of promotion and exercise of intercultural competence it is indeed necessary to adopt an interactional and ecological perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1986), that seeks the global conditions favoring change as it is neither possible nor sufficient to provide an individual response to a systemic problem. This article reflects on the urgent need to establish/implement adequate services, procedures and rules to help make school an environment in which the sense of belonging, the personal empowerment and the exercise of active citizenship are encouraged and incentivized. &nbsp",

These can include tensions between the following: doing what a commitment to research requires or serving policymakers; prioritizing basic inquiry or promoting applied research; having a primary concern with producing knowledge versus an immediate and urgent commitment to practical improvement in the world. These dilemmas are probably intrinsic to the position of social research in modern societies, but they are becoming more severe at the present time. It is argued that, in dealing with them, we should be clear about the distinctive character of research, as against other related activities; and must recognize its heterogeneity, identifying the dimensions that differentiate its legitimate forms.",

Det peger på behovet for, at der skal der satses på solide professionskompetencer, der gør praktikere i stand til at opøve en faglig dømmekraft i svære konkrete praksissituationer, da arbejdet både er konkret, situationelt og foregår indenfor en bestemt kontekst.",

      "abstract": "Theory of social representation by S. Moscovici (1984) provides\na comprehensive background that explains how common (social)\ncommunicative structures are generated, shared and used in\neveryday life. We can see the SR as a social system with\nrelatively stable core. The central core gives a social\nrepresentation its meaning. We can find it and name it as a\nusually bipolar dimension or rather as a set of dimensions.\nPeripheral elements are organized around the central core and\nthey constitute an interface between the core and actual\nsituation Since the individual experience beyond a discourse\nraises tension, the social representations, which set up in the\ncourse of dialogical communication, restore comprehensibleness\nof actions in the group (see Markova, 2003). We can expect that\nboth the core and the periphery influence human representation\nand action, but they participate differently under different\nconditions. We can theorize that the roles of certain\nperipheral parts of social representations become more\nimportant in such situations, which are highly familiar and\nrelevant to both the individual and his informal group. We\nexpect that real life experience-based communication is more\npowerful to bring real variability into (peripheral) SRs and\nconsequently also to the core SR. There were three groups of\nresearch subjects - classmates (65 altogether), aged from 16 to\n17. Every class-group came from different grammar schools in\nthe city of Brno. There were not any interactions among\nparticipants during examination. The participants were asked to\nsolve two problem situations. The first situation showed a\nperson (man/woman) lying on a street, who may be in a need of\nhelp. The second situation presented a person (man/woman)\nwanting to get a job that is very important for her/him. Our\nresults support the assumption that the core of social\nrepresentations and their peripheries participate on individual\nrepresentations differently, depending on both subjective\nfamiliarity and in-group familiarity of the situation. The\ncommunication of common experience, obtained within familiar\nand relevant situations, takes the thematisation away from the\ngeneral core of social representations and introduces\nvariability to their periphery.",

      "abstract": "Identity construction is a dynamic process that encompasses a variety of factors such as commonalities, loyalties, power struggles, and survival instincts (Lei, 2003). The complex dimensions of Black identity are influenced, in part, by community, comfort, and acceptance which at times imposes fixed categorizations, characteristics, and singular depictions. Recent research suggests that more attention be paid to the needs of Black adolescent girls and how their race and gender impact what happens in schools (Koonce, 2012). Moreover, it challenges and influences academic success, as it is challenging and difficult to excel in environments that fail to value every aspect of one's identity or identities (Rollock, 2007).Black girls' interaction with each other, especially in urban schools, can also be problematic and resemble “relational aggression,” when in fact it is a form of posturing to increase their social status. Contextual factors (e.g., culture, school climate) can serve as risk or protective factors for involvement in posturing, relationship aggression, or increasing one's social status. Research focused on peer relationships has found differences in friendship patterns among ethnically and socioeconomically diverse youth, suggesting the importance of examining friendships within the context of ethnic and socioeconomic diversity (see Brown, Way, & Duff, 1999; Crothers, Field, & Kolbert, 2005). Sisterhood among Black girls can serve as a supportive network that enhances the “Black girl experience” as well as promote wellness and healthy identity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Several societal and social biases have conspired to make the study of language maintenance and language shift more advanced than the study of reversing language shift (RLS). RLS efforts have been confused with messianic (i.e. irrational) and past‐oriented (i.e. nativistic) movements, overlooking their rational, priority setting and modernising dirust. Even diose engaged in the study or practice of RLS, however, have tended to lack theoretical coherence and to be mesmerised by 'activism' rather than by the empirical relationship between any particular RLS efforts and die demonstrable intergenerational transmissibility of language‐imbedded behaviours, attitudes and beliefs. Where bilingualism with diglossia is all that can be realistically attained, RLS emphases must concentrate on family‐neighbourhood‐community building boundary‐setting efforts. Where largely monolingual cultural autonomy becomes realistically possible, more inter‐group confrontation RLS efforts should be undertaken, but their link to intergenerational transmissibility still requires explicit attention. (Post‐)modernisation poses serious new RLS problems for the family‐neighbourhood‐community, and the school as well, makingit imperative for RLS efforts to be incentive‐related far above and beyond their initial language‐in‐society (Xmen‐widi‐Xish) ideals.",

      "abstract": "Despite a significant role of a society’s economic culture and a worker’s personality in the life of the society, an enterprise or another person, the problem of forming economic culture is underdeveloped in pedagogic and economic literature. It is still not clear how the processes of forming an individual’s basic economic culture and a specialist’s professional education in the conditions of continuous economic education are interconnected. Low effectiveness of a person who is not economically educated is underestimated. The process of a person’s economic culture growth causes significant problems as it appears to be a complex integrated phenomenon characterizing the manufacturing and entrepreneurial activities (the most important values accepted by the society members; dominating ethical standards of economic activity; the code of behavior; the system of formal and informal norms of economic activity; rituals, customs and traditions, individual and community interests; the level of the company consciousness and management, the manager’s organizing and administrative activity; availability and high quality of company’s basic and business documents; state-of-the-art office equipment, etc.). The economic component is a part of each block of requirements to the specialist and as a consequence is not an independent direction. However, its formation cannot be reached by a single learning discipline or a course of disciplines, but requires a system approach. The move to the market economy, the integration into the international educational space, the processes of democratization and humanization of the society life have required the Russian system of education to respond to a whole range of demands: to make the process of the specialist’s preparation for life and the specialist him/herself more flexible, able to respond to the changes in social processes; to adapt the graduates to the market relationships, which depend on the occupation level and the level of proposition in a work sphere; to ensure the flexibility of education which will facilitate a more comprehensive realization of a person’s creative potential.",

      "abstract": "Building agreement and influencing public opinion need effective communication. As a means of expressing ideas, language creates emotions that are used for political advantages during an electoral campaign. Human existence and the maintenance of connections depend on communication, a complex process. In actuality, human interactions are lubricated by this substance. Despite its importance, communication has two sides and can be applied either favorably or unfavorably. From the standpoint of its capacity for complexity, Boulton (2019, p. 41) pointed to the negative social intent of language. She also noted that language is frequently employed to deceive rather than to communicate. Human existence and the maintenance of connections depend on communication, a complex process.

More broadly, as the increase in antisocial behavior over the last decades indicates, we have lost our commitment to values we all share and next to no new ones have arisen to replace those that were lost.We should not treat violence, drug abuse, illegitimacy, promiscuity, abusive attitudes towards people of different backgrounds, alcoholism, poor academic performance, and other social maladies as isolated phenomena. They reflect several social factors but key among them is weakness of character, the inability to resist temptation and adhere to pro-social values.Communitarians maintain that values do not fly on their own wings. To shore up our moral foundations attention must be paid to the social institutions that undergird our values. These include the family, schools, the community (including voluntary associations and places of worship) and society (as a community of communities).",

      "title": "RETHINKING SELFIES: EMPOWERING THE MARGINALIZED THROUGH SELF-PORTRAITS",
      "abstract": "More than just a self-taken, static photo shared on social networking sites, selfies are considered nonverbal, visual communication that implies one’s thoughts, intentions, emotions, desires, and aesthetics captured by facial expressions, body language, and visual art elements. Previous studies have investigated selfies in light of adolescent development (e.g., how teenagers use selfies to seek attention; see McLean, 2014) and prestigious user groups (e.g., celebrities’ self-promotion; see Wallop, 2013). Although these studies generalize selfies as a relation between narcissism and public attention, between (re)construction of self-esteem and optimized (or selective) self-presentation, and between self-promotion and social capital, selfies are produced and experienced by people in sociocultural terms. It is difficult to understand selfies without taking into account the deeper sociocultural context in which they were created, used, and interpreted (e.g., in a non-Western culture). What happens, then, when selfies, as “fashionable” sociotechnical artifacts, are introduced to and adopted within user groups of sociocultural specificity, such as marginalized groups? We draw on a six-month ethnography performed by the first author, including user observations and 56 in-depth and semi-structured interviews in the favelas of Vitoria, Brazil, to study slum residents’ selfie practices. The fieldwork focused on four Community Technology Centers (CTCs): two LAN houses (Life Games in Itarare and Guetto in Gurigica) and two Telecenters (one in Itarare and one in Sao Benedito). We used ethnography to emphasize how marginalized people experience and understand selfies, which puts them at the center of the research and posits that people themselves define their valued lives. We argue that practices of understanding, interpreting, and experiencing selfies are embedded in dense sociocultural contexts. For marginalized users who are suffering in a relatively severe living environment, selfies are not a shallow way to show narcissism, fashion, and self-promotion and seek attention; selfies, rather, empower the users to exercise free speech, practice self-reflection, express spiritual purity, improve literacy skills, and form strong interpersonal connections. This research contributes to a growing social scientific literature on selfies by rethinking selfies as empowerment and fostering a non-Western and nonconventional mode of knowing on people’s daily use of technology. This approach sheds light on the role of technology in various dimensions in people’s lives.",

      "abstract": "Socialization is regarded as a process of integration of an individual in the society, various types of social communities (a group, a social institution, a social organization) by acquiring the elements of culture, social norms and values, which serve as the basis for forming the socially critical personal features. It could happen under the chaotic influence of social circumstances on the individual as well as by means of nurture (purposeful personality formation). Socialization is exercised by way of an individual acquiring social experience and acting on it in their activity. As the result of integration, an individual acquires the stereotypical behavioral norms and values of the social environment he is operating in. Under the modern conditions various mass media play a crucial role in the process of personality formation, thus, such institutions as family and educational establishments should aim to curb the influence of the television and internet websites on the formation of personality. Social environment, as a combination of social and psychological conditions, which an individual lives and faces on a regular basis, has critical impact on their development. Therefore, it iscrucial to skillfully use the potential of the environment in the process of bringing up a personality.",

Indeed, it is beginning toseem possible that even aspects of human societies which at ﬁrst seem entirely remotefrom computer work may be studied by computer simulation, for example, the muchdebated and argued notion of ‘ideology’.It should be emphasized that the aim of such work is NOT, as might at ﬁrst be supposed, tocreate the most ‘realistic’ artiﬁcial society possible. Such an approach inevitably leads tooverwhelming complexity. Worse it is scientiﬁcally naive.

A sample of psychologists and anthropologists from all parts of the world was asked to respond to a questionnaire the way they believe an individualist and a collectivist would respond. The questionnaire described 10 target persons in seven situations. The responses converged, suggesting that there is consensus about the meaning of the dimension. Accordingly, collectivism can be defined as (1) concern by a person about the effects of actions or decisions on others, (2) sharing of material benefits, (3) sharing of nonmaterial resources, (4) willingness of the person to accept the opinions and views of others, (5) concern about self-presentation and loss of face, (6) belief in the correspondence of own outcomes with the outcomes of others, and (7) feeling of involvement in and contribution to the lives of others. Individualists show less concern, sharing, and so on than collectivists. The approach can be used with other relatively unstudied constructs to establish whether there is consensus among researchers about the meaning of a construct.",

In this sense, organizations involve patterns of relationships beyond primary group associations that are largely spontaneous, unplanned, and informal, and that are typified by kinship relations, peer groups, and localized community networks. There is, however, no generally accepted definition of an organization since its meaning may vary in terms of the different sociological approaches applied to the subject. Moreover, while organizations may be deliberately constructed or reconstructed for specific ends, the problem of definition founders on the specification of “organizational goals,” since groups and individuals within organizations may hold a variety of different and competing goals and the level of compliance and cooperation displayed by subordinates may vary, thus leading to the distinction between “formal” and “informal” organizations.",

      "title": "Sociolinguistic Typology: Social Determinants of Linguistic Complexity by Peter Trudgill",
      "abstract": "Reviewed by: Sociolinguistic Typology: Social Determinants of Linguistic Complexity by Peter Trudgill Jeffrey Heath Sociolinguistic Typology: Social Determinants of Linguistic Complexity. Peter Trudgill. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011. Pp. xxxviii + 236. $35.00 (paper). Trudgill's argument is that \"complexity\" (a dubious term, see below) of a language Lx correlates, statistically though not absolutely, with five factors whose values also tend to cluster into two poles: • high versus low contact with other languages, measured by the extent of adult outsiders acquiring Lx as second language (pp. 16, 34, 99); • unstable versus stable social situation of the Lx-speaking community over time (pp. 3, 9); • large versus small Lx-speaking community (pp. 99-100); • weak versus strong (dense or multiplex) networks within the Lx-speaking community (p. 104); • low versus high extent of communally shared information (p. 127). [End Page 404] The definition of high versus low contact is carefully constructed, excluding various types of situations that for other purposes could be considered as high contact. By Trudgill's definition Lx is not in a high contact situation when its own speakers also speak a national language or lingua franca, even though this may lead to extensive borrowing. Nor is it in a high contact situation when there is recurrent intermarriage with speakers of another low-population language, so that child bilingualism is dominant. The only situation that meets his definition of high contact is when large numbers of adult outsiders learn to speak Lx imperfectly. One polar type has high contact, an unstable social situation, a large community, weak networks, and low communally shared information. This syndrome, characteristic of most standard national languages but also of creoles, strongly favors (and perhaps compels) simplification or the maintenance of inherited simplicity. The other polar type has low contact, a stable situation, a small community, strong (dense) networks, and broad sharing of information. This is the small-scale language community, isolated by geography, by an absence of in-migration, or by both, and it allows (but need not compel) complexification or the maintenance of inherited complexity. I refer to these below as the \"standard/creole\" and \"relic\" social situations, for lack of better terms. At the end of the book, mixed types based on differing values for the first three criteria above are recognized (p. 147). This is probably the most thoughtful and knowledgeable articulation of a growing movement reacting against the all-languages-are-the-same model (\"equicomplexity\" [p. 51]) that one associates not only with typologically uninformed bioprogrammers but also with many defenders of the dignity of minority languages or dialects, especially creolists (such as Michel DeGraff) and social dialectologists (such as Trudgill's mentor William Labov). Trudgill sticks to morphology and phonology. The morphology chapters deal with four types of complexity and complexification (pp. 21-22, 62): categorial load (presence versus absence of nonuniversal categories), irregularity versus regularity, opacity versus transparency, and degree of redundancy. Categorial load (my term) corresponds to what Trudgill calls at first \"paradigmatic redundancy\" and later, more perspicuously, \"addition of morphological categories\" (pp. 22, 62). On the other hand, we might merge irregularity-regularity with opacity-transparency, which overlap considerably. Leaving aside these terminological quibbles, the bottom line is that high load, irregularity, opacity, and extensive redundancy can develop in relic situations (e.g., the Northwest Coast of North America, the Caucasus, New Guinea, Australia). Standard/ creole situations strongly favor developments in the opposite direction. The phonology chapters focus on phoneme inventories and to some extent on the presence or absence of unusual sound shifts. Aside from sheer phoneme count, Trudgill is also interested in the geometry of vowel systems: standard/creole situations require feature symmetry and maximal dispersion (acoustic clarity at the expense of articulatory effort), while relic situations allow tighter systems that may include typologically marked front rounded vowels, and that present reduced acoustic dispersion. Correlations of social situation with phoneme count leads to a conundrum: standard/ creole situations require a middling range (enough for basic communication but not much more), while relic situations allow anything from luxuriant proliferations of phonemes (Caucasus, Northwest Coast) to extremely compressed, bare-bones systems (Hawaiian, to which we can now add Pirah...",

Sports tourists travel for many reasons. In sports tourism, satisfaction of needs is found within five distinct activity categories — events, tours, resorts, attractions and cruises. Travel decisions are made not only for extrinsic motives suc as temporary escapism, feelings, desire for involvement but also for extrinsic reasons — rewards, recognition, prestige. The “weight” given to each or combined motive, either positive or negative, influences the basic motivational interplay to be found within the sports travel dynamics. Further, intrinsic influences affecting the decisions making process could be chanagable and marginal factors dealing with health condition, discretionary monies, age demographics and the like. There also is a distinction between “intangibility” of services that cannot be sensed, felt or touched and the non‐standardizaation of services that fluctuate with consumer demands, requirements and expectations. [Taylor — p. 92] The former intangible services are difficult to evaluate; the latter are quite tangible. Furthermore, travel distances to familiar or unfamiliar destinations are overriding and respectfully conducive to meaning, interest and drives. The preceding model illustrates the motivational interplay found in sports travellers decision making process. The “perponderance” and the complexity of motives, incentives and reasons viewed by the sports tourist hang in the balance of ACTION and INACTION.",

We argue that social identity is an important factor; therefore, agents should incorporate social identity theory in their behaviour, which implies the ability to categorize others (and themselves) into social groups. In addition, social situations often present social dilemmas with expected rational choices. Social identity may influence the agent to deviate from the rational choice. However, in some situations the rational choice may be the expected, and believable, behaviour. In fact, we argue that finding the dynamics between the social bias induced by social identity and the rational motivation is one of the challenges of building believable agents. In all this, anticipation takes an important role, as it is important to understand the others to cope well with a social situation.",

      "abstract": "Summary It is possible to tackle exclusion by altering the nature of transactions between individuals and groups, including mental health services. One way to do this is to cultivate ‘social capital’ or interdependence between individuals and groups – as well as giving, each is entitled, but not compelled, to claim something in return. It is difficult, if not impossible, to sustain stigma and social exclusion when people are meeting mutual needs, building trust and helping each other. Mental health providers can foster social capital by creating community cohesion, namely interdependent relationships between individuals and organisations. This approach has been put into practice in the USA, where providers assert that small investments in building social capital return many times the cost. In the UK there is evidence that community development can make a contribution to mental health but it does not fit well with conventional approaches to mental health services – it calls for different skills and a vision that is collective rather than individualised.",

Whether issue is war, poverty, pollution or curriculum change, students are coming to consider it both their right and their responsibility to speak out on those concerns which touch their personal and social lives. Efforts to convert their views into social action, however, are leaving many of them frustrated. This is due in part to a feeling among ait least some of young that they are powerless in face of an unresponsive and uncaring society. Powerlessness, a principal component of alienation, is defined by .Seeman as the expectancy or probability held by individual that his own behavior cannot determine occurrence of outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks.1 The root cause of powerlessness condition lies in an alienating social order. Advancing technology, accelerating social change, increasing bureaucratization and a complex maitrix of other social forces, argue social scientists (e.g., Mills,2 Nisbet,3 and Blauner4), are serving to fragment, disorient, and diminish contemporary man, thereby alienating him from very social systems he himself has created.

Wicked problems call for an integrated approach to negotiate common understanding as a problem unfolds so that responses are acceptable to different social groups whose interests might conflict (Carlile et al, 2013).

      "title": "Interaksi Sosial Pekerja Seks Komersial dengan Masyarakat Setempat di Lokalisasi Gang Sadar Kawasan Wisata Baturraden Kabupaten Banyumas",
      "abstract": "Pola interaksi sosial dalam masyarakat sekitar lokalisasi begitu tertutup dan terbatas dalam jumlah pelakunya. Hal ini lebih dikarenakan oleh profesi mereka sebagai PSK, merupakan profesi yang sulit diterima nasyarakat pada umumnya. Sehingga interaksi yang terjadi hanya berlangsung pada PSK, mamih papih, orang setempat yang berdomisili di dalam kawasan lokalisasi, dan para pelanggan yang membutuhkan “jasa” mereka (PSK). Lokalisasi adalah penetapan dan pembatasan daerah tertentu; penyediaan tempat prostitusi, tempat pelacuran. Tetapi di sisi lain, keberadaan lokalisasi juga membawa dampak positif bagi sektor ekonomi masyarakat yang berdomisili di sekitar lokalisasi dan juga dampak negatif dalam kehidupan sosial masyarakat, khususnya dalam kehidupan keluarga. Pelacuran atau prostitusi merupakan salah satu bentuk penyakit masyarakat yang harus diminimalisir penyebarannya tanpa mengabaikan usaha pencegahannya. Permasalahan pelacuran ini meningkat seiring dengan adanya perubahan tata nilai, pranata sosial, arus informasi serta dampak krisis ekonomi yang berkepanjangan. Dampak yang paling merugikan yang ditimbulkan dari pelacuran sangat kompleks, yaitu merusak sendi-sendi moral, susila, hukum dan agama, rentan terhadap gangguan Kamtibmas (keamanan dan ketertiban masyarakat) serta penyebaran penyakit menular seksual dan HIV/AIDS.\r\nPermasalahan yang dikaji dalam penelitian ini adalah: (1) Bagaimana bentuk interaksi sosial yang terjadi antara Pekerja Seks Komersial dengan masyarakat setempat, (2) Apa saja faktor-faktor yang mendorong dan menghambat interaksi sosial antara Pekerja Seks Komersial dengan masyarakat setempat, dan (3) Bagaimana dampak yang ditimbulkan dari proses interaksi sosial tersebut terhadap kondisi sosial dan ekonomi masyarakat setempat. Penelitian ini bertujuan (1) Untuk mengetahui bentuk interaksi sosial yang terjadi antara pekerja seks komersial dengan masyarakat setempat. (2) Untuk mengetahui faktor-faktor mendorong dan menghambat interaksi sosial antara Pekerja Seks Komersial dengan masyarakat setempat, dan (3) Untuk mengetahui pengaruh proses interaksi sosial terhadap kondisi sosial dan ekonomi masyarakat setempat.\r\n\tMetode penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif. Penelitian ini di lakukan di Desa Krangmangu Kecamatan Baturraden Kabupaten Banyumas. Subjek penelitian adalah Pekerja Seks Komersial dan masyarakat setempat yang tinggal di kawasan lokalisasi yang terkait langsung maupun tidak langsung dengan keberadaan lokalisasi Gang Sadar dengan melakukan wawancara pada beberapa orang yang dianggap representatif dan dapat memberikan informasi yang sesuai dengan yang diinginkan. Alat pengumpul data dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan melakukan wawancara, observasi dan dokumentasi. Data yang diperoleh dianalisis dengan teknik deskriptif yang dilakukan dengan cara triangulasi. Triangulasi yang digunakan dengan membandingkan data yang diperoleh peneliti lewat pengamatan dengan data hasil wawancara, serta membandingkan hasil wawancara dengan isi status dokumen yang berkaitan.\r\n\tHasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa Interaksi sosial yang terjadi antara PSK dengan masyarakat setempat sangat beragam. Interaksi antar sesama PSK terjadi hubungan sosial yang baik, para PSK menjalankan tugas dan peran masing-masing sehingga tidak pernah terjadi bentrok atau keributan antara PSK. Dalam berinteraksi dengan orang tua asuh terjalin suatu hubungan yang begitu akrab antara PSK dengan bapak-ibu asuh (mamih), mereka seperti satu ikatan keluarga. Untuk interaksi dengan pengunjung biasanya terjadi dari awal kedatangan tamu (pelanggan). Interaksi sosial yang terjadi antara PSK dengan warga sekitar lokalisasi memunculkan dua bentuk interaksi yaitu interaksi asosiatif dan interaksi disosiatif. Faktor yang mendorong terjadinya interaksi sosial antara PSK dengan masyarakat setempat dari segi internal antara lain: (1) adanya rasa saling hormat-menghormati antara PSK dengan masyarakat setempat, (2) adanya pembinaan yang dilakukan oleh masyarakat setempat dengan pihak paguyuban Gang Sadar. Faktor yang menghambat terjadinya interaksi sosial antar PSK dengan masyarakat setempat dari segi internal antara lain: (1) adanya rasa takut, canggung, malu, atau perasaan dikucilkan dari PSK menjadikan terhambatnya interaksi sosial dengan masyarakat setempat, (2) kesibukan dalam menjalankan tugas masing-masing menjadi salah satu penghambat interaksi sosial. Keberadaan lokalisasi membawa dampak positif dan dampak negatif yang dapat dirasakan oleh masyarakat setempat. Dampak negatifnya adalah rasa khawatir dan takut kalau ada anggota keluarganya terjerumus dalam dunia prostitusi dan tertular penyakit kelamin seperti HIV/AIDS. Dampak positif dapat dirasakan dari sisi ekonomi, dengan adanya lokalisasi memberikan peluang usaha bagi masyarakat setempat.\r\nSaran yang diajukan dalam penelitian ini sebagai berikut: Pihak pemerintah daerah perlu melakukan tindakan preventif dan represif dalam menangani masalah prostitusi agar tidak semakin meluas. Usaha preventif diwujudkan dalam kegiatan untuk mencegah terjadinya pelacuran, misalnya penyempurnaan perundang-undangan mengenai larangan atau pengaturan penyelengaraan pelacuran. Usaha represif merupakan kegiatan untuk menekan (menghapuskan, menindas) pelacuran, misalnya melalui aktivitas rehabilitasi agar mereka bisa dikembalikan sebagai warga masyarakat yang susila. Pihak lokalisasi perlu mengadakan kegiatan sosial yang melibatkan para PSK dan masyarakat sekitar agar terjalin hubungan yang baik. Masyarakat diharapkan untuk bisa menerima kehadiran para PSK dengan tangan terbuka apabila para mereka ingin kembali kedalam kehidupan yang normal seperti manusia lainnya. Para PSK harus lebih banyak berinteraksi dengan warga dalam kegiatan sosial agar tercipta kerukunan hidup.",

Mutual aid, one of group work's primary principles, coincides with the social work value of the importance of human relationships. Groups offer many opportunities for healing and are a regular component of social work practice. There are some ethical challenges that are distinctive to group work, while other challenges can arise in all methods of practice. Ethical challenges can ensue when group facilitators do not recognize cultural diversity or the route/context of members to the group. G. Wood and R. Middleman point to the need for social workers to attain insight into organizational function. If this insight is deficient, the possibility of ethical challenges increases. Whilst ethical practice in group work is an iterative process and will evolve based on context and time, the need for research and revision keep the power of groups alive.",

Social evolution is generating a demand for greater mobility and thus the solution of mobility problems may be found either in further changes in social need or in new ways of meeting that need. Currently, attempts to meet the demand for mobility are tending to increase the economic, social and physical distances between the affluent and the deprived. Additionally, forecasting methods for future mobility situations are not sufficiently sensitive to social factors likely to be significant. The situation is further aggravated by existing institutional systems failing to proportionately represent different social values, and failing to equitably distribute social costs and benefits.",

      "abstract": "The promise of agent-based for explicating properties of social systems has not yet been fully realized. Agent models sometimes provide only a veneer of, rather than substantive engagement with, social behavior. The problem will be illustrated with Axelrod’s model for evolution of ethnocentrism (a biological model) versus Schelling’s model for spatial segregation based on preferences (a cultural model). The examples show the need to incorporate both the biological and cultural basis for behavior through a schema that includes behavior based on cultural/cognitive processing of information and behavior based on biological/cognitive processing of information. An example of an agent-based model that implements decision making in this manner is discussed. The model accounts for heterogeneity in behavior outcomes and leads to two main predictions: (1) small scale, hunter-gatherer societies in resource scarce environments will have stable adaptations less affected by variation in resource abundance in comparison to groups in resource rich regions where inter-group conflict is more likely and (2) the relationship between community size, population size and administrative complexity will have two distinct patterns, one for patrilineally organized societies and the other for matrilineally organized societies. Both predictions have been verified empirically.",

What are the norms by which the facilitators of communication shape their role? Is there indeed only one role for the community interpreter or are there several? Is community interpreting aimed at facilitating communication, empowering individuals by giving them a voice or, in wider terms, at redressing the power balance in society? In this volume scholars and practitioners from different countries address these questions, offering a representative sample of ongoing research into community interpreting in the Western world, of interest to all who have a stake in this form of interpreting. The opening chapter establishes the wider contextual and theoretical framework for the debate. It is followed by a section dealing with codes and standards and then moves on to explore the interpreter’s role in various different settings: courts and police, healthcare, schools, occupational settings and social services.",

Thus, the following will address itself to some of the relationships between the two: (1) the occurrence of failure in sport and reactions to it, and (2) the social organization of sport; specifically professional sport, and particularly baseball and to a lesser degree, football, as such variable organization conditions failurereactions in these contexts.",

      "title": "Transfer and Social Practice.",
      "abstract": "This paper examines knowledge transfer from cognitive and sociocultural perspectives. It is held that transfer is not from the general to the specific or vice versa, neither is it wholly from the disembedded to the embedded. Rather, transfer is the process of disembedding knowledge from one situation and transforming it to have utility in another, which includes finding analogies which ease transfer. Consequently, expectations of and understanding about transfer across different types of social practice (e.g. the classroom and workplace) may be based on incomplete assumptions. It is proposed that vocational knowledge has its genesis in different levels of social development, each with its own characteristics and potential for transfer. In current vocational curriculum frameworks, goals for vocational education often relate to the disembedded sociocultural level of knowledge, yet there is an expectation of that knowledge being transferable across communities of practice, such as workplaces with their own sets of embedded norms and values. Yet, not only are these communities distinct, but that transfer is from one type of community of practice to another (e.g. a workplace to a .particular classroom). This makes the prospect of transfer across different kinds of settings 'far' (transfer to circumstances which are novel), something which does not readily happen. This may help explain the paucity of transfer between two different communities of practice - the 'classroom' and the workplace. The paper concludes by discussing approaches to instruction for maximising transfer across settings and circumstances, which emphasise the need to embed and disembed knowledge as well as seeking to construct analogous opportunities for transfer.",

      "title": "Measuring attitudes and feelings towards discrimination in cross-nation research: lessons learned from the European Social Survey",
      "abstract": "The dimensions that may be heuristically distinguished in the concept of “discrimination” include motivation, discriminatory action, effects of discrimination, the relation between motivation and action, the relation between action and effects, the immediate organisational (institutional) context, and the larger societal context (Feagan & Eckberg, 1980: 2). Although any proposal of the measurement of discrimination on the labour market should ideally cover all these dimensions, this is clearly impossible within the limits of this study. We have confined ourselves to the measurement of discrimination in the first round of the European Social Survey. This means that our focus is exclusively on verbal expressions of discrimination in general, and if possible, discrimination related to the allocation of jobs. This is a first limitation of our study. We are conscious of the complexity and the multitude of problems that are encountered in the measurement of the behavioural aspect of discrimination at the different levels mentioned because of i.e. the social undesirable and often illegal character of this kind of behaviour. However, since our focus is on the attitudinal aspect of discrimination, these problems are largely avoided. It is incorrect to assume that the response to a verbal question in a questionnaire necessarily reveals an attitude which would become operative in the situation depicted in the question (Linn, 1965: 353) as we all know from the classical study of Lapierre (1934). This does however not mean that the study of verbal behaviour is meaningless. Robert Merton has pointed out that it should not be assumed that overt behaviour is",

Starting from a broad definition that avoids reducing participation to formally institutionalized forms, this chapter aims at analysing different practices of young people in public spaces in relation to the tension of representation and conflict: how are these practices structured by whom and what they do represent, by their recognition as legitimate (or not) and whether the social inclusion of their participants is conflictual (or not)? After a theoretical conceptualization between representation and social conflict, two exemplary cases of formal and informal youth participation are presented. In both cases, young people negotiate representation and conflict yet in different ways. This reveals that on the one hand, youth participation can be found in situations of social conflict while facilitating youth participation needs to take dilemmas of representation and conflict into account.",

      "title": "Toi Derricotte's Language as Action: The Construction of Individual and Collective Identity",
      "abstract": "At the still point of the turning world, the job of the artist is not to resolve or beautify, but to hold complexities, to see and make clear. -Toi Derricotte, Tender As the pope repeatedly apologizes for his comments about those who act according to religious precepts not his own, or as citizens worldwide argue about whether George Bush's phrase axis of evil continues to inspire the death of thousands of innocent people at the hands of suicide bombers, day by day it becomes more apparent that modern citizens live in a world or worlds made (and unmade) by language. Susan Miller was right when she worked through poet and philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (language is use), as well as poet and rhetorician Kenneth Burke (there are motives and relationships generic to all [hu]mankind), to conclude that language (or genre) is social action (Miller 1984,162). meanings of language involve what Wittgenstein calls language games, or forms of life, which involve rules people share and sometimes do not. These games give rise to different interpretive strategies in different contexts that, in turn, invite reading communities, communities of interest, shared sites of action, agendas, and shared symbolic practices by different readers and writers who use language as action to create worlds they share-and sometimes don't-with others. By pairing the word genre, an ancient Greek term for habitas or habitation, with stanza, the Italian term for room, poets create worlds out of language, the life forms or shared sites of action that readers identify as poetry. And this act by poets of creating worlds-or nations-in language has been tied, since the inception of human expression, with a pairing of the seemingly unlike through metaphor, a crucial tool of language for sharing and revealing the recurrent patterns of human life. Metaphor's marriage of seeming opposites is often used to portray the interrelationships of the many permeable boundaries or portals of human existence that beg to be entered or crossed-love and hate, war and peace, freedom and bondage, life and death, past and present, the private and public, the personal and the political. And the of course, can be interpreted as one of many language games or forms of life within that larger social or communal nexus in which a citizen moves from the singular T to the plural we, the private to public, to act out common concerns. When feminists shared the cry The personal is political, its future interpretations could not be predicted, nor how the words might variously inspire action: a gay man working as an active soldier in the war on AIDS; a teenage woman at the turn of the twenty-first century watching her feminist role models on Desperate Housewives or Dancing with the Stars; a black woman writer who must wage a constant battle for that self-evident truth of equality and shared we that the framers of the Declaration of Independence, this country's birth certificate, managed to get so wrong. Walt Whitman, Adrienne Rich, and Toi Derricotte all engage in the enormous project of using both poetry and rhetoric (all available means of persuasion) to try to get it right. All employ language as action to help create a nation or nations-to chart an American landscape-in which all citizens equitably can reside. They use different symbolic practices to embody the creative and collective voice, to lay bare the nation's most tender underbelly of inclusivity, the country's most problematic, personal, and plural pronoun we. Both women poets, from different marginalized groups, perhaps most important, have moved beyond Whitman's self-absorption, his Song of Myself, to find some lingua franca of inclusion (Rich 1991, 15). This move is ever more crucial as the United States is touted as a model or promise for transnationalism. In Trans-national (1916), Randolph Bourne already had exploded the myth and metaphor of the country as a melting pot and defined transnationalism as a cosmopolitan federation of national colonies, of foreign cultures, which only can come when no national colony within our America feels that is it being discriminated against or that its cultural case is being prejudged (1739, 1740). …",

      "abstract": "Social innovation is once more an increasingly popular notion circulating as an apparent means to solve the Grand Challenges of the 21st Century. But this common-sense idea of social innovation is based on a quasi-concept, where processes of innovation are absent. To restore some academic rigour to this important concept, we argue more attention need be paid to these innovation processes in social innovation, and that there is value in using innovation concepts drawn from other areas of innovation studies (disruptive innovation, innovation systems, institutional innovation and socio-technical transitions) in highlighting how small-scale social experiments can ultimately lead to the solution of pressing societal problems. Through a subtle critique of the current policy conception of social innovation, it is possible for Innovation Studies in general, and the Eu-SPRI Forum in particular, to help provide better insights into social innovation processes and ultimately to lead to better support frameworks and interventions for promoting solutions to these Grand Challenges.",

Its value as a concept that is different from poverty, with universal relevance, has since been debated. It is used in Western literature about international development, and some authors have linked it to the notion of capabilities. However, it is not widely used in the social work vocabulary. Conversely, the notion of social inclusion has gained in usage and application. This links with values that underlie promotion of empowerment and participation, whether of individuals, groups, or communities. Both terms are inextricably linked to the realities of inequalities within and between societies and to the principles of human rights and social justice that feature in the international definition of social work.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Corporations are increasingly engaging in corporate social advocacy (CSA) by communicating on social issues that are controversial and contemporary and not necessarily linked to the corporations' business activities. The purpose of this study is to understand the desirability of CSA: Should corporations be communicating on these debated social issues, and to what extent? Using the online sampling platform Qualtrics, participants ( N = 699, located in the United States and 18–35 years old) responded to a survey asking them how they perceived corporate communication on debated social issues. Findings indicate that participants view corporate communication on debated social issues as something that corporations should be engaging in, that this communication is helpful in solving these debated social issues, and that corporations should be the leaders in changing how society thinks about these debated social issues. At the same time, individuals do not trust the moral compass of corporations. Findings also show that certain corporate sectors (e.g., Health Care) should communicate more than other sectors (e.g., Chemicals), certain corporate characteristics (e.g., Reputation) matter more than other corporate characteristics (e.g., Size), and certain topics (e.g., Race Relations) should be discussed more than other topics (e.g., Confederate Flag Use).

The spatial units can be larger cities (mainly neighborhoods), medium‐sized cities, small towns, or villages. The subjects of investigation are social groups, institutions, and organizations from the local context, whereby typically it is being asked what relationships, social orders, thoughts, actions, or lifestyles are established within and among them, and how they are realigning. Community studies pursues the goal of analyzing macrosocial processes paradigmatically, in miniature, and among circumscribed local groups, in the context of their specific theoretical interests, and in times of social change – for example during processes of urbanization, industrialization, and modernization. In terms of methodology, this field is characterized mostly by ethnographic research designs. This does not exclude the possibility that community studies would not require extensive participatory observation. However, in each case community studies is characterized by complex multimethod approaches.",

      "abstract": "The quality of life is an immediate sustainability manifestation, which refers to the capability of the place or the local community to meet the current needs of the citizens without jeopardizing the possibility for the future generation to meet their needs to the full extent. The quality of life is the identification of the key domains of human well-being in the community, ie., the identification of the existing needs of its citizens. The needs of the citizens of one local community synthetize everything that the citizens recognize as a difference between the current and desirable situation. The need can be formulated also as a wish to improve the current situation or to correct the defect.\r\nSystems (services, institutions, agencies) for providing services to the citizens in the functional communities base their activities on defined priorities of the local community, they reduce the potential risks for the citizens, put their focus on outcomes (changes among citizens) rather than the processes themselves, maintain existing and establish new social networks of help and support to individuals, while respecting their individual rights, include citizens (service users) in decision-making agencies, and others. Whenever various forms of community action and action are realized, into account must be taken the specificities of the target groups and the characteristics of the community whose needs or deficits must be met. Based on these principles a modern police organization is basing its activities within community policing, dealing primarily with the security needs of citizens.\r\n            The analytical approach in this paper deals with the implementation of a problem-solving strategy with the goal to reduce the fear of crime and the rate of crime, that is, with the measures and activities by which the police influences on the quality of life of citizens in the local community.",

Such intercultural contact results in both cultural and psychological changes. At the cultural level, collective activities and social institutions become altered, and at the psychological level, there are changes in an individual's daily behavioral repertoire and sometimes in experienced stress. The two most common research findings at the individual level are that there are large variations in how people acculturate and in how well they adapt to this process. Variations in ways of acculturating have become known by the terms integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization. Two variations in adaptation have been identified, involving psychological well-being and sociocultural competence. One important finding is that there are relationships between how individuals acculturate and how well they adapt: Often those who integrate (defined as being engaged in both their heritage culture and in the larger society) are better adapted than those who acculturate by orienting themselves to one or the other culture (by way of assimilation or separation) or to neither culture (marginalization). Implications of these findings for policy and program development and for future research are presented.",

      "abstract": "The official and politically correct language of the educational world consistently insists on the importance of learning to think during the period of formal and compulsory education. Returning to a basic principle of political life, possibly as old as mankind but more clearly declared in forms of democratic organization, we cannot understand a democracy without the existence of an educated and informed citizenry, able to think for itself in confrontation with options and world conceptions different from its own. Intelligence - understood as the ability of people to develop abstract thinking and reasoning, to understand complex ideas, solve problems and overcome obstacles, learn from experience and adapt to the environment - is the most valuable attribute that we have. Reasoning well, therefore, is essential to all human beings, both in relation to their personal lives and in the relations we have living in society. Despite this, there are several mistakes that we make when thinking, when we make decisions or solve problems, both in our everyday lives and in decisions about social and political issues of a general nature. So it is necessary to improve our ability to reason in general, with emphasis on formal and informal reasoning. This improvement is a fundamental goal of education, although in practice it has not received enough attention. In order to achieve this, the implementation of programs of learning to think are required, including the Philosophy for Children program, which involves one of the most solid and consistent proposals on this subject. The program uses the Western philosophical tradition, focusing on the quality of the arguments during discussions of the classical themes of philosophy, all considered within the framework of the school converted into a community of inquiry.",

This engagement is often motivated by a need to innovate economically as well as harness diverse ideas and skills not possible to access internally. What is also becoming evident is that managing such relationships so that they endure and produce value is challenging for organizations. Organizations are used to directing efforts and coordinating tasks by either using hierarchical control or entering into enforceable contracts. However, with collectives of volunteer (often unknown) contributors or loosely coupled ecosystem players neither of these mechanisms is likely to work. Moreover, organizations often engage these new forms of organizing when they are looking for innovative ideas, which require not only coordinating tasks, but also enabling collaboration across boundaries. This is usually achieved through the development of shared knowledge capabilities (language, culture, practices) in organizations. It is not clear how these can be emulated in the new environment.

      "title": "Diversity Competence: Cultures don’t meet, people do by Edwin Hoffman and Arjan Verdooren. Bussum: Uitgeverij Coutinho. 2018 (352 pages) ISBN: 978-90-4690598-2",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Edwin Hoffman and Arjan Verdooren’s book, DiversityCompetence, tackles the many confusions operating between people from different cultural and/or ethnic backgrounds. Their book − a comprehensive toolbox examining many aspects of intercultural communication − features a great wealth of examples, some of which are very humorous indeed. DiversityCompetence would be a useful resource for (mental) health workers, managers, trainers, teachers and students with Western, non-Western or migration backgrounds who are faced with clients or team members from different cultural, ethnic, educational and class backgrounds. Key concepts Hoffman and Verdooren unpack how feelings of confusion often get in the way of positive intercultural interaction, when the behaviour of ‘the other’ is considered strange (p. 20). Normalising this strangeness is challenging because of the complexity of cultures. Other factors such as the current circumstances, social position and personal characteristics of those seeking to communicate are easily overlooked too in analysing communication. People are always members of different groups with different cultures that change continuously. Because of this complexity Hoffman and Verdooren prefer to use the term ‘diversity competence’ rather than ‘intercultural competence’. This competence requires consciousness and openness to experiencing strangeness which occurs ‘when someone from another group behaves or reacts in a way that is somehow unknown, strange or unexpected’ (p. 52). Strangeness can be experienced as a threat and result in hostility and defensive responses. Hofman and Verdooren write that normalising strangeness ‘is creating a situation in which these differences can be safely investigated, negotiated and explored’ (p. 64) to enable a constructive mutual dialogue to take place. The authors have adapted Watzlawick’s interhuman communication analysis (Watzlawick et al., 1974), adding a third element of ‘common sense or social representations’ to his axiom of ‘content and relationship’. They state, ‘Common sense is a system of thinking, social practices and communication that characterises a particular group. (It constitutes) a worldview of assumptions such as what is true and false, what is good and bad, what is right and wrong and what is normal and abnormal’ (p. 120). It is created in communities in a social dialogue (p. 120). A really great resource in the book is their tool, ‘TOPOI’,1TOPOI: singular ‘topos’: Greek for ‘place’. intended as a ‘…framework to assist reflection during or after an encounter’ (p. 127). The basic reasoning is as follows: Intercultural communication is interpersonal communication; cultures do not meet, people do. People are persons, group members and humans. At all these levels, they interact during communication. TOPOI, an acronym for ‘tongue, order, persons, organisation and intentions’, represents five interconnected areas in which intercultural miscommunication may occur. TONGUE relates to a person’s verbal and non-verbal language, meanings and interpretations. ORDER relates to a person’s views and logic, concerning the issues at hand. PERSONS relate to how a person views himself or herself, the other and the mutual relationship between them. ORGANISATION relate to the organisational and societal context. INTENTIONS relates to a person’s underlying motives, emotions, values, needs and desires (appeal). For each area, the following core reflections are used: What is my share? What do I do? What do I say that makes the other person act in this way? What is the other person’s share that makes me act in this way? What is the influence of the social contexts (common senses) making the other person and myself act in this way? Hoffman and Verdooren have also produced a set of practical study materials with assignments, case discussions and analysis cards to help readers and students to improve their diversity competence, available online at https://www.coutinho.nl/diversitycompetence/study-material/topoi-cards.html PERSONAL REFLECTION I have worked in global contexts for several decades as a trainer and teacher (Haans, Lansen, & Ten Brummelhuis, 2007) with different target groups in reconstruction regions after manmade and natural disasters. About twenty years ago, knowledge about interculturality was still in its infancy. My experience has been that with a lot of trial and error, students and I have managed to get the sometimes difficult communication going again and again. Just as the subtitle of the book says, ‘Cultures don’t meet, people do’. Intuitively we have felt that it was not only communication errors and postcolonialism that caused distress. There was much more to it. This book in its comprehensive approach helps me greatly in understanding and tackling struggles in my daily practice of diversity. This is applicable, not only to a global setting, but also to a domestic one − in my case, the Dutch context. By constantly paying attention to the social context and to the basic needs of all people, diversity competence transcends the micro level of interpersonal relationships. I recommend this book to you.",

Things that encourage the emergence of conflict and integration is the existence of similarities and differences of social interests . In every social life there is not a single human having the exact similarity, whether of ethnicity, interests, will, will, purpose and so on. From each conflict there are some that can be resolved, but some can not be resolved resulting in some acts of violence. Violence is a symptom that can not overcome the root of the conflict, causing violence from the smallest model of violence to war. Good communication is needed in problem solving and is important in achieving the success of a life in the community.Conflicts can be resolved well if communication is harmoniously established between the community, both verbal and non verbal. Effective communication patterns are one of the most important conditions in relation to resolving conflicts among conflict resolution societies that arise in marriage life especially in different national marriages, the subject of education because women and men are distinctly different in terms of communication.

      "title": "Public Identity in Defining the Boundaries of Public and Private: The Example of Latent Anti-Semitism",
      "abstract": "THOSE who study everyday communication know that people evaluate the situation in which they will communicate with their partners before communication actually begins. In this evaluation they primarily determine whether they should follow the rules that govern public or private communication. The act of communication itself occurs through constant reevaluation of the situation , the goal of which is to develop a consensus about the public or private nature of the communication engaged in. Such evaluation of the private or public nature of an interaction is perhaps the most common example of defining the borders of public and private spheres. As researchers dealing with latent public opinion have shown (Angelusz, 1996a), the main factor determining whether opinions are hidden or clearly manifested is the political and social system , mainly through the structure of the public realm. On the one hand, opinions may be hard to identify in the course of research because the members of the society in question do not readily form opinions about relevant subjects. On the other hand, some individuals in society hide their opinions because of “a refined attempt to seek psychological advantage, existential SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 69, No. 1 (Spring 2002) Public Identity in Defining the Boundaries of Public and Private: The Example of Latent Anti-Semitism BY ANDRÁS KOVÁCS dependence, or a fear of the harder social consequences” (Angelusz, 1996a: 21.). Even in advanced democratic societies with well-functioning public realms, racial, religious, and other group prejudices belong in a category of opinions that are often kept hidden because their public expression would amount to an open breach of the consensus rejecting such views. As in the case of any other form of illegitimate public behavior, this would give rise to psychological conflicts and possibly even personal disadvantage . This observation has been verified through empirical research. Research on prejudice—and on anti-Semitism in particular— has revealed a strong latency pressure: respondents consider it risky to express anti-Jewish opinions. For example, in the course of a survey performed in Austria in the summer of 1991, 27 percent of those who took part in the survey avoided providing a response when they were asked whether the number of Jews in influential positions should be limited, while 31 percent refused to take a position on whether a law should regulate the amount of property or land Austrian Jews could obtain (Karmasin, 1992: 31-34). In Germany in 1989, 20 percent of respondents to a survey agreed with the statement, “If I am talking about Jews, I am always very careful, because it is very easy to get your fingers burnt,” while 15 percent stated that “I don’t tell just anybody what I think about Jews” (Bergmann and Erb, 1991b: 280). This same statement was accepted by 25 percent of respondents in a 1993 survey of Hungarian university students, while 52 percent of the same students thought that “if you say something bad about Jews, you are immediately branded an anti-Semite” (Kovács, 1997: 58). Using Luhmann’s definition (Luhmann, 1984: 458), scholars concerned with the problem of latency distinguish between two forms of latency. They speak of conscious or factual latency (people do not have developed opinions about certain issues), and of communicative or functional latency (participants in the communication hide their real opinions) (Bergmann and Erb, 1986, 1991a; Bellers, 1990). Opinions may be concealed in two ways: 180 SOCIAL RESEARCH respondents avoid addressing a problem even though they do hold opinions; or they declare views that are not their real perspective . Two types of motivation may explain why a respondent avoids answering survey questions. It may be that some people really have no developed opinions about the issues raised; the problems of the survey are of no interest to them. But it is also possible that the refusal to give a full answer is a means of hiding opinions. Using Luhmann’s categories, the first group is characterized by factual latency, the second group by communication latency. Gilljam and Granberg call the former “real nonattitudes or true negatives,” and the latter “pseudo-nonattitudes or false negatives” (Gilljam and Granberg, 1993: 349). * As we know, the public expression of racial, religious, or...",

      "abstract": "When individuals trade with strangers, there is a temptation to renege on agreements. If repeated interaction or exogenous enforcement are unavailable, societies often solve this problem via institutions that rely on group, rather than individual, reputation. Groups can employ two mechanisms to uphold reputation that are unavailable to individuals: information sharing and in-group punishment. We design a laboratory experiment to distinguish the roles of these mechanisms when individual reputations are unobservable. Subjects are split into groups and play a trust game with random re-matching, where only the group identity of one's partner is known. Treatments differ by whether information about group members' transactions is shared and whether in-group punishment is possible. We find that information sharing encourages path dependence via group reputation: good (bad) behavior results in greater (fewer) gains from exchange in the future. However, the mere threat of in-group punishment is enough to discourage bad behavior.",

People who are regarded as a ‘social problem’ (the poor, excluded, criminalized, ‘minorities’, etc.) inevitably also become a social science research problem; even if there is no explicit agenda of social control, the knowledge we make about such people contributes to the workings of disciplinary power. Yet when you are actually doing research in the ‘field’, you rarely feel that your informants are powerless, or that you yourself are powerful. On the contrary, you may feel the opposite is true.

However, although there is now wide recognition of the rights of people with intellectual disabilities to be fully integrated into the community, there have been few attempts to examine the impact of deinstitutionalisation on the affective development and social competence of people with mild intellectual disabilities. Although the consensus both here and overseas is that the physical placement of people with intellectual disabilities away from institutions and into the community has been largely beneficial, there is still an acknowledgement that social integration has not been achieved and that many people continue to lead lonely, isolated and socially restricted lives. Therefore, despite the acceptance for many years of the principles of normalisation, social role valorisation and deinstitutionalisation, there is some dissatisfaction with the outcomes, particularly in the area of social integration.",

      "title": "Partner control mechanisms in repeated social interactions",
      "abstract": "Les individus qui interagissent socialement doivent souvent décider entre aider leur prochain, en leur procurant un bénéfice a un possible cout, ou pas. Tandis qu'une paire d'individus s'en sort mieux si les deux s'entraident, un individu peut tirer un bénéfice relatif s'il se décide à ne pas aider tandis que l'autre l'aide. Cette situation crée un dilemme social. Parce que les interactions sociales sont souvent répétées, les individus peuvent conditionner leurs propres actions sur les actions de leur partenaire lors d'interactions passées. Il existe trois mécanismes de contrôle de partenaire qui stabilisent la coopération lors d'interactions répétées entre paires d'individus: la réciprocité positive (la décision d'aider est conditionnée sur l'aide du partenaire lors de l'interaction précédente), la punition, et le changement de partenaire. Mais les conditions sous lesquelles un mécanisme domine sur les autres lorsque les trois mécanismes coévoluent dans une même population sont mal comprises.<br> Un autre point qu'il est important de considérer pour comprendre les interactions sociales est que le comportement exprimé peut aussi dépendre sur l'environnement. Il est probable que le toilettage social chez les primates, par exemple, dépend de la compétition sur les ressources de nourriture. Si la nourriture est concentrée dans l'espace et facilement monopolisée, les individus en haut de la hiérarchie sociale peuvent défendre ces ressources, auquel cas les individus en bas de la hiérarchie doivent les toiletter afin d'être tolérer sur leur territoire et accéder à leur ressource. Afin de comprendre ce comportement, il est nécessaire de comprendre les conditions sous lesquelles le toilettage est échangé contre du toilettage, ou contre la tolérance sur un territoire.<br> Dans cette thèse, je développe et utilise des modèles agents basés pour explorer la coévolution des mécanismes de contrôle de partenaire et l'évolution de patrons de toilettage chez les primates.<br> Dans le premier chapitre, je démontre que dans une population panmictique, plus les interactions sont répétées, plus il est probable que le changement de partenaire soit le mécanisme de contrôle de partenaire dominant. Si les interactions sont restreintes au sein de petits groupes de non-apparentés, alors la punition est le mécanisme le plus probablement favorisé par la sélection. Les conditions pour que la réciprocité positive soit dominante sont moins clairement définies.<br> Dans le deuxième chapitre, j'étudie comment la dispersion limitée chez la progéniture, le recouvrement de génération, et le cout de la complexité influencent la compétitivité de chaque mécanisme de contrôle. Il est démontré que la compétitivité du changement de partenaire est accrue par le recouvrement de génération tandis que celle de la punition est très diminuée par le cout de complexité. De plus, alors que les conditions pour que ces mécanismes de contrôle de partenaire soient dominants s'élargissent avec la structure d'apparentement, les conditions pour que l'aide inconditionnelle domine sur l'aide conditionnelle se restreignent.<br> Dans le troisième chapitre, je développe un modèle d'apprentissage par renforcement pour simuler les interactions de toilettage et l'accès a la nourriture chez les primates. On observe des patrons de toilettage réciproque lorsqu'il n'y pas de compétition pour les ressources, et des patrons de toilettage dirigé vers le haut de l'échelle hiérarchique lorsque la compétition pour les ressources augmente. Il est montré que l'effort dans le toilettage n'augmente pas forcément avec la compétition pour les ressources, et qu'une augmentation d'agressivité amène le toilettage à être plus réciproque.<br> En bref, les comportements sociaux d'entraide dans les milieux naturels sont observés dans une multitude d'interactions sociales répétées. En explorant une gamme variée de conditions, les modèles développés dans cette thèse permettent de mieux comprendre quels mécanismes de contrôle de partenaire sont favorisés par la sélection naturelle. De plus, le modèle du troisième chapitre montre que les patrons de toilettage dépendent de plusieurs paramètres naturels importants., Individuals that interact socially regularly have to make decisions whether to help another individual (provide some payoff benefit, possible at a personal payoff cost) or not. Here, a pair of individuals is best off if both individuals help each other, but a single individual may gain a relative payoff advantage by not helping (defecting) while the partner does choose to help, thus creating a dilemma. Because social interactions are often repeated, individuals can condition the actions they take on the actions taken by their partner in previous rounds of interaction. The so-called partner control mechanisms positive reciprocity (where acts of helping are conditioned on receiving help from the partner), punishment, and partner switching have all been shown to stabilize cooperation in populations where the individuals engage in repeated pairwise interactions. What remains unclear, however, is under which conditions each partner control mechanism will be dominant in a population if the the partner control mechanisms coevolve.<br> Additionally, the expressed behaviour in repeated social interactions may depend on the state of the environment in which the interactions take place. Social grooming in primates is likely to depend on the food competition that the individuals experience. If food is clustered and monopolizable, high ranked individuals may defend food sources, where low ranked individuals then need to groom high ranked ones in order to be tolerated on the food source, resulting in grooming being directed up the hierarchy. However, the conditions that cause grooming to be traded for grooming or grooming to be traded for tolerance have yet to be quantified.<br> In this thesis, I developed several agent-based models in order to investigate both the coevolution of various partner control mechanisms and the grooming patterns in primates.<br> In chapter one, I demonstrated that in a well-mixed population the likelihood of partner switching being the dominant partner control mechanism increases with increasing number of rounds of interaction. Furthermore, if interactions are localized to small groups of unrelated individuals, then punishment is more likely to be favoured by selection compared to the well-mixed case, while the conditions where positive reciprocity is dominant are less clearly defined.<br> In chapter two, I investigated how limited migration of offspring, overlapping generations, and complexity costs affect the competitiveness of each partner control mechanism. It is shown that the relative competitiveness of partner switching is increased due to generational overlap, while punishment is most strongly negatively affected by complexity costs. Additionally, while the conditions where these partner control mechanisms are dominant in the population increases if the population is kin structured, the conditions where unconditional helping is dominant over conditional helping strategies are rather stringent.<br> In chapter three, I developed a reinforcement learning model that simulated grooming and feeding interactions in primates. The model generated patterns of grooming reciprocity in the absence of food competition, while grooming was found to be directed up the hierarchy if individuals compete for food. It is shown that grooming up the hierarchy may not necessarily increase with increasing food competition, and that an increase in aggressiveness causes grooming to become more reciprocal.<br> In summary, helping behaviours occur in a diversity of repeated social interactions in natural populations. By exploring a large range of conditions, the models developed in this thesis provide insights regarding which partner control mechanism is likely to be dominant in a population. In addition, the model from chapter three shows how grooming patterns may depend on a variety of relevant parameters.",

      "title": "Social Determinants of Health: perspective for understanding the relationship between processes of social exclusion and equity in health",
      "abstract": "Determinants of Health (SDH) can provide support for the construction and analysis of responses and coping strategies really effective. The SDH has been understood by World Health Organization (WHO) as the conditions that people are born, grow, live, work and age, and inequalities that manifest in these conditions also create health’s inequalities 1 . Among different conditions that may generate these inequalities, the understanding and addressing the social exclusion that make difficult for specific social groups to participate completely in communitarian and social live, are characterized as one of the priority focus, according to the WHO, in the search for equity in health. There are many theoretical and methodological perspectives when analyzing the social exclusion and its relationship to health. However, it is possible to identify a consensus in literature regarding to the social exclusion as a multidimensional, dynamic and characterized by its relational character. The relational aspect of the exclusion processes is emphasized and characterized as an interaction of unequal power relations of different dimensions (economic, political, social and cultural) and in different levels that include individuals, families, social groups, communities and countries that may culminate in social stratification processes 2 . Thus, the impact of a particular disease, and even the vulnerability to this are related to biological determinants previously established (age, genre, genetic predispositions, etc) interacting to the consequences of the social stratification based on criteria such as genre, ethnicity, economic stratification and age. These processes shape different possibilities of live and access to essential services for the protection and promotion of health, of exposure to circumstances that bring harm to health related problems (biological, social, psychological and economical) to confront these circumstances by individuals and collectivities. In this sense, the perception of social exclusion as a process and not as a state increases the possibilities of understanding by health professionals regarding the nature and cause of the hardships and inequities, contributing to the development of more appropriate and effective approach to these issues. From this conception it is understood that the equity promotion in health crosses by actions about the SHD and requires a political of power redistribution for empowerment promotion to individuals and groups in social disadvantage. In addition to this political process, highly integrated, it is fundamental transformations in the health professional education and work, because, as recommended by the National Health Promotion Policy, it has to extend its services and actions to beyond the institutional walls reaching people and the community in their real-life contexts.",

      "abstract": "An applicant applying for asylum on the basis of membership in a particular social group must produce evidence showing that their particular social group (1) shares an immutable characteristic, (2) is defined with particularity, and (3) is socially distinct. On February 7, 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) clarified its definition of particularity and social distinction in Matter of M-E-V-G-. According to the BIA, particularity defines the “outer limits” of the group’s boundaries. Social distinction requires the particular social group to be “perceived as a group by society.” Despite the BIA’s supposed goal, M E V G has done little to clarify the particular social group standard. This Note argues that a pro se asylum applicant cannot show both particularity and social distinction. If the applicant defines her group too discretely, the group may fail to satisfy the element of social distinction. But, an amorphous particular social group is certain to fail the requirement of particularity. It is unreasonable to expect a pro se applicant to play this game of semantics. Furthermore, social distinction requires the applicant to produce sociological evidence — mostly in the form of expert witnesses. This implicit requirement of sociological evidence prevents pro se applicants from defining a satisfactory particular social group. In order to protect pro se applicants, this Note proposes a system of precedential fact-finding — drawing upon the United Kingdom’s Country Guidance System — to alleviate some of the burdens of particularity and social distinction.",

Demikian juga pelayanan sosial yang ada dan dibutuhkan lebih mengarah kepada pelayanan sosial untuk keluarga dan hubungan antar keluarga. Kesimpulan bahwa permasalahan yang muncul akibat dari perubahan mata pencaharian tidak selamanya dapat diselesaikan oleh masyarakat yang bersangkutan. Pelayanan sosial yang ada hanya dapat menyelesaikan sebagian permasalahan yang dihadapi. Masyarakat masih membutuhkan pelayanan sosial lainnya agar tercapai kondisi yang kondusif.",

      "title": "The role and mission of sociology in modern society",
      "abstract": "The issues of the role and mission of sociology in modern society have not lost their actuality. The pragmatic role of sociology lies in the fact that sociological information is an important feedback tool when making decisions at different levels of management. That is why it is so important for sociologists to follow the norms and professional ethics, which should be reflected in the Ethical Code of Sociologists. The digital society, the transition to which is actively underway, leads to a rethinking of the role of sociology, because appropriate technologies and management methods are required. The means of obtaining sociological information are also undergoing changes. Alternative ways of getting feedback when making certain management decisions are being developed. The role of sociology is increasing, which at present should focus also on the needs of civil society, performing an educational function. The appeal to public sociology, in which one can see the focus on dialogue with society, is becoming increasingly popular. But for various reasons, objective and subjective, sociology as a whole is associated for society with the study of public opinion on various issues and polls related to election ratings. Sociologists themselves are wary of public debates, they do not come to the forefront of public life. The article presents the main reasons that prevent sociology from fulfilling its mission and role in modern society, among which one can highlight the state of domestic sociology is particularly noteworthy; insufficient sociological literacy, and often complete illiteracy of a large part of the population, contributing to the spread of stereotypes, prejudices about the role of sociology, its capabilities, as well as its significance in the processes of functioning and changing social systems. It is concluded that the mission of sociology is to serve society, it is assigned a connecting role between the interests of the population and government, business. Only in this case, its importance in the life of society can increase, thereby, it will contribute to the release from stereotypes, prejudices about its usefulness, as well as increase its role in making various managerial decisions.",

      "title": "Reducing Prejudice and Discrimination",
      "abstract": "Scholars have developed a plethora of approaches to reducing prejudice and discrimination, many of which have been successfully applied in schools, workplaces, and community settings. Research on intergroup contact suggests that contact between members of different groups, particularly when that contact is warm and positive (for example through friendships) reduces negative emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety) and promotes positive emotions (e.g., empathy), results in more positive attitudes toward members of that group. One might expect that, in an increasingly connected world characterized by global mobility and diversity, higher levels of contact would be associated with a significant lessening of prejudice and discrimination. However, critics have pointed out that changes in attitudes at the individual level do not necessarily translate into reduced prejudice and discrimination at a societal level. Moreover, not everyone has the opportunity to engage in meaningful contact with members of other groups, and even when they do, these opportunities are not always capitalized on. One solution to lack of opportunities for contact is to capitalize on “indirect contact.” These are interventions based on the principles of contact, but which do not involve a face-to-face encounter. Extended contact, which refers to knowing in-group members who have out-group friends, and vicarious contact, which involves learning about the positive contact experiences of our fellow group members, for example via the media, online intergroup contact, and imagining intergroup contact, have each been shown to promote more positive intergroup attitudes. Another way to reduce prejudice and discrimination is to change the way people categorize social groups. When people perceive members of their own group and another group to belong to the same overarching group—that is, they hold a common in-group identity—there is evidence of reduced intergroup bias. However, when our group membership is important to us, this may constitute a threat to our identity, and lead to a reactive increase in bias in order to reassert the distinctiveness of our group. One solution to this is to encourage a dual identity, whereby an individual holds both the original group membership and a common in-group identity that encompasses both groups simultaneously. Alternatively, given the many and varied group memberships that individuals hold, social categories become less useful as a way of categorizing people. There is also evidence that taking a multicultural approach, where differences are acknowledged, rather than a color-blind approach, where differences are ignored, is less likely to result in prejudice and discrimination. Finally, there is evidence that teaching people about other groups, and about the biases they hold but perhaps are not aware of, can help to reduce prejudice and discrimination.",

      "abstract": "It is hypothesized that there is a parallel between psychological change in the course of aging and effects of socialization through work, and that therefore such change in partially produced by work experience. In support of this thesis, it is necessary to combine three fields of research: aging, socialization/developmental psychology, and sociology/psychology of work. The life-time dimension of socialization through, work can be specified on three levels: (1) the cumulation over time of every-day (repetitive) work experiences; (2) the age-specific distribution and consequences of substantial changes in the conditions of working (as a result of technical or economic changes); (3) the temporal structure of coping with work (subjective economy of time). It is plausible to assume that the negative effects of socialization through work increase in the second half of the working-life, and that, therefore, the \"middle years\" present a crucial phase in the aging process (albeit with differential impact for the different cohorts).",

      "abstract": "Epistemic communities generally feature groups of agents who create and process knowledge, exchange information and support opinions in a relatively distributed and networked manner. The availability of sizeable datasets describing the in vivo dynamics of a variety of these systems has recently fueled an unprecedented endeavor of quantitative modeling. Science and, more recently, the digital public space (including online media, weblogs, and discussion forums), are typical application fields for this research effort -- focusing on, inter alia, the understanding of knowledge production, social tie formation, information diffusion or, at a more macro scale, of the (possibly self-organizing) emergence of epistemic communities and their global structure.On the whole, knowledge is being produced or manipulated through interactions which also contribute to shape future knowledge creation, which, in turn, influences the evolution of the social fabric; and so on. It is rather difficult to think of actual exceptions to this rule, where the social structure could be considered independently of the distribution of content, and vice versa. Epistemic communities thus host a coevolutionary dynamics between on one side, agents interacting in diverse manners and contributing to the shaping and evolution of, on the other side, a mesh of beliefs or informations. Yet, this coevolution remains rarely taken into account explicitly in the recent quantitative literature aiming at empirically describing these epistemic communities. The state-of-the-art in this regard focuses on two main issues which are generally addressed in an independent manner: the description of content dynamics and the study of social network characteristics and evolution.This contribution will evoke some recent attempts at merging both types of dynamics into coevolutionary modeling frameworks, where social and semantic aspects are being jointly construed, especially through the lens of socio-semantic frameworks, and discuss case studies related to science and the digital public space.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Indonesian people have a tight relation with instant culture. Instant culture is the culture that wants to finish the job quickly, so it will be provided the instant result. A writer needs so many times to apply his/ her idea, but with the existence of this instant culture, they do not need working hard anymore. These plagiarists only need to copy others’ works. This instant culture almost infects all society level. \r\nIn this research, researcher used imitation factor. It was one of the four factors for creating social interaction existence; they are autosuggestion, identification, and sympathetic factor. This was Gabriel Trade’s theory that was stated in DR. W.A. Gerungan 2000:58, it assumed that all of social life exactly based on imitation factor. Imitation factor’s role in social interaction also had the negative sides, when the imitated behavior was wrong or contravened. If all of the wrong behaviors were imitated by people, imitation process was be able to create errors. Moreover, because of the existence imitation process, the habitual of imitate the others’ works would rise without critics, and thinking habit would be obstructed. Plagiarism was one of negative imitative factor, because it was clear that plagiarism was wrong or contravened. Students rather to depend their paper content on the other’s work than did by themselves. Plagiarism behavior had been imitated by many people included students, it made a big mistake in university education sector. \r\nStudents would be lazy to think and they would be hard to leave the plagiarism behavior. The purpose of this examination is to know why the students do the instant culture in finishing their academic final examination and how the effects of the instant culture in finishing academic final assignment for the students themselves. This study is expected to be able to be used theoretically as a confirmation and can be reapplied, also methodologically as information for another researcher for further research. This research was conducted in Faculty of Social and \r\nPolitical Science, UMM, because it was expected to represent students from all of faculties in UMM. \r\nThe kind of research was qualitative, with case study approach. The collecting data techniques were observation, interview, and documentation. For analytical technique, the researcher based on proposition theory. \r\nThe result of this research proved that instant culture behaviors in finishing academic final assignment especially in paper assignments, was still exist. It was proved by some informants’ \r\nconfession and supported by Communication lecturer’s explanation. By the reason that there is no socialization about Plagiarism comprehension, the students still do the plagiarism. Even though there are some reasons why plagiarism still exist, they are: the other’s influences, lazy to do the assignments, there is wrong academic culture in campus.",

Analysis of personal networks allows us to understand the different mechanisms contributing to the involvement of men or women and to observe the success or failure of these mechanisms in encouraging political discussion and participation. It may permit us to detect the causes of gender segregation with respect to participation. This separation emerges from analysis of the different patterns of relational dynamics with respect to the context.

If computers are to interact with humans in that mode (or to analyse what they are doing in it), methods of interpreting the non-verbal signals that they use are critical. It is becoming clear that developing those methods requires databases whose complexity is of a very different order from those that are standard elsewhere. Samples cannot be generated to order, because acting does not reproduce the way features are distributed in spontaneous action. Data collections need to be very large, because there are extensive situational, individual, and cultural differences. It is a very large task to provide annotations that adequately capture the meaning of facial expressions or gestures.

      "abstract": "Sorting into public sector jobs may be motivated not only by the available income but also by other aspects, such as stronger demand for security or for social usefulness. The demand for larger job security - beside other factors - can be the consequence of family circumstances. We have identified several family conditions which increase the probability of sorting into the public sector: the case of single parents; long-term illness, which doesn't make it impossible to work; having a chronically ill child or pair; in case of women having a husband who previously experienced unemployment. In these cases the usual approach of risk-aversion in the literature is not really correct, optimizing family strategies would be much more accurate. In our paper we used volunteering as the proxy for direct social commitment. We show that this motive is important in case of employees working in human services (education, health and social care, culture, etc.); however it is absolutely missing in the public/government administration. The demand for redistribution can be another approach of social responsibility, connected to it through the aversion towards inequalities. The relatively higher demand for redistribution is characteristic only for employees working in the health and social care. We didn't restrict our analysis of volunteering and demand for redistribution to the sphere of employees, we tried to identify the main explanatory factors also for the whole population. Higher age, higher education, higher number of children (up to three), and the smaller settlement size increase the probability of volunteering. Higher income, higher education, higher number of children and the larger settlement size decrease the demand for redistribution, which - in average - is very high in Hungary.",

      "title": "Decision-making in a family configuration through adoption: experiences and situations arising from the socio-demographic profiles and family structures of Spanish adopters in China",
      "abstract": "Theoretical underpinnings Spain constitutes a special case in adoption processes worldwide, for in recent decades not only has it rapidly become one of the largest recipients compared to other countries, but also, and along with Italy, one of the lowest-low-fertility countries [1] (Kohler et al., 2002; Baizan et al., 2003; Delgado et al., 2006 ). Adoptions are presented as the answer to low fertility in the process of family formation. Although infertility (whether voluntary or not) is a common denominator among the motivations outlined in adoption studies, albeit not the only reason, it coexists with many others that may even be combined (Van Den Akker, 2001; Hoksbergen and Laak, 2005; Ocon, 2008; Marre, 2009;  Berastegui, 2010;  Jareno and Rodriguez, 2010; Jociles et al., 2010; Vich, 2012). Accordingly, other motivations are as follows: solidarity with children; the desire to exercise motherhood alone, and conform to social conventions on the use of assisted reproductive technology; considering adoption as an option; the need to boost the couple; the desire to have a bigger family/return to parenting, or form an intercultural family, among others. Nevertheless, few studies have considered the decision-making process itself (Ocon, 2008; Jareno and Rodriguez, 2010), or the significance of the disparity and heterogeneity of family profiles in the nature of the family configuration. The aim of this paper is to analyze the decision-making process in Spanish adoptive families. This study uses the information provided by 15 interviews with families adopting children in China, considering socio-demographic characteristics and family structure as its determinants. Therefore, the main hypothesis is that to the extent that both aspects are different, making the adoption decision will be too. This study seeks to answer the following questions: Is it a consensus decision from the start, or does someone take the initiative? What traits of family members are involved in the decision to adopt? To what extent do different features have varying implications for decision-making? Do different family structures respond to different strategies in decision-making? What is the correspondence between different family profiles and different motivations for adoption? Methodology and sources The methodology used in this research is qualitative, with a semi-structured interview being the main instrument of inquiry. The use of this tool allows developing a particularist approach, focusing on the heterogeneity of the profiles and their relation to different strategies and dynamics of family behavior. Through the development of a non-probability sampling snowball, a sample is used of fifteen families adopting in China. The analytical strategy used consists of a discourse analysis of respondents based on successive readings of in-depth interviews. Findings and conclusions This study’s findings confirm the complexity of the initial decision-making in the adoption process. Overall, it is a consensual decision, but women often take the initiative and, in some cases, disassociate from altruistic considerations. However, we find cases in which the man or both partners are the proponents of adoption, coinciding with problems or risks related to biological parenthood. The paper highlights the limited influence of the “ticking of the biological clock”, as a result of delayed childbearing among women in our sample. We tellingly find women with higher education, embodied in jobs with high income and status, opting for adoption at an early stage; that it to say, it is a decision that is not linked to reproductive health. Likewise, we find a positive relationship between financial and job stability and the decision to adopt, thereby favoring it especially among women. On the other hand, the existence of a couple at the time of the decision only becomes complicated in a case of two-parent families in our sample but, by contrast, its absence in cases of Single Mother by Choice puts a brake on overall maternity, and adoptive motherhood particularly, by delaying them. In terms of family structure, although the sample included few cases of families with pre-adoption biological children, there is a desire for a mixed type of family configuration that links certain integral component preferences for biological paternity, circumstances that, by becoming effective, favor expanding the family through adoption. A highlight is the disparity of results regarding the correlation between family structure and the origin of the broad decision to set up or enlarge the family through adoption. [1] These are countries with a fertility rate of or below 1.3 children per woman, and therefore ones that generate the greatest interest in the academic world.",

      "abstract": "Se riconosciamo il contributo fondamentale giocato dell’azione (spontanea) per funzionamento della citta (ad esempio per l’innovazione, per l’uso della conoscenza dispersa, per il continuo e perpetuo adattamento/miglioramento dello spazio urbano, ecc.), non possiamo pianificare e creare le specifiche configurazioni sociali e spaziali che riteniamo auspicabili (ad esempio per via degli effetti inintenzionali dovuti all’interazione di molteplici azioni o, piu in generale, per i limiti conoscitivi derivati dalla complessita del sistema sociale), ma al massimo possiamo introdurre certe condizioni che cercano di evitare l’emergere di esternalita negative e, al contempo, favoriscono l’evoluzione di (buone e accettabili) configurazioni socio-spaziali emergenti. Tali condizioni riguardano (i) una buona pianificazione della citta pubblica per lo sviluppo di infrastrutture collettive ritenute necessarie, e (ii) buone regole per la citta privata che garantiscono un’ampia flessibilita e abbondanti spazi per l’auto-organizzazione (ovvero regole che sono semplici, aperte, astratte e generali, prevalentemente negative, stabili e facilmente applicabili).\r\nDopo una lunga stagione contraddistinta da una pianificazione urbanistica prevalentemente comprensiva e tecnocratica, alcuni limiti/problemi sono oramai evidenti e possono essere evitati (ad esempio la mancanza di flessibilita all’interno del piano, i costi derivanti da sistemi regolativi complessi, l’impossibilita di prevedere in anticipo future opportunita/necessita mediante piani urbanistici dettagliati). Questo non vuol dire rinnegare l’importanza dell’intervento pubblico nell’indirizzare lo sviluppo urbano ma, piu semplicemente, che alcuni dogmi consolidati durante la seconda parte del XX secolo devono essere rivisti e superati per dare spazio a nuovi approcci.\r\nDa questo punto di vista, l’esperienza sperimentale di Oosterwold, cosi come altri casi della cosiddetta pianificazione organica diffusasi recentemente in Olanda, sono dei validi esempi di come sia possibile ottenere buone configurazioni socio-spaziali anche senza l’ausilio di tradizionali masterplan o mappe di zonizzazione.",

The rules specifying these interactions are executed using only local information, that is, without reference to the global pattern. Thus collective decisions can be made that, at the individual level, require only limited cognitive abilities and partial knowledge of the environment (Camazine et al., 2001; Hemelrijk, 2002). Simple behavioural rules lead to behavioural flexibility of the society depending on its characteristics (e.g. demography, starvation and kinship) and on its environment (e.g. food distribution and presence of competitors).",

      "title": "Some ontological and epistemological challenges",
      "abstract": "Our society is facing major developments and challenges: the growing complexity (rise of new technologies, changes in production processes, crisis of representative democracy, diversity, globalization of culture and the economy), \nincreasing concern about the rapid and uneven course of development, the problems of fragmentation, the ageing of the population in some parts of the world \nand youngsters and woman entering the labour market in other parts, the growing \nconcern and awareness (at all scales, from local to global) about environmental \nissues, the longstanding quest for better coordination (both horizontal and vertical), the re-emphasis on the need for long-term thinking and the aim to return to \na more realistic and effective method. Cases all over the world (but predominantly in the Global North) tell us that traditional planning tools are often insufficient to tackle these problems and challenges and are even unfit to govern \nprocesses of urban/regional transformation. A lot of traditional planning is about \nmaintaining the existing social order rather than challenging and transforming it, \nand it fails to capture the dynamics and tensions of relations coexisting in particular places (see Albrechts and Balducci, 2013). It becomes less focused on the \nvisionary and imagining the ‘impossible’ and more concerned with pragmatic \nnegotiations around the ‘immediate’ in a context of the seeming inevitability of \nmarket-based forms of political rationality (see Haughton et al., 2013: 232). Its \nrhetorical commitment to inclusivity limits perceptions of diversity and causes \ndeliberate exclusions (see Watson, 2007). In a phase of deep and rapid change, \ntraditional planning instruments seem to be ineffective because they are designed \nfor situations of stability (Schon, 1971), certainty and a reasonable clarity on the \nproblems to be addressed (Christensen, 1985; Forester, 1993). All these traits are \nlacking in contemporary cities, urban regions and regions. In many places, public \nauthorities looked for new interpretations, new descriptions, which could give a \nsense of what could be appropriate and necessary, to contrast the negative effects \nof change and to devise positive actions. There is a growing need to give a \nsynthetic view of the process of change (Part 1 of the book) and frame future \ndirections of development: a sense-making activity that is critical (the subject of \nPart 2) in order to frame the actions of citizens and governments with a role in \nthe decisions about urban and territorial transformations (the search for new ideas \nin Parts 2 and 3). But, often, this cannot be translated into a ‘plan’ in the traditional sense. This may imply the abandonment of bureaucratic approaches andthe involvement of skills and resources that are external to the traditional administrative apparatus.",

      "abstract": "In the rapidly changing, increasingly uncertain environment the quality of leadership will be the key to business long-term success. The focus will be on the so-called soft skills: humanity, cooperation, social responsibilitiy, ethical behaviour, flexibility, conflict handling and trust building. But how can these skills be acquired?They can most easily be learned through a long-term socialisation process. Family values and early childhood positive education experiences can be the bedrock for developing these skills or human attitudes. Mentors and role models are also very helpful for their continuous development.Interviews with a Hungarian sample of organisational leaders prove these skills cannot be learned in a typical business school which concentrates on managerial techniques for individual competitiveness. In addition, in a society where political connections hold high importance, it is not easy to succeed just based on the earlier-mentioned leadership skills. The leaders indicated that it is also important to keep good connections with the country’s political leaders. The environmental, political and social system, societal cultural values are also influencing factors as expressed by the interviewed leaders.Any development experiences to support leaders must, therefore, take into account the culture of the society in which they live, the context of their organisation and the background of each individual leader. These experiences must also provide opportunities for leaders to learn over time, with others, to continuously reflect on mistakes, change and develop. These are the leaders who will succeed in the long term.",

      "abstract": "Participation is now recognized to be an important issue in many aspects of health care. However, if we want to further our understanding and improve the ways we support patient, consumer, user, lay, or public participation in health care, we need to be clear what we mean by participation and whose participation in what type(s) of activities we are interested in and why. Progress is hampered both by uncritical adoption of the politically correct position that more participation, whatever that is conceived to be, is always a good thing and by debates that are more heated than informed. I suspect that many disputes are born of a lack of clarity: disputants often fail to recognize that they hold different understandings, definitions and images of participation. Disagreements about the merits or otherwise of promoting participation in health care may result from: • different philosophical or ideological stances (leading, for example, to different rationales for thinking participation is a good thing); • the use of similar words to mean different things (for example, people define `consumers', “participation” and `partnerships' in a variety of ways. See Viewpoint article by Herxheimer & Goodare on pp.␣3–6 of this issue); • reference to diverse mental images when discussing a particular concept (for example, people talking about shared decision making may be imagining patients with differing abilities and preferences in a variety of clinical settings contributing in varying ways to decisions of differing complexity and import); • diverse experiences of participation and varying understandings or beliefs about the effects of interventions to promote participation; and • incompatible valuations of the processes and effects of participation. Diverse societal developments and trends in thinking have pushed patient autonomy, consumer rights, community empowerment, active citizenship, and other terms and concepts associated with participation, high up health care policy agendas. These all relate, in some way, to patterns of influence and power, but they have different aims and emphases. Distinctions between different purposes and forms of participation are sometimes confused. Two basic types of argument have been used to promote participation. In the first, participation (or a particular form of it) is viewed as a good thing in its own right. People who adopt this type of argument will probably be keen to promote participation straight away. In the second type of argument, participation (or a particular form of it) is seen as a means to desirable ends such as individually appropriate health care, services responsive to users' needs, or research that addresses questions of importance to patients. People who argue that participation is a good thing if it leads to beneficial ends will be more inclined to both evaluate interventions to promote participation and wait until there is sufficient evidence to suggest that it causes more benefit than harm before they advocate its widespread introduction. A wide range of people might appropriately be encouraged to participate in diverse activities related to health care. However, different issues emerge when we consider the involvement of individual patients in decisions about their health care, service users' (or potential service users') influence over service developments, consumer advocates' input into research agendas or the contribution of members of the public to priority setting. The appropriateness and impact of different forms of participatory engagement vary across participant groups and tasks. Activities to promote participation are usually underpinned by more assumptions than research evidence. In the context of a drive to rigorously assess the effects of health care interventions, activities intended to promote participation should be evaluated, even if the form of participation envisaged is believed to be a good thing in its own right. It cannot be assumed that activities to promote participation will actually result in the participation as envisaged, or that participation will lead to overwhelmingly beneficial effects. In order to assess whether interventions intended to promote participation actually do so, and to investigate what the effects of participation are, we must be able to recognize participation when we see it. We need valid, reliable measures of participation, or at the very least clearly operationalized ways of describing it. Whether considered generically or in a specific form, participation is a complex concept. Measures or descriptors may need to accommodate several dimensions such as who participates (and in relation to whom), the processes by which they are engaged in participation, and the kinds of influence that they have on decisions, practices or policies. Important steps towards description and measurement have been taken in some areas. For example, some of the components of a shared decision making process between a patient and the health professional(s) involved in his or her care have been elucidated,1 and a framework has been offered to help clarify the dimensions of lay involvement in research.2 Other forms of participation are, as yet, only vaguely described. More work is required, for example, to help us understand what constitutes a `partnership' between a formal health authority and a consumer organization, or to assess the extent to which a local community has been involved in decisions about the configuration of its hospital services. Questions arise about the relative merits of measures of general and specific forms of participation, and about the possibility of distinguishing, in a meaningful way, between different `levels' of participation within and across specific forms. Early consensus and establishment of a standard measure or measures would be useful for comparisons across studies and would facilitate meaningful combining of results. However, it is also important that measures are valid, reliable, feasible and sensitive. Since this is a relatively young area in research terms, a fairly lengthy period of testing, debating and revising of measures may be needed. Even given a standard measure and clear evidence from rigorous research about the effects of particular forms of participation, a range of valuations may be placed upon participatory processes and outcomes. People are, therefore, likely to disagree about the adequacy of certain forms of participation and about the balance of benefits, harms and costs of attempts to promote participation. Value judgements will probably be influenced by the context and the problem or task in which participation is considered – so it is important that these are specified. The situation and views of those who seek to participate or whose participation is being sought are also important. For example, it may be appropriate to use different approaches to involve people who do and who do not use particular services in attempts to make those services more attractive, acceptable and accessible. A widespread consensus about the best ways to measure, evaluate and promote participation in health care seems quite a long way off. Meanwhile if we are committed to improving understanding and practice, we should be as clear as we can in our discussions and arguments. We need to specify the contexts, participants, tasks and forms of engagement that we refer to, and to be open about our values, assumptions and reasoning. There are certainly many challenges ahead. I hope that Health Expectations will be a forum in which understanding and debate about all forms of participation in health care can progress.",

      "title": "Workplace Ostracism, Innovative Behavior and Social Network Services",
      "abstract": "The social context has become an important factor within society. Indeed, researchers are likely to agree that the quality of social interactions can significantly affect an organization’s effectiveness (e.g., [1], [2]). Managing interpersonal relationships are essential components for employee performance especially as teamwork has become universal in organizations. However, workplace ostracism has become an organizational concern due to its frequency and impact [3]. Organization studies have consistently found workplace ostracism to negatively affect workplace attitudes and behaviors such as psychological well-being, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, work performance, and organizational citizenship behavior (e.g., [4], [5], [6]). It should be noted that team work is positively related with innovative behavior [7]. Innovation is being considered by many organizations as one of the important ways of getting competitive edge and organizational success [7]. It is not surprising that most organizational innovations rely on creative ideas and individual employees sharing information and interacting with one another. Thinking new ideas can be influenced by communication according to social cognitive theory. Anyone who is involved in a communication network in a team should have necessary capabilities for collaboration in order to provide new ideas, solutions and support timely. If an organization does not help organizational members who lack communication with their peers, innovative behavior from the team member is hardly expected. The new research stream on social media has found that social networking influences knowledge creation effectiveness. In line with the traditional stream of research on innovative behavior, communication powered by social networking is likely to lower barriers for knowledge exchange in an organization. However, it should be noted that studies relating to use of social networking capabilities in knowledge-creating teams have not put much attention on the effect of workplace ostracism. A social networking site, such as Facebook, Instagram and Google+, provides an easy way to contact people who feel discomfort with direct face-to-face communication. As long as the social networking is relating to self-image and trust, functional features relating to communication are beneficial in fulfilling unmet communication needs. The question is, “What role do social network services in the context of ostracism provide?” Can it alleviate the negative effects? Or does it make the situation worse? The study adopted the formal theory associating between job satisfaction and innovative behavior based on social cognitive theory. We empirically tested the mediating effects of job satisfaction for the relationship between workplace ostracism and innovative behavior and the moderating effects of SNS use for work-related purposes for the relationship between workplace ostracism and job satisfaction. Recently, Chung [8] found interpersonal conflict and person-organization fit to mediate the relationships between workplace ostracism and organizational citizenship behavior and deviant behavior while Wu, Yim, Kwan, and Zhang [9] found ingratiation and political skill to moderate the relationship between workplace ostracism and psychological distress. Robinson et al.’s [10] workplace ostracism model suggested that psychological facets can link workplace ostracism and behavioral outcomes while resources and motivation can mitigate the effects of workplace ostracism. The study findings contribute by investigating beyond the direct effects of workplace ostracism and more importantly, provides insightful ideas on the use of social network services for managing communication problems in knowledge-creating teams. Research has found workplace ostracism to negatively impact workplace attitudes and behaviors such as job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance. However, research investigating beyond the direct effects of workplace ostracism and findings about boundary conditions for mitigating the negative effects of workplace ostracism are limited in management studies. In this regard, this study explored the mediating effects of job satisfaction on the relationship between workplace ostracism and innovative behavior and the moderating effects of Social Networking Services for work-related purposes for the relationship between workplace ostracism and job satisfaction. The two-wave study was conducted in Korea and found social network service to moderate the relationship between workplace ostracism and job satisfaction and job satisfaction to mediate the relationship between workplace ostracism and innovative behavior. Ostracized individuals lack social interactions with other organizational members resulting in perceptions that their social and emotional resources are taken away. Social interactions can significantly affect work-related resources because today’s work relies on exchanges with other organizational members that provide support and knowledge. When individuals are ostracized, they will not be able to receive an appropriate amount of work-related and non-work-related resources; therefore, negatively affecting job satisfaction. Furthermore, ostracism decouples organizational members with their organization, organizational members, and jobs that allow the individual to become less emotionally attached. Consistent with previous research, the study found workplace ostracism to be negatively related to job satisfaction. Ostracism results in negative experiences allowing individuals to perceive more negative cognitive evaluations and negative affect. In contrast, when an individual is satisfied with one’s job, s/he is likely to concentrate and engage in behaviors that are beneficial toward the organization such as providing more ideas and energy. Positive affect allows employees to be more willing to generate new ideas for work and create new methods for solving problems. Consequently, the study found job satisfaction to mediate the relationship between workplace ostracism and innovative behavior. This finding supports affective events theory, as experiences at work such as workplace ostracism can decrease job satisfaction that influences cognitive based behaviors such as innovative behavior. This study also found SNS at the workplace to mitigate the negative effects of workplace ostracism on job satisfaction. Ostracized individuals tend to be reluctant to directly interact and communicate with other organizational members due to discomfort and the belief that they lack positive interpersonal relationships with others. Since SNSs can provide methods for indirect communication, ostracized individuals may be able to share information with other organizational members without the discomfort of direct social interactions. SNSs at work can help mitigate the negative effects of workplace ostracism by satisfying one’s needs for resources and information. Further, the study found mediated moderation suggesting that ostracized individuals that frequently used SNSs were more satisfied with their jobs that then positively affected innovative behavior. The findings in this study provide supplementary support to previous exploratory studies on the use of SNS at the workplace. Skeels and Grudin [11] questioned whether SNS use in workplace would reduce productivity. They argued that SNSs could increase productivity; however, empirical evidence was not validated. An empirical study on registered nurses using SNSs revealed that professional communication resulted in mixed outcomes as personal content outweighed work-related content. Although this exploratory observation was repeatedly found in various cases, studies are limited in examining how SNSs can be applied to alleviate organizational issues such as workplace ostracism and innovative behavior.",

      "abstract": "The paper asks how certain zones of technical practice or technologies come to matter as “the Technological”, a way of construing political change in terms of technical innovation and invention. The social construction of technology (SCOT) established that things mediate social relations, and that social practices are constantly needed to maintain the workability of technologies. It also linked the production, representation and use of contemporary technologies to scientific knowledge. However, it did all this at a certain cost. To understand something as socially constructed implies that it can be positioned on a pre‐given social grid. Making this understanding stick risks affronting others with the claim that their position is not singular, only ordinary. It also runs the risk of not having purchase on those aspects of technological relationality that overflow the framing context of the social (Callon et al. 2002 Callon, M.Barry, A. 2002. Technology, politics and the market: an interview with Michel Callon. Economy and Society, 31(2): 285–306. [Google Scholar]). Building on the ground prepared by SCOT and relying on the work of (Stengers 2000 ——. 2000. The invention of modern science, Minneapolis, London: University of Minnesota Press. [Google Scholar]) and (Simondon 1964 ——. 1964. L'Individu et sa genèse physico‐biologique. L'individuation à la Paris [Google Scholar], 1989 ——. 1989. Du mode d'existence des objets techniques, Paris: Aubier. [Google Scholar]), the paper discusses how technologies could be understood as relational events within the contemporary political space. Developing an account of technologies centred on relationality, this paper outlines an epistemology and ontology of the anomalies of technological events, and suggests how excess could explain the Technological.",

The diversity of observations may facilitate social learning because there is no common public history that dominates all individual beliefs. Social learning may be faster if agents observe a smaller sample of past actions. As the social learning cannot be summarized by the martingale of the public belief, the analysis of the convergence of beliefs and actions requires new tools: the average social welfare function, which operates like a Lyapunov function, and the welfare-improving principle.",

      "title": "Translation for social justice: concepts, policies, and practices across modalities and contexts",
      "abstract": "The transnational nature of contemporary movements, media and networks in our globalised and interconnected societies has placed translation at the heart of counter-hegemonic discourses and endeavours. In this context, translation has become a powerful prism through which to think about and practise social justice. Although largely intellectualised in relation to Western liberal welfare states, social justice is also a performative and interpersonal prism of social change with roots historically spread across cultures, traditions and territories and with ramifications in contemporary forms of resistance. Thus, whereas social justice has traditionally been understood as the fair distribution of means and resources and the recognition of people’s rights across status in a given society, the increasing interconnection of struggles across the world has broadened social justice in ways that raise the stakes of translation. The leveraging and enactment of the multiple rights which social justice now encompasses is contingent on the organisation, the practice and the theorisation of translation in all its modalities (translation, interpreting, bilingual facilitation, fixing, subtitling, dubbing) and across communication contexts of resistance (social movements, media networks, cultural institutions). This special issue of the journal explores social justice by delving into specific areas and modalities of translation and interpreting practices. At the same time, it engages with macro-societal issues that affect these practices. These issues range from the power (and the limitations) of translation in circulating counter-hegemonic ideas and knowledge across borders in the publishing, media and cultural industries to the development of curricular, pedagogical and policy-making strategies in a higher education system that is both technologically disrupted and ableist-structured. The issues also include the public institutions’ exclusionary communication practices inherited from colonialisation, patriarchy, and ableism, and the subsequent expectations and actual practices of language professionals’ support to migrants and other vulnerable citizens in this context. The contributions gathered in this special issue contribute to expanding the boundaries of the constantly evolving field of translation while deepening our reflection on the ways in which education, research and practice may reproduce, contest and disrupt systemic injustices.",

      "abstract": "The Weberian sense of work and life suggests that working is something around which the rest of life flows. Moreover, work life and domestic life have been defined as separate for most people based on physical structures. That is, being physically in a building at work limited your ability to interact with those who are not nearby – not part of work. As such, social conventions regarding the uses of media at work have become part of our cultural sensibilities – we “know” it is not proper to have romantic discourse over the office phone, much less romance during work! Doing so becomes news. Yet, despite the construction of such distinctions, these workspaces and places have always been difficult to render as such. For example, one might consider the relatively recent development of teleworking from the 1980s or the “putting out system”[1] which dates back to the 1400s – both requiring work in the home. The papers in this special issue draw our attention to some of the ethical issues raised by the growing pervasiveness of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in our everyday lives and the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult to make distinctions between being somewhere (like work) and being away from some things (like one’s friends, social interests and other parts of life that are not integrated into this space or place [2] )...",

      "abstract": "The Monitoring of social and economic change enables to estimate the consequences of social policy, in particular on the basis of the dynamics of such generalised estimates as people's attitude towards life, observance of social rights, material conditions of families, current mood, evaluation of the present times (namely how difficult they are), and readiness to protest. On the basis of the listed indicators, two significant points are noted: first, the obvious prevalence of negative estimates by practically all indicators (except readiness to protest); second, either an increase of negative estimates or their stagnation observed across all indicators. At present in society, the necessity of a deep social reform aimed at achievement of positive changes has become ripe, first of all in the area of social and labour relations and a system of social guarantees. In the contemporary world, labour behaviour increasingly becomes conditioned by attitudes to a remuneration adequate to workers' expectations and capable of satisfying their various needs and requirements (material, professional, status-related, and personal ones). Concerning the level of understanding of importance of motivation process for labour efficiency, Russia is noticeably behind the world's leading countries. The problem of earningsrate has become still more urgent than in the Soviet period. According to notions expressed by employed respondents, their average earnings today are approximately three-fold lower than they deserve. Under Russia's conditions, for most people work increasingly becomes the source of means for survival, whereas in the developed industrial countries the significance of socio-psychological stimuli is increasing (recognition and approval of results of work, need for respect from human environment, for recognition and approval of achievements, need for self-expression and realisation of personal potential, satisfaction -with results of -work, possibilities of creative and business career, professional promotion, success, need for communication, support, participation, responsibility, etc.). At present, the question must be creation of a new system of social guarantees, really ensuring social protection to every citizen in a society based on market relations. Despite deep changes in society, the public prefers a pattern of the development of social guarantees when the government assumes responsibility for satisfaction of the most significant social needs of people. The question is, in the first place, predominantly free school education and health services. It seems that the logic of mass consciousness in this case fully conforms to economic efficiency and social utility.",

Maka peran lembaga Sekolah, khususnya Setiap lembaga SMK berlomba bagaimana mempersiapkan para lulusannya mampu bersaing di dunia kerja, untuk mengurangi pengangguran dan menanggulangi kemiskinan agar ekonomi masyarakat tumbuh berkembang menuju masyarakat yang sejahtera. Tetapi sedikit lembaga Pendidikan yang mempersiapkan para lulusannya dengan karakter kemandirian dengan berproses pada pengelolaan hati sebagai kendali utamanya. Dan banyak para lulusan di tingkat SMK yang mampu bekerja untuk memenuhi kebutuhan ekonomi keluarga, tetapi sering mengesampingkan pengelolaan hati. Sehingga terjadi ketidakpuasan diri merasa kurang akan hasil yang sudah didapatkan karena tidak mampu mencukupi segala keinginan.

      "title": "Agents adapt to majority behaviours",
      "abstract": "Agents within a group can have different percep- tions of their working environment and autonomously fulfil their goals. However, they can be aware of beliefs and goals of the group as well as other members so that they can adjust their behaviours accordingly. To model these agents, we explicitly include knowledge commonly shared by the group and that obtained from other agents. By avoiding actions which violate shared by the majority of the group, agents demonstrate their social commitment to the group. Defeasible logic is chosen as our representation formalism for its computa- tional efficiency, and for its ability to handle incomplete and conflicting information. Hence, our agents can enjoy the low computational cost while performing about others. Finally, we present the implementation of our multi-agent system. As can be observed from a society, every individual member can take any action driven by his/her desires. However, the individuals are often required to comply with the society conventions. Essentially conventions could be norms, con- straints or desires which are popularly recognised by the soci- ety. Being aware of those conventions, an individual member can strengthen his/her social relationships and coordinates better with other members. Similarly, in a multi-agent system, an agent maintains its social commitments by discovering the common and fulfils its own demands whilst obligating to these attitudes. Hence agents reason not only about their own beliefs and goals but also about those of other agents. Besides, agents autonomously observe and judge their surroundings by their own view resulting in partial and sometimes conflicting descriptions of the world. Consequently, modelling those agents requires representing and reasoning with incomplete and conflicting information, which is beyond the classical logics and monotonic reasoning. Recently, defeasible logic (DL)(1), (2) has attracted consid- erable interest from the research community (3)-(5), especially in application to modelling rational agents (6)-(9). DL is an elegant and computationally efficient tool (10), (11) to deal with partial and conflicting knowledge. The key advantage of DL is being able to draw a plausible conclusion from a reasonable amount of information. In addition, DL provides a compact representation and an effective way to accommodate new information. In this paper, we propose a new modelling technique based on DL to explicitly describe the knowledge that is commonly shared by agents, and that obtained from other agents. The new model enables an agent to reason about the environment and the intentions of other agents. Social actions are achieved by balancing between the desires of an individual and the beliefs of the majority. To tackle multi-source reasoning, we extend the reasoning mechanism of DL with the notion of superior knowledge. This new mechanism allows an agent to integrate its mental attitudes with a more trustworthy source of information such as the knowledge shared by the majority of other agents. In the implementation of our multi-agent system, we add modal notions including Belief, Intention, and Obligation in order to have a fine grained model of and social actions. In the rest of this paper, we firstly describe the basic concepts of DL in Section II. We then introduce our modelling technique and discuss discuss how to represent the knowledge base of agents including the meta-knowledge about agents' importance in Section III. Also, we outline the strategies to allow agents to discover approximate common among the group and the mechanism for reasoning with a priority source of knowledge. In Section IV, we present the architecture of our system including the extension of Rule Markup Language as a knowledge representation tool and the algorithm of the reasoning engine. Finally, we provides an overview of research works related to our system in Section V.",

      "abstract": "Community program evaluations, visioning and assessments must always endeavor to attain useful information in the most sensitive way.Most community-based organizations form, grow and continue on their own without the help of outside experts.Participatory approaches should respect the historical evolution of these groups and understand the positive factors that underlie their organizational beliefs.A group's mission, values and identity should inform any community program evaluation, consulting project, and the design of any research study.Narrative methods have been used with mutual-help groups and many other organizations to good effect (Harré, Bullen, & Olson, 2006;Rappaport, 2000).Such methods have great potential to avoid hierarchical and unidirectional forms of evaluation, encouraging the group's collective psychology and identity-based constructs to emerge.We developed a participatory, narrative technique called Community Narration (CN), which is described here.The technique utilizes personal stories and community narratives as an entry into the evaluation process or other work involved in understanding an organization.The community's participants were able to use the technique successfully, found it enriching, and the constructs obtained have led to many discussions and memberguided research related to the organization.Community-based techniques such as empowerment evaluation, attempt to reduce hierarchies between the \"consultant\" and the organization (Fetterman, Kaftarian, & Wandersman, 1996; Fetterman & Wandersman, 2005).Whether the goal involves visioning with another organization, creating a needs assessment, or evaluation, there is a need to move toward less rigid methods in order to discover an organization or community's identity, its collective goals, and implicit aspects of its mission.The organizational identity is often built on a collection of personal beliefs and experiences shared by those who make up the community.Personal identities are structured around stories (McAdams, 2009; McAdams & Olson, 2010).Community narratives, made up of personally stories, are equally the foundation of a group's or community's identity (Harré, Bullen, & Olson, 2006;Rappaport, 2000).",

      "title": "Public Opinion",
      "abstract": "The concepts of public opinion differ within the European and Anglo-Saxon research cultures. Whereas the European model of public opinion is placed within the discourses of public sphere and public debate along a normative idea, the Anglo-Saxon alternative is rather focused on demographic surveys to measure and quantify public opinion. These different perspectives certainly affect the transnational or even global idea of public opinion. In a US perspective, public opinion is seen as the simple addition of individual opinions (Frankovic 1998), for example in the case of the concept of agenda-setting and the formation of a public agenda (McCombs & Shaw 1972). In turn, the European perspective on public opinion negates a rather statistical aggregate of public opinion and attributes its own version as a product of collective communication and discourses in the public sphere. In this normative understanding, public opinion emerges from the triangle of reason, argument and dialogue. Public opinion in a European perspective is not the addition of all individual opinions in a discourse but the result of this discourse. As a medium of societal requirements, demands, and discourses, public opinion manages the public agenda and sets issues for societal and political decision making (Noelle-Neumann 2001; Gerhards & Neidhardt 1993). Interestingly, the European concept is based on the ideas of the US scholar Walter Lippmann (1922). This view was also reflected in the United States, but was operationalized foremost in European studies. The US scholar Maxwell McCombs stated: “Walter Lippmann consciously prefaced Public Opinion with Plato's allegory of the cave where the prisoners in the cave could see only the reflections of reality on the wall before them” (McCombs et al. 1991: 10). In particular, the origins of the concept of public opinion stem from the eighteenth and nineteenth century: European intellectuals like Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville developed this concept in opposition to authoritarian monarchs.",

      "abstract": "Structurally fragile states are plagued by deeply entrenched sociopolitical and institutional problems. They harbour uniquely formidable obstacles to stability, development and democracy. Too often, international efforts to aid transitions in these places fail because they emphasise the importance of the vertical state– society relationship and social contract while completely ignoring the factors shaping the horizontal dynamics within society that determine how the state–society relationship evolves and whether or not such a contract can even be fashioned. A better approach would address these challenges directly, by developing a “social covenant” that brings together various ethnic, religious, clan and ideological groups to create a more inclusive and sustainable political process and social contract. As South Africa’s transition shows, a society that has reached agreement on its fundamental principles and values (e.g. who is a citizen and what makes for a legitimate government) through a social covenant is much better equipped to forge a sustainable social contract than one divided by stark fault lines, especially when institutions are weak and unable to enforce rules and commitments. Although domestic actors have the predominant role in any transition, the international community can play a pivotal role in supporting the negotiation process and shaping the transition framework and in both monitoring commitments and ensuring that they are kept.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, skills for the informal sector have been acquired informally, in family and community settings. Within these settings, the acquisition and utilisation of skills entails (a) active, improvisational engagement with materials and local ecologies; (b) induction into ethical or normative frameworks; and (c) connection to a community of practitioners and the assumption of socially meaningful identities. In recent decades, formal training programmes have emerged in relation to skills in the informal sector, as have attempts to integrate informal learning for informal sector skills within formal qualifications frameworks. Given the corporate dominance of much of the TVET sector in the Global South, such transitions may introduce pro-corporate biases into skill systems. Drawing on neo-Marxist theories, I suggest that through such transitions, skills are subsumed in the sense that skills and processes of skill acquisition are prioritised that enhance possibilities for capitalist growth and are alienated in the sense that people are removed from modalities of skill acquisition that are sources of connection, meaning, identity, and belonging. They supplant a rich, socially imbricated understanding of skills with one in which skills (and life) are seen to be in service to maximising efficiency. I illustrate this through reference to emerging attempts to promote formal sector training for informal sector agricultural workers in India. I argue that despite processes of alienation and subsumption being at play, there are nonetheless instances where less alienated understandings of skill and skill acquisition intervene.",

      "title": "Diffusion of Information and Innovation",
      "abstract": "Diffusion is a multifaceted perspective about social change in which people, innovations, and the media environment affect how rapidly change occurs. Scholars dating back at least to the German social philosopher Georg Simmel and the French sociologist Gabriel Tarde theorized about imitative behavior at the level of small groups and within communities, and the relation between these micro‐level processes to macro‐level social change. In the 100 years since, researchers have tended to conceptualize diffusion either at the macro sociological level of sector, system, national, or state change (Dearing et al. 2006), the social psychological or communicative level of local relationships and how those linkages affect adoption patterns as in the classic studies by Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955) and by Rogers and Kincaid (1981), or the psychological level of how individuals perceive innovations in the form of a codified set of pros and cons (Manning et al. 1995). Beginning in the 1960s, diffusion concepts have been operationalized and used to purposively spread pro‐social innovations through → development communication in Colombia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, India, Finland, Korea, Tanzania, Bolivia, and Vietnam (see, e.g., Puska et al. 1986). Diffusion research has been conducted in single countries, comparatively across countries, and by tracing innovations across countries (Greenhalgh et al. 2004).",

This may in turn affect the overall well-being and life satisfaction of people with disability. Less clear are the ways in which location may affect social participation and access to social support among people with disability. Although it has been argued that regional or rural living facilitates social connectedness and access to social support, the validity of this theory in the context of disability has not been assessed. This study investigates different types of community involvement, levels of perceived social support, and self-reported life satisfaction among regional people with disability relative to their counterparts living in major cities. Regional people with disability report higher involvement in volunteer work, more frequent attendance at community events, and stronger feelings of being part of their community, which partially supports the hypothesis that location and social participation are related. The findings show that despite greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage regional living can be associated with enhanced social connectedness.",

The purposes, commitments, disclosures and rewards of self-agreements are viewed as mechanisms used to deal with the problematical. Individuals' testimony indicates that awareness of processes involved in articulating self-agreements vary from little to highly active internal negotiating. Findings from an open-ended questionnaire given to 313 respondents are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the field of early childhood education, dominant discourse is premised on assumptions and values that privilege uniformity, generality, and even the \"essential\" nature of children and programs that should then be judged according to common criteria. In this article, we focus not on common factors that vary but on particular social practices that have very different meanings for people in two social settings (Taylor, 1979). Specifically, we describe how parent involvement- and parents themselves-were socially constructed within Head Start programs located in different communities, and we suggest how these social practices made particular forms of involvement possible and even necessary. We argue that discourses do not merely represent; they constitute, and different discourses construct both subjects and social relations in particular ways. Finally, we suggest how alternative ways of structuring knowledge and social practice in early childhood might become \"communal tools\" for exploring yet to be realized possibilities.",

      "abstract": "Strategic communication has been dened as “the purposeful use of communication by an organization to fulll its mission” (Hallahan, Holtzhausen, Van Ruler, Vercˇicˇ, & Sriramesh, 2007, \np. 4). It is “not random or unintentional” (p. 27) although unintended consequences can ensue; \nit is not aimed at control but takes environment into consideration through dialogue or emergent \nstrategy. From this standpoint, strategic communication is inclusive and exible, but still fundamentally managed, purposive, and organization-centered-at least, within its home organization. \nThis chapter focuses on the problem of what happens after such communication enters the public \narena, where it shares space with random unwanted associations that distort the original intent \nof the message. Ultimately this chapter poses two questions that grow out of this contextual \ndependence:1. How strategic can “strategic communication” be, given the distortions imposed by the \nenvironment outside?",

      "title": "El uso estratégico del silencio en conversaciones de mujeres: ¿reafirmación o transgresión del feminolecto?",
      "abstract": "espanolDesde un enfoque constructivista, se ha considerado que el sexolecto o estilo comunicativo de mujeres y hombres responde a normas socioculturales que se reafirman o transgreden en la interaccion, dependiendo de si se cumplen o no las reglas comunicativas que rigen lo “femenino” y “masculino” (Calero, 2007; Serrano, 2008; Acuna, 2009). Es por esa razon que la sociolinguistica actual aboga por analizar las identidades sociales de los hablantes en las actuaciones verbales y no verbales cotidianas. Este trabajo analiza los actos silenciosos de un grupo de mujeres en conversaciones coloquiales. Los resultados de la investigacion sugieren que los silencios analizados responden unas veces a “practicas de identidad negativa”, que transgreden las actuaciones pragmaticas esperables en ellas, y otras veces a “practicas de identidad positiva”, que reafirman los comportamientos comunicativos propios del feminolecto (Bucholtz, 1999). Tambien indican que las identidades sociales se negocian mediante la practica conversacional en cada encuentro comunicativo. EnglishThe constructivist studies have considered the communication style of women and men is due to sociocultural norms that reaffirm or transgress in the interaction. This depends on whether or not respect the male and female communication rules (Calero, 2007; Serrano, 2008; Acuna, 2009). For that reason the current sociolinguistic prefer to analyze the social identities of the speakers in verbal and nonverbal actions daily. This paper analyzes the silence of a group of women in colloquial conversations. The research results suggest that silences analyzed can be negative identity practices which transgress pragmatic expected performances in them, and positive identity practices which reaffirm their own communicative behaviors of women (Bucholtz, 1999). They also indicate that social identities are negotiated through conversational practice in each communicative act.",

Or, l’intensite des debats sur ce theme dans la philosophie et la sociologie contemporaines temoigne de sa complexite, voire de son obscurite. Lorsqu’on passe du courant liberal « deontologiste », a certaines tendances du courant communautarien, du marxisme ou du courant republicain, voire a la sociologie critique ou a l’individualisme methodologique, c’est a chaque fois un nouveau paysage de la reconnaissance, une problematique differente qui apparait. Qui doit reconnaitre qui ou quoi ? Au nom de quoi ? Sous quelles formes ? Et, d’ailleurs, qu’est ce que reconnaitre ?C’est cette variete des emplois du concept de reconnaissance, les possibilites theoriques qu’elle ouvre et les difficultes conceptuelles qu’elle suscite que le present livre se propose d’interroger.",

      "abstract": "I believe that one of the greatest strengths of the social work profession is its generalist foundation, which welcomes and uses knowledge from other helping professions. Indeed, the generalist approach and its welcoming of relevant knowledge from multiple disciplines allows social workers flexibility in helping to resolve diverse potential issues at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels. Such flexibility and creativity have always been valuable to the social work profession, yet these qualities become even more important as we move toward the future. Technological advancement brings new social issues, creates alternative identities and lifestyles, complicates power dynamics that underlie important social justice issues, and produces additional possibilities for understanding social and behavioral phenomena. Because we live at a time of rapid technological development and change, there is a salient need for more academic and professional creativity and flexibility that can be fueled by our passion, power, and purpose to address various complex issues at micro, mezzo, and macro levels (Bent-Goodley, 2014).",

The longer the periods of oppression, the more emotionally weakened individuals and families become. Social psychologists, social worker change experts, and others have utilized large and small group techniques that access earlier personal memories – family memories and interpersonal conflicts – to explore the nature of oppression. Whether in conference settings, educational environments, or specialized professional training programs, professionals (e.g., Jones, 1996; Schatz, Furman, &amp; Jenkins, 2003) have offered creative group-oriented approaches, e.g. theatric and dialogue group processes, to examine the personal nature of oppression and the healing that can come from these group experiences. This paper explores creative theatre and dialogue in multinational learning settings.",

      "title": "Process vs. event",
      "abstract": "Despite their interdependence, the concepts of 'process' and 'event' are often distinguished from one another in social movement studies. Where events are conceptualized as discrete, temporally-bound, externally-directed products of collective struggle, processes refer to their continuous, ever-shifting practices and democratic potentialities. Events, as unitary entities, may consist of particular projects or products in citizen media, whereas processes, as fluid arrangements, encompass a diverse range of methods and practices surrounding—and making possible—the production and circulation of content. In citizen media, as in other forms of resistance, disproportionate scholarly attention has been paid to tangible, visible 'outputs' (or events), rather than to the more abstract, less visible 'inputs' (or processes) that facilitate or constrain the former. In recent years, the everyday, temporally-extended social practices and tensions within social movements have garnered increasing attention. As a result, citizen media events are increasingly understood as physical and digital extensions—or public expressions—of ongoing, deliberative processes, rather than as spontaneous eruptions of creative resistance. Moreover, events are recognized as points along a continuum: not only as products of preceding activities, but as sites of process-oriented (re)generation. Beyond their practical inseparability, distinguishing process from event is further complicated in citizen media initiatives guided by the prefigurative ethos, whereby the medium itself embodies the empancipatory message of movement actors. Drawing on theoretical and empirical works, this entry will examine the nature and meaning of 'process vs. event' in citizen media, and discuss the theoretical and practical significance of the distinction.",

There are structural (e.g. family size), functional (e.g. level of support) and appraisal (e.g. attitudes, beliefs, mood) aspects involved in shaping each person’s experience of social engagement or isolation. The relationship between stress, resilience and social engagement will also be discussed. Current evidence indicates a link between isolation and poor health outcomes and mortality; however, more research is needed to assess the impact of loneliness. Although it is widely accepted that supporting social connections is beneficial, there is as yet little robust evidence for the effectiveness of interventions addressing loneliness and isolation.",

Participants were formerly homeless English or Spanish speaking unaccompanied adults (N=405), aged 39 years or older, living in supportive housing for 3 months. Housing model and neighborhood were examined separately with social network measures in controlled multivariable linear regression models. Compared to Skid Row residents, DTLA residents reported less emotional support and less tangible support, while residents in Other neighborhoods reported less emotional support and less instrumental support.

From a theoretical point of view, such experiences could give a new perspective on the classical concept of discipline proposed by Foucault, putting it in relation with the Marcuse's theory of necessary/additional repression.",

(Brdar and Pokrajec - Bulian, 1993, according to Katz and McClellen, 1999; Modric, 2016). In order for a person to be socially competent, they must have adopted social skills. One of the areas of social competence research is co-operative and prosocial behavior. (Brajsa-Žganec, 2003, according to Hrženjak, 2016) Prosocial behavior is a behavior that is consistent with the purpose of helping others or making a benefit to someone else (Eron and Huesman, 1990, Lewis and Miller, 1990, Kerestes, According to Brebic, 2008), ie, the form of moral behavior of an individual in manifesting socially desirable behaviors such as co-operation, helping, comforting, and sharing with others. (Only associates, 1998, according to Kljucevic, 2008) Given that play is a fundamental child activity through which the child develops and learns about the world in which he lives, it should be enriched so that the children gain the highest quality experience for their own development, especially positive experiences of socialization. Research shows that social competence for successful private as well as business life, is more important than other factors. Symbolic play requires a high level of interaction with other players and is an excellent platform for adopting and developing social competencies, and thus pro-social skills. An enriched, framed and guided symbolic game is a dramatic play, one of dramatic education methods. (Lekic et al., 2007) Except it allowes children to use all their potentials because it is based on framework structure, ie it is only necessary to determine the dramatic situation, which is mostly a conflict, moral dilemma or problem solving, it is always played in pairs or groups. These are the primary reasons why children develop social skills and emotional intelligence through this method and thus adopt prosocial behavior.",

One is struck, in this regard, by the extreme diversity (often mutually exclusive) of criteria in the approaches to the study of these problems. Of course, this may be partially explained by the complexity of the subject under study. But in the case in point, the reason is primarily the presence of acute social contradictions in capitalist society itself, of methodological and ethical pluralism, and of the extreme contradictoriness of the initial theoretical positions characteristic of bourgeois social thought. (1) For example, within a single collection, Sociology and Social Problems. A Conceptual Approach (2), one may find not only different but even mutually exclusive points of view on the same question. But for all the diversity of starting points, approaches and arguments, styles and methods of presentation, it is still possible to identify two common features that mark all such writings to some extent.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of the research. The article is about the phenomenon of “strategic instability” as a result of the implementation of various information and communication technologies in the modern media space. Considering strategic instability as a state of existing social systems, the authors subject the ideas and concepts of “controlled chaos”, “new normal” and “end of history” to a socio-philosophical analysis. Conclusions. Modern information and communication strategies have a negative impact on the functioning of various social structures (the creation of “new”, deconstruction, decomposition, destruction), the formation of public consciousness, the construction of the agenda and the geopolitical situation on the world stage, etc., as a result of which strategic instability is comprehended society as the norm of modern life, and the existing threats to state are not perceived at the proper level. It seems that the way out of this situation is to use the methodology of information and strategic modeling (creation of virtual projects of “state systems as a future reality”).",

      "abstract": "The article deals with socio-cultural factors affecting the degree of integration of reluctant migrants in Ukrainian society. Two indicators of integration were used: the existence of strong social ties with members of the host community and the participation and / or interest in the life of the host community. The results of a sociological survey are presented, the tasks of which were, first, the identification of actual skills and abilities that can (or do not suffice) for reluctant migrants from Donbass to integrate into host communities, and secondly, the level of integration of reluctant migrants on the basis of their self-identification. According to the results of the survey, only 41 % of reluctant migrants consider themselves integrated into the host community, 16 % do not consider themselves integrated at all; 31 % consider themselves only partially integrated, 3 % do not want to integrate, and 9 % found it difficult to answer. Among the skills and abilities that helped reluctant migrants to settle in a new place, the ability to resist stress (51 %) and the ability to create social ties (43 %) are leading. Knowledge of foreign languages (38 %), entrepreneurial skills (30 %) are among the skills that are lacking for reluctantmigrants. The results of the research show correlation between the level of integration of reluctant migrants in receiving communities and the ability to create and accumulate relevant social capital in the form of new horizontal links and cultural capital in the form of personal skills and competencies.",

A social tie may involve family, profession, political leanings, race and ethnicity, religion, place oforigin, education, hobbies, etc. Some social ties are dynamic, slow to develop or fleeting (e.g., accrued trust through prior transactional experiences, aged over time), while others are permanent (e.g., familial ties). So, a social tie between individuals χ and y involves a plurality of factors which may be characterizable by a feature vector wχ,y, where social ties are asymmetrical in general, i.e., wχ,y ≠ wy,x, and wχ,y is naturally dependent on corresponding features of the individuals χ and y themselves. Metrics between individuals' feature vectors can be formulated and social subgroups (cliques) can then be found, e.g., using hierarchical or K Nearest Neighbors hard clustering or soft (probabilistic) clustering via Expectation–Maximization (EM) on a Gaussian mixture model [51].",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social movements, as collective entities, develop to stand up against the existing institutional status quo with a view to its reformation or radical transformation, while the degree to which they are political depends on wider socio-political factors. The diverse action that evolved through their organized mobilization marked the radical transformation of political response, but also the type of state intervention. Social movements exactly because they constitute wider socio-political undertakings that aim to bring about changes in the social, political, economic but also cultural processes, which seek to annul or sideline established standardizations, are considered one of the most readily available ways to express political and social claims; here they are understood to be dynamic interventions in institutionally and structurally complete social systems as in the case of the social state. Within the context of political mobilization and collective social action, social movements functioned at two interrelated levels: the level of expansion, but also of redefinition of social intervention processes in order to achieve the goals of the social state, and the cultural level, a symbolic promotion, in order to establish a greater degree of social justice. Mobilization of resources, collective behaviour for making claims, even contentious action and transaction with institutions and authorities, constitute views of social transformation and political process in the context of the creation and development of the social state.",

A product that the user does not wish to interact with will not be considered as meaningful for that person, and such a product will elicit negative emotions, perhaps expressed as unpleasant feelings. Using Emotional Universal Design (EUD) Principles as complements to the seven original Universal Design (UD) Principles is one way to initiate a dis-cussion about how socio-cultural obstacles can also be reduced or even eliminated in society.

      "abstract": "Cooperation is of utmost importance to society as a whole, but is often challenged by individual self-interests. While game theory has studied this problem extensively, there is little work on interactions within and across groups with different preferences or beliefs. Yet, people from different social or cultural backgrounds often meet and interact. This can yield conflict, since behavior that is considered cooperative by one population might be perceived as non-cooperative from the viewpoint of another.To understand the dynamics and outcome of the competitive interactions within and between groups, we study game-dynamical replicator equations for multiple populations with incompatible interests and different power (be this due to different population sizes, material resources, social capital, or other factors). These equations allow us to address various important questions: For example, can cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma be promoted, when two interacting groups have different preferences? Under what conditions can costly punishment, or other mechanisms, foster the evolution of norms? When does cooperation fail, leading to antagonistic behavior, conflict, or even revolutions? And what incentives are needed to reach peaceful agreements between groups with conflicting interests?Our detailed quantitative analysis reveals a large variety of interesting results, which are relevant for society, law and economics, and have implications for the evolution of language and culture as well.",

      "title": "Game appropriation :where does the gamer fit?",
      "abstract": "The socio-technological transformation of digital games means that they are no longer single-player, co-located game experiences but instead are multiplayer socially-oriented ones (e.g. World of Warcraft). This change underpins the central concern of this thesis, to understand game appropriation and the intrinsically motivating nature of gaming. Game appropriation is defined as the broad incorporation of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) into gamers’ daily practices, including the nature of their gameplay. Gaming is not viewed as a set of defined moments of participation but as a dynamic activity, directly interrelated with a gamers’ everyday life. Therefore, a broad perspective on motivation and gaming is adopted, incorporating not only reinforcing aspects of game design but also acknowledging the role of the social context and the gamer as an individual during gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe findings of three studies showed that game design, social interaction and gamers’ psychological characteristics uniquely interplay to support game appropriation. The key findings are: (i) Flexible game design is a prerequisite for game appropriation; multiple game structures enable the creation of collaborative and competitive relationships and contribute to innovative forms of play; (ii) Diverse forms of social interaction, within and around gameplay, define the nature of game appropriation; (iii) The role of the gamer in game appropriation is critical. The gamer as an individual is the agent defining the distinct social forms of play when shaping the game experience, underpinned by certain psychological characteristics. While gamers with higher trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) play for social interaction per se, those with lower trait EI make purposive use of sociality in order to progress and succeed in the game. Similarly, on a needs scale (Basic Psychological Needs Scale) lower scorers on autonomy are more prone to competitive and instrumental social gaming practices; (iv) The process of game appropriation is progressively developed, influenced by the type of in-game activities and novel game features, trait EI scores and the presence of other gamers in the game. \r\n\r\nIn summary, game appropriation, being game-specific, begins with the interaction between the gamer and a flexible game design and becomes socially negotiated within a community of gamers. The final social configuration -instrumental or social per se- is influenced by certain psychological characteristics of gamers as individuals.",

      "abstract": "We develop a framework for understanding noncitizenship that combines attention to systemic processes with interest in contingency and indeterminacy in the production and substantive practices associated with noncitizen legal status categories and trajectories. We argue that noncitizenship is a dynamic, multi-scalar assemblage that brings together disparate elements in patterned and changing ways. Individuals and institutions generate the formal and substantive systems that confer or deny noncitizens the formal and substantive right to be present in a country and/or to access entitlements. Noncitizens exercise agency in choosing to make claims (or choosing to not make claims) to substantive rights, and the individuals and institutions with which they interact may facilitate or hinder such claims-making. In this process, social actors are enacting conditionality; they are working to meet the conditions required to maintain presence and access. Discretion, migrant agency, unequal social interactions, and social learning unfold over time and can generate a range of experiences of noncitizenship and legal status trajectories. These do not necessarily conform to expected pathways and timelines, and may combine access to various resources and public goods in variable and contingent ways. We illustrate the framework with data from research conducted in Toronto.",

Lithuanian attitudes toward their own and other dialects are much less positive. In addition to that, the quantitative data has revealed the differences in the attitude of Lithuanian and Slovenian inhabitants regarding the importance of dialect in connection with the national identity. The questionnaire was administered during March and April of 2012. It consisted of multiple choice questions.

Community psychologists play a vital role in addressing systemic barriers to good health and wellbeing. While they do work to support behaviour change with individuals and groups, fundamental to their approach is also working at a broader level to reduce inequality and build systems and structures that enable and empower communities. This work recognises the social determinants of health that lie in disadvantage and exclusion. The role of community psychologists is not always explicitly recognised (as they do not always work within an 'expert model' and thus may not be employed under that title), but they can be found in urban and rural settings, developing and implementing interventions at a national, State and/or local community level in areas such as local government, education, community health, within local neighbourhoods and in non-government organisations. Three key roles for community psychologists in the health arena are profiled below.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Several papers published in recent years have revived interest in Sorokin's dissociative thesis: the view that intergenerational social mobility has detrimental effects on the social relationships and wellbeing of individuals. In this paper, I test the dissociative thesis using data from the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society. On a wide range of indicators that measure participation in civic associations, contact with parents, close personal relationships, social support, subjective wellbeing, etc. individuals who have achieved long‐range upward mobility (i.e. those who move from working class origin to salariat destination) tend to fare better than those who are immobile in the working class. Those who have experienced long‐range downward mobility (moving from salariat origin to working class destination) do about as well as second‐generation members of the working class. Overall, there is no support for Sorokin's thesis.",

      "abstract": "Family are the oldest way of doing business and are one of the foundations of a global market economy. long-term prospect of managing them through generations, as well as combining family and managerial functions, provides them with a clear identity. Succession and the planning of it is a complex process of developing and implementing a strategic plan of transferring ownership and power by the owner (or owners) of a family enterprise to a selected successor who will be able to ensure the continuation and development of the family enterprise in accordance with the adopted strategy. competencies of the successors are the subject of numerous studies. They are of a general nature and refer to fragmentary aspects of the problem. There are no descriptions and analyses regarding the emotional intelligence competencies in the process of succession in the literature of the subject. Contemporary owners reach for non-economic values and various scientific disciplines - the law, sociology, psychology, or social economy, in order to use the knowledge in a rational way in the process of educating and shaping the personality of a future successor. main objective of the paper by M. Dźwigol-Barosz entitled The development of competencies in the area of emotional intelligence in the process of succession in contemporary family enterprises is an attempt to build a model of competence development in the area of emotional intelligence of successors in the process of succession in family enterprises. author, in this research layer, agrees with the suggestions of D. Goleman that the intelligence quotient and the emotional intelligence constitute different ability groups and that people with a high intelligence quotient and a low level of emotional intelligence, as well as those with a low quotient and a high level of emotional intelligence are rarely encountered. An attempt to answer this question has been made in this paper. In the first chapter, the essence and the definition of a family enterprise in a modern market economy, both global and Polish, are discussed. second chapter refers to the succession in a family enterprise, the essence of the matter in Polish law and business activity has been presented. contemporary manager as a potential successor is the topic of the third chapter. In the fourth one, the model of developing the competencies of the successors in the area of emotional intelligence has been discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Political socialization (PS) has been defined in various ways in the literature. Among the most frequently encountered definitions is the one that equates PS with mere learning, that is, the state of a person's political knowledge and comprehension. Other definitions focus less on an individual's knowledge inventory than on the developmental sequence by which such knowledge and comprehension are acquired, whereas others focus on the continuity over time of such knowledge and attitudes. However, PS is more and more defined as the gradual development of the individual's own particular and idiosyncratic views of the political world, the process by which a given society's norms and behavior are internalized. This has three main theoretical consequences: primary and secondary socializations are equally important in the socializing process; it follows that not only family and school are central instances of socialization but also many other institutions active in the life spheres of work, affective ties, voluntary work and political engagements; and the political dimension is in play in all socialization processes and doesn't correspond to a specific domain of activity or designated institutions.",

      "abstract": "The basic effort in “regulation of help in dying” is a cultural one. The social and professional energies must above all be directed towards a renovated “organisation of care in dying” that, far from breaking off our relationships, strengthens them. That, besides providing dignity to dying, facilitates “living” it humanely inasmuch as possible, attending to the biopsycho-socio-emotional (and spiritual) dimension. At the individual level the desire to die rather than to continue living is a drama that requires mobilising the moral effort of everyone, according to the corresponding responsibility for exploring and evaluating the situation in the search for alternative plans. And, at the social level, the fact of not providing an open outcome to those highly exceptional situations (between 01-2%) can be a tragedy. But the basic social effort does not lie at the end, in providing or not proving a way out, for a few patients (although the accumulated data for Oregon indicate that there is no slippery slope and in Holland there has been a change of attitude towards a fall in euthanasia facing the rise of the alternative of terminal sedation). The cultural, social, organisational, professional and individual effort from which we will all benefit comes much earlier, and involves changing our paradigm of care in particular at the end of life. Although death is inevitable, dying badly should not be so unavoidable.",

This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) \"adaptive preferences,\" in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations---concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews---through which people mediate their perceptions of themselves and the world around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institution may have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by law may remain excluded through custom and habits of the mind. Recognizing new forces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them. Some interventions have had very consequential impacts.",

      "abstract": "The governance of emotions has become part of the educational experience of many, if not most, school pupils in England. Governance, as understood by Foucault (1991), is a particular form of encounter between states and subjects. Rather than acting directly on subjects, the state instead 'responsibilises' subjects, so that they turn on themselves to monitor, act and thus produce the right kind of selfhood. Schools, as the main site for the formation of future subjects, offer a realm in which this kind of responsibilisation can take place. While this might happen across a variety of registers, the one under discussion here is emotional governance. The right kind of emotional subjecthood, framed via a wider 'cultural and political \"therapeutic\" sensibility' (Ecclestone, 2010: 62), serves an immediate instrumental aim to create children to function as 'pupils' in the institutional context of the school (i.e. non-disruptive, conforming to disciplinary norms, able to learn) and is seen as increasingly important in its own right (as a fundamental part of individual wellbeing and happiness), as well as being positioned to be 'integral to personal development, life and work success' (Ecclestone, 2010: 63).",

      "abstract": "Public service motivation (PSM) refers to an individual’s motivation to contribute to society. It relates to ideas about society, and about what public servants are and how they should behave, that have persisted for more than 2,500 years. Despite this heritage, PSM was only formally conceptualized in the 1990s. The concept of PSM has traditionally been linked to several beneficial outcomes, such as public performance and public servants’ satisfaction, but recently also to negative outcomes, such as burnout and rule-breaking. While PSM is an individual-level concept, the role of the social environment is crucial to understanding PSM. On the one hand, social institutions play an important role in creating individual-level PSM through socializing mechanisms. Institutions such as the family and workplace, and other structured value-based interaction patterns, correlate with the prevalence of individual PSM. On the other hand, to render outcomes, interaction with the environment—in terms of fit—is necessary, because PSM cannot exert influence outside a context where public values are prominent. As most research focuses on public servants in their work environment, this fit mostly entails a match of the individual public servant with the organization or the job. If this fit is lacking, little or no PSM occurs. Although PSM research was initially a theoretical and psychometric exercise, it is increasingly put to practical use.",

The political process model, by most accounts the dominant framework for thinking about social movements today, specifies three key factors necessary to potentiate collective protest: organizational resources; structure of political opportunities; and cognitive liberation. Activated mass opinion cannot be generated easily by looking to anonymous, private expressions of individuals viewed through regular channels of political participation. It is important to understand the keyroles of resources (whether organizational, as in civil society organizations, or institutionalized, as in social accountability mechanisms), of schemas (whetherframes, more narrowly conceived, or narratives), and of contexts (shifting opportunity structures that disrupt existing power relations and make possible the amplification of voices from below).",

The terminology given in the Glossary of Training, originally published by the Ministry of Labor and still in use today, illustrates this point well. The general definition of training is the methodical development of the attitudes, knowledge, or skill systems required by an individual to carry out a task or job effectively in accordance with the obligations and responsibilities assigned. In this case, education is often combined with additional education. The definition of education, on the other hand, is understood as an effort that seeks to foster moral principles, knowledge, and understanding that are needed at all levels of society.

Along similar lines, commentators point to the decline of traditional party politics and look instead to social media and digital communication as new resources for grassroots mobilisation. So does the communication of apparently trivial matters really hold the seeds to social renewal, or are such ideas romantically over-inflated?",

      "title": "Delinquency as the Failure of Adults and the Village to Exercise Their Moral Strength",
      "abstract": "This paper examines multiple relationships among several concepts to determine common causes to delinquency and to suggest intelligence-based alternative to resolve this public health hazard. Juvenile crime has become a public health hazard because the regularity, brutality and impunity by which juveniles commit their crimes these days is indescribable and their state of mind is “unplaced”. Delinquency may be defined as the behavior consequent to the failure of adults and the village to exercise their moral superiority and integrity to produce behavior that conforms to standards set as norms with some degree of consistency in a society to which legal sanctions are leveled (Obinyan, E. 2011). Adult's moral superiority may be defined as the ability to recognize the differences between acceptable and unacceptable behavior….Adult's moral integrity may be defined as the ability of individual adults to refrain from unacceptable behavior and to communicate to youths through example, conventional acceptable behavior (Obinyan, 2011).Village moral superiority entails the ability of each group, community or the society at large to establish norms that are consistent with cultural values. Village moral integrity entails the ability of the village as a whole to uphold, reinforce, and consistently demonstrate and communicate the sanctity of these cultural norms. Moral strength, therefore is the combined effect of the village and adult’s moral superiority and integrity (Obinyan). Children and youth social contexts are important contributors of problem behavior (Dishion, Forgatch, VanRyzin, &amp; Winter, 2012; Dodge, 1983). In deviant peer groups, it is common for youth to engage in deviancy training wherein deviant behaviors are reinforced such that discussion of rule-breaking behavior is linked with a positive consequence (e.g., affirmation; Dishion, Spracklen, Andrews, &amp; Patterson, 1996). Youth association with deviant peers is associated with many problematic outcomes (e.g., drug use, violence; Dishion, Eddy, Haas, Li, &amp; Spracklen, 1997; Dision, Capaldi, Spracklen, &amp; Li, 1995; Dishion &amp; Patterson, 2006).Delinquency results when there is a relative absence of adult and village action, such as lack of moral integrity and respect for societal norms, a breakdown of unofficial social control and adult and the village inability to agree on the definition of what behavior may be regarded as delinquent. This is why delinquency may be seen as a function of the type of relationships between adults and the village, and their perception of and attitude toward delinquency. For a particular person however, the definition of delinquency may depend greatly upon their cultural background and the inability of the adult and the village to properly use their moral superiority and integrity to impact on all members of their communities. In most cases, the relative weakness of adult and village moral strength should account for the delinquent behavior. When delinquent recidivism becomes a problem and a continuation of delinquent behavior is consistent and intensifies, we would expect that the steam or vitality of adult and village moral strength (moral superiority and integrity) has been let out.",

      "title": "Insight, part of a Special Feature on Exploring Resilience in Social-Ecological Systems Scale Mismatches in Social-Ecological Systems: Causes, Consequences, and Solutions",
      "abstract": "Scale is a concept that transcends disciplinary boundaries. In ecology and geography, is usually defined in terms of spatial and temporal dimensions. Sociological also incorporates space and time, but adds ideas about representation and organization. Although spatial and temporal location determine the context for social and ecological dynamics, social-ecological interactions can create dynamic feedback loops in which humans both influence and are influenced by ecosystem processes. We hypothesize that many of the problems encountered by societies in managing natural resources arise because of a mismatch between the of management and the scale(s) of the ecological processes being managed. We use examples from southern Africa and the southern United States to address four main questions: (1) What is a scale mismatch? (2) How are mismatches generated? (3) What are the consequences of mismatches? (4) How can mismatches be resolved? Scale mismatches occur when the of environmental variation and the of social organization in which the responsibility for management resides are aligned in such a way that one or more functions of the social-ecological system are disrupted, inefficiencies occur, and/or important components of the system are lost. They are generated by a wide range of social, ecological, and linked social-ecological processes. Mismatches between the scales of ecological processes and the institutions that are responsible for managing them can contribute to a decrease in social-ecological resilience, including the mismanagement of natural resources and a decrease in human well-being. Solutions to mismatches usually require institutional changes at more than one hierarchical level. Long-term solutions to mismatch problems will depend on social learning and the development of flexible institutions that can adjust and reorganize in response to changes in ecosystems. Further research is needed to improve our ability to diagnose, understand, and resolve mismatches in linked social- ecological systems.",

In both cases, ceremony and protocol tell the different types of public both how they should appear to the group and what their spatial-temporary positions are in the relational imaginary of the event, a position given by the types of relation established beforehand by public relations and that are shown on the basis of the system of bonds in that organizational universe.",

      "abstract": "Social workers are increasingly becoming global professionals, both in utilising their professional qualifications as a means to achieve international mobility, and in the expectation of gaining an internationally transferable set of skills. However, there is a continued dilemma in defining such professional international identity due to contradictory processes of ‘indigenisation’, or the extent to which social work practice fits local contexts; ‘universalism’, finding commonalities across divergent contexts; and ‘imperialism’ where western world-views are privileged over local and Indigenous cultural perspectives (Gray, 2005). Many regard social work to be especially context-sensitive in that a good understanding of language and cultural clues is an essential element in the ability of workers to perform their work effectively. In that sense, while global professional mobility facilitates transnational social work (Hanna and Lyons, 2014), social work is not yet a global ‘common project’ and clear differences remain at the level of training, qualifications and practice (Weiss-Gal and Welbourne, 2008; Hussein, 2011, 2014).",

In the different shapes it can assume, unrest can be a factor for transformation and social progress and can give rise to social movements and demands for change shared by broad sectors of society. However, it can also generate apathy or political disaffection when the underlying discontent is not expressed in a structured way through specific demands. Similarly, the failure of governments and institutions to respond to unrest, or their failure to provide sustainable responses, can generate major tensions, conflict and instability. Addressing the factors that fuel unrest is therefore essential to avoid increasing levels of conflict, outbreaks of violence and crises of representation and democratic legitimacy, all of which hinder economic performance (ECLAC, 2018).",

Until recently only a few worldwide personality datasets have been available. The first large–scale studies indicate that the pattern of covariation between personality traits is universal and is relatively easily generalizable across languages and cultures. In contrast to the structure of personality, the comparison of the mean trait scores across cultures is much more problematic because cross–cultural differences turned out to be very small in their magnitude, about one–third of the magnitude of individual differences within culture. More integral (e.g., the similarity between personality profiles) or subtle (e.g., the disparity between positively and negatively worded items) measures can reveal more systematic relationships with relevant socioeconomic and geographic variables than the mean scores themselves. Relatively modest sizes of cross–cultural differences in the mean values may imply that a reasonable scalar equivalence can be achieved, and all individuals, irrespective of their language and culture, can be represented in a common metric.",

In contrast, the sociology of social problems defines social problem differently and adopts a different analytic approach. This approach—sometimes called constructionist—defines social problem in terms of a process, rather than a type of condition. It focuses on how and why people come to understand that some conditions ought to be viewed as a social problem, that is, how they socially construct social problems. Typically, the social problems process begins with claimsmakers who make claims that some condition ought to be considered a problem, that this problem should be understood in particular ways, and that it needs to be addressed. Other people respond to those claims and rework them, so that the social problem is constructed and reconstructed by the media, the general public, policymakers, the social-problems workers who implement policy, and critics that assess the policy’s effectiveness. The process is complex: some claims produce a speedy reaction, while others have difficulty finding an audience. The constructionist approach began to guide researchers in the 1970s and has generated a substantial literature that continues to develop in new directions.",

Despite mounting pressure to value social and cultural contexts of learning, popularised models of children's artistic development suggest that young children decline in artistic capabilities with the onset of school, primarily as a result of social interactions—a U-shaped model of artistic development (Davis, 1991; Gardner, 1982). Furthermore, children are often invisible in discussions on children's art and the value placed on their art is closely aligned with adults' aesthetics (Pariser &amp; van den Berg, 2001) while marginalising children's actual experiences. Why beliefs about early childhood art remain entrenched may be best understood by exposing the intersection of the ever-evolving notions of childhood, art and child development.",

This is particularly about educational, economic, political, religious and leisure institutions in which people from different age groups and generations play different roles and occupy different positions. Age integration is based on the assumption that access to the institution, the possibility of exiting it and access to products (called outputs); services implemented in reality and benefits and outcomes paid out; the effects of implemented services and services, eg reduction of poverty, improvement of health, activities of these institutions is equal for all regardless of age.\r\n\r\nPolish abstract: Integracja wiekowa - termin stosowany w gerontologii spolecznej w przynajmniej dwoch znaczeniach.

      "title": "Workshop: Cohorts: coordinated tools for decision support",
      "abstract": "Abstract Longitudinal cohorts, by allowing to follow over the time a group of persons with common characteristics to identify the occurrence of health events, have proven to be very valuable instruments in medical and public health research. For instance, it is possible to investigate links between exposures (demographic, biological, behavioral, environmental, or genetic) and the occurrence of observed health events. And indeed the applications of the cohorts are multiple: besides public health research (links between risk factors or exposures and disease, health effects of unusual or still unknown exposures), it is possible, for example, to investigate the impact of a therapeutic strategy or complex healthcare intervention on the population status. Therefore, observations resulting from cohort studies are now often at the heart of public policy decision-making. In addition, health-data collections are increasingly broad in our societies (data from research, care, patient communities, or using personal initiatives such as smartphone applications and connected objects) and heterogeneous (genomic, physiological, biological, clinical, social and environmental). However, the efficiency of these epidemiological studies is limited by many factors, while resources required to develop them are very important. The lack of knowledge of the European landscape, the lack of harmonization of practices or governance or the lack of communication between various stakeholders, have an impact on the strategy to adopt. It would be essential to consider procedures to optimize resources, harmonize methodologies and coordination between structures, in such a context where epidemiological expertise is sometimes scarce and under-resourced. Furthermore, possibilities of international cross-cohorts linkages and collaborations could allow for unique and fruitful research opportunities, impossible to achieve in the setting of a stand-alone cohort. During this workshop, we propose to present different European initiatives and coordination models, but also to highlight collaborations between these cohorts. This brainstorming would allow us 1) to expose methodologies and best practices, which are developed by the various stakeholders; 2) to identify common or transposable procedures in order to participate in sustainable European strategy and at last, to address the challenges of developing future cohorts and using personal health data. For this purpose, four speakers will present the French landscape developed over the past ten years and three models of cohort coordination and data mining in Europe: the French cohort Constances, the Swedish consortium Cohorts.se and the German National Cohort. Each participant will speak for 15 minutes. Then the chairperson will lead the workshop’s joint discussion with the four speakers and the audience. Key messages cohorts are one of the reference instruments for epidemiological and public health research, and represent a significant advantage in decision support. efforts are need to improve the coordination of these cohorts, both nationally and internationally, to sustain these expensive instruments and foster the development of international collaborations.",

      "title": "Better Understanding, Better Interventions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Basing public policy choices and institutional designs on neoclassical assumptions of unbounded rationality can be misleading. A better understanding of how humans think and act will lead to better interventions. Social contexts matter. Thus, policy and institutional prescriptions need to be context-specific and cannot be simply transplanted as ‘best practice’ from elsewhere. The relentless grind of poverty imposes a disproportionately unfair cognitive tax on the poor. It narrows the frame of choices they believe are open to them, and so they often choose inferior options. Encouragingly, better choices result from institutional interventions which alleviate such stresses. Research in psychological and behavioural sciences shows that ‘bounded’ humans could sometimes use help in their complex decision-making process, a nudge. By the very nature of their evolution, norms and mental models have long staying power. They can have the positive effects of the collective knowledge and wisdom of the ancestors being bequeathed to successive generations. But they can also outlive their relevance and become counterproductive. Changing norms need collective actions. Participatory deliberations, empowering the affected people, raising social awareness, or offering a counter norm to anchor the change are some such possible actions. Actions by the government and the deployment of a law can also shift norms. Changing mental models are usually more difficult since they are self-enforced. However, with better understanding of these behavioural aspects, societies can devise better institutional interventions, hopefully leading to a better world.",

      "title": "Shifting boundaries: gender, labor, and new information and communication technology",
      "abstract": "To speak of labor is to tap into a convoluted root system of entangled meanings.\nThe word “labor” is associated both with the aﬃrmative exertion of giving birth and\nwith the expenditure of physical eﬀort on other activities, including the punishment\nof “hard labor.” It also has more abstract collective connotations (as in “division of\nlabor,” “organized labor,” or “labor movement”). Linking the concept to that of\ncreativity adds new dimensions of complexity. A “work” can be a triumphant artistic achievement (a painting, a symphony, or a Victorian lady’s needlecraft), but\n“working” can also refer to daily drudgery.\nThe tension between work as autonomous self-expression, work as necessarymaintenance of the self (and others), and work as the requirement to perform\nexternally imposed tasks is one which is played out in the context of (sometimes\ncontested) social relationships. The more coercive these relationships, and the less\npower the worker has to resist this coercion, the less opportunity there is likely to\nbe for autonomy and self-expression. Conversely, the more powerful the social\nposition of the worker, the more likely it is that she or he can bargain for conditions\nthat allow for some self-fulﬁllment through work, or pass the more mundane tasks\ndown the line to other more vulnerable workers. These relationships may, or may not,\nbe relationships of employment, in which work time is traded for money. However,\nwhether this is acknowledged or not, and whether the work is paid or unpaid, these\nsocial relations shaping the character of work are likely to be strongly gendered.\nThe speciﬁc forms that work takes are thus shaped in a dynamic interplaybetween multiple forces: social relations within the household; broader social relations within which these are embedded (including those of class and ethnicity);\nforms of control that are exercised in the immediate employment relationship\n(which may be exercised hierarchically, through peer pressure, or through the design\nof the job itself); and, increasingly, the broader sociopolitical and economic landscape in which this employment relationship is located. This is in turn inﬂuenced by\nadditional factors, including national legislation, cultural traditions, global market\nforces, and the position occupied by the employer in global value chains. Theinstability created by these complex interactions is further impacted by technological\nchange, which introduces a new dimension of volatility, by changing the boundaries\nbetween paid and unpaid work, by changing the skills involved in performing it, and\nby introducing new options for the spatial organization of labor.\nThis chapter teases out some of the interactions of these multiple conﬂictingforces, identiﬁes their gendered character, and outlines how they shape media work\nin the twenty-ﬁrst century. It does this by looking at the shifting of boundaries:\nbetween paid and unpaid work; between the home and the external workplace;\nbetween production and consumption; between workers in diﬀerent occupational\ngroups; and between regions, countries, and continents.",

      "abstract": "The information society and the development of technologies create conditions for the democratization of commemoration, as a result of which the opinion of any citizen and expert (historian, cultural studies scholar) has equal weight in making decisions about what and how to remember in public. The purpose of this article is to highlight the functions that commemorative practices perform in society and to analyze their constructive and destructive potential. The relationship between commemoration and collective memory or history is highlighted, and the mechanism of emotionalization of memory through commemorative practices is analyzed. Using cases from the Ukrainian and world contexts, four social functions of commemorative practices were defined: 1) influence on social cohesion and the formation of collective identities, 2) influence on the normative value system, 3) ensuring intergenerational communication and preservation of traditions, 4) legitimization of political power. It was established that depending on the circumstances, the degree of participation in the formation and reproduction of commemorative practices by state institutions, the public and professionals (historians and specialists in the field of collective memory and memorialization), commemorative practices can contribute to social cohesion, solidarity, development of civil society, the formation of national identity, transformations of the normative value system, decolonial processes, the creation of a continuous tradition, intergenerational communication, public discussions about the past and its understanding, public involvement in democratic and political processes, and vice versa — to pose a threat to national security through the creation of regional identities, exacerbating memory conflicts, creating memory gaps, adding artificial \"implants\" of memory, combining the present with alien traditions, instrumentalizing and viponizing memory. The results of the research are of practical importance for memorialization experts, museum workers, sociologists, cultural scholars, journalists, art critics, representatives of public organizations and state authorities.",

      "abstract": "Researchers need to observe complex problems from various angles and contexts to create workable, effective and sustainable solutions. For complex societal problems, including health and socioeconomic disparities, cross-sectoral collaborative research is crucial. It allows for meaningful interaction between various actors around a particular real-world problem through a process of mutual learning. This collaboration builds a sustainable, trust-based partnership among the stakeholders and allows for a thorough understanding of the problem through a solution-oriented lens. While the created knowledge benefits the community, the community is generally less involved in the research process. Often, community members are engaged to collect data or for consultancy and knowledge dissemination; however, they are not involved in the actual research process, for example, developing a research question and using research tools such as conducting focus groups, analysis and interpretation. To be involved on these levels, there is a need for building community capacity for research. However, due to a lack of funds, resources and interest in building capacity on the part of both researchers and the community, deeper and meaningful involvement of community members in research becomes less viable. In this article, we reflect on how we have designed our programme of research-from involving community members at different levels of the research process to building capacity with them. We describe the activities community members participated in based on their needs and capacity. Capacity-building strategies for each level of involvement with the community members are also outlined.",

      "abstract": "Complex intervention framework is extensively used in health service delivery, community, health and social policy, such as education, with important health outcomes. Such interventions are sensitive and flexible to the regional context and culture. Complex interventions introduce the use of two or more information sources or two or more research methods to answer a research question.[1,2]\r\n\r\nUsing more than two research methods with triangulation techniques increases the validity of the research findings. Such studies are considered as mixed methods.[2] Complex intervention framework includes the steps which are not necessarily linear and there is also no clear boundary between simple and complex interventions. Such steps include plan development, feasibility and pilot, evaluation, and implementation. These steps have no linear or cyclic order.[3]\r\n\r\nThis framework emphasizes that any intervention should be presented to the patients tailored to the context and culture of that society (political, social, and geographical). Even if the intervention can be presented equally in different societies, the context of that society cannot be ignored in the face of the intervention because one intervention may have different effects on two different societies. In fact, this framework introduces the mechanisms which are sufficiently relevant to that society in order to achieve some changes. In addition, the context of the society after the intervention should be considered in interpreting the findings.[4] Meanwhile, Lakshman et al. considered the use of this framework to infants' nutritional behaviors in lactation with the analysis of cost-effectiveness of a complex intervention in his study as a challenging, long and costly intervention. He even suggested conducting interventional research with or without a framework to evaluate their effectiveness alongside costs.[5]",

      "title": "Spraakverwarring over participatie",
      "abstract": "Confusion between tongues about participation “Participation” is a popular word in Dutch local policy, even more since the introduction of the Social Support Act (Wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning) and Participation Act (Wet participatiebudget). Using the same word, both laws refer to different types of participation. Participation has different meanings, dependent on the actor and context of the participation. This article describes some of the meanings, and usages, of the concept of participation. Based on the context five main types of participation should be distinguished: economic, political, educational, societal and social participation. Different disciplinary approaches and policy goals can value one type of participation “higher” than another type; this can be concluded from several “participation ladders”. Discussions on participation often have this normative character. Policymakers should realize that this norm comes forth from their own policy goals and thus their own system. The word participation itself has an inherent institutional or system character. To avoid confusion between tongues, policymakers should specify actor and context with the word participation, and rather avoid using the word “participation” at all. Other words that can be used instead are: to want, to be able to, and to be allowed to contribute to, to profit from. Spraakverwarring over participatie In de beleidspraktijk van gemeenten ontstaat gemakkelijk spraakverwarring rond het begrip “participatie”. Diverse gemeentelijke afdelingen hebben ermee te maken, onder andere door de Wet participatiebudget of de Wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning. Toch heeft participatie uiteenlopende betekenissen, afhankelijk van actor en context van de participatie. In dit artikel wordt een schets gegeven van de uiteenlopende betekenissen en het uiteenlopende gebruik van het begrip participatie. Op basis van de context worden vijf hoofdtypen onderscheiden: economische participatie, politieke of beleidsparticipatie, onderwijsparticipatie, maatschappelijke en sociale participatie. Vanuit verschillende disciplines en beleidsdoelstellingen gezien kan de ene vorm van participatie “hoger” worden geacht dan de andere vorm; dat is bijvoorbeeld zichtbaar in diverse participatieladders. Het spreken over participatie is daarmee al snel normatief geladen: uit de participatieladder blijkt een voorkeur voor de ene vorm van participatie boven de ander. Het is van belang dat beleidsmakers zich realiseren dat deze norm voortkomt uit hun systeemwereld, en dat het spreken over participatie op zich al sterk een institutioneel of systeemkarakter met zich meedraagt. Om spraakverwarring te voorkomen is het daarom beter dat ze het woord participatie vermijden en andere woorden gebruiken die preciezer weergeven wat ze bedoelen. Dat betekent dat ze in elk geval de actor en context specifiek benoemen. Het woord participatie kan vervangen worden door woorden als: willen, kunnen of mogen bijdragen aan of delen in.",

      "abstract": "Unipolar major depression ranks among the leading contributors to the global burden of disease. Although established risk factors for depression include a variety of individual-level characteristics, neighborhood etiologic factors have been relatively understudied, with several such attributes (neighborhood socioeconomic status, physical conditions, services/amenities, social capital, social disorder) possessing plausible linkages to depression. Using the PubMed database (1966–2008) and the Social Sciences Citation Index database (1956–2008), the author undertook a systematic review of the published literature on the associations between these characteristics and depression in adults. Across studies, the evidence generally supports harmful effects of social disorder and, to a lesser extent, suggests protective effects for neighborhood socioeconomic status. Few investigations have explored the relations for neighborhood physical conditions, services/amenities, and social capital, and less consistently point to salutary effects. The unsupportive findings may be attributed to the lack of representative studies within and across societies or to methodological gaps, including lack of control for other neighborhood/non-neighborhood exposures and lack of implementation of more rigorous methodological approaches. Establishing mediating pathways and effect-modifying factors will vitally advance understanding of neighborhood effects on depression. Overall, addressing these gaps will help to identify what specific neighborhood features matter for depression, how, and for whom, and will contribute to curtailing the burden of disease associated with this major disorder.",

All examine processes – omnipresent though often informal and taken-for-granted – that undergird social organization, noticed more in their absence than presence.

      "abstract": "Societal problems represent both opportunities and challenges for organiza-tions. Issues such as poverty, climate change, and inequality can be seen either as a burden or as a source of innovation. Multinational Corporations, Non-Profit Organizations (NGOs), Cooperatives and Social-Purpose Organizations have engaged in projects that can tackle some of these major societal issues. As con-sequence, a debate around social innovation has emerged. Social innovation is broadly defined as the emergence of new social, organi-zational and institutional arrangements or new products and services designed to address aspirations, to meet needs, or to bring about a solution to a social challenge. Social innovation aims to change social relations and may lead to social transformation (Centre de Recherche sur les Innovations Sociales, 2016). Although it has long existed as a field of practice, the theoretical aspects of social innovation still lag behind the practice, a situation that may keep academia and organizations from making the best of it (Nicholls, Simon, & Gabriel, 2015). More recently, centers dedicated to the study and the practice of social innovation have been created all around the world and represent now an active source of know-ledge on the topic. As an emergent field, scholars from multiple disciplines have been trying to define and theorize social innovation from different perspectives, generating a prolific, and sometimes confusing, literature on the topic. When proposing this special issue, our aim was to invite scholars to engage in this debate and connect with authors and literature internationally developed. Our intention was not to stand for one specific view on social innovation, but instead, to encourage diversity. We sought to stimulate cross-fertilization between the Brazilian context and the international advances in the field. In response to our call for papers, authors from Latin America (Mexico, Brazil), Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy, France) and India submitted their manu-scripts. We considered that nineteen out of thirty papers received fitted the scope of the special issue and presented the minimum standard of quality required by RAM. These papers were submitted to double blinded review. When the first",

Findings suggest that (1) room attendants build a politicised collective identity on Facebook, which functions as both an online community of coping and a locus of politicisation and micro-mobilisation, and (2) online politicisation of collective identity happens in online/offline interplay with the process of consensus mobilisation around the room attendants’ issues (grievances), the social capital accumulated within intragroup and intergroup networks (social embeddedness) and the expectation of changing conditions and/or policies through protest (efficacy).",

      "abstract": "If one adopts the formation of a Human socialized (Homo socialis) to be one of the human cognitive evolution vectors, then an intermediary, a negotiator, or a broker can be considered as its embodiment in the contemporary society. The role of the mediator in the implementation of social interactions can be clearly described by using network analogies, i.e. the society can be represented as a social network, its nodes are associations of people (groups, cliques or clusters) linked by bridges i.e. stronger or weaker connections. Any person forms connec tions (bridges) with many various groups and this is through these bridges that information and resources are being exchanged. A group taken as a whole has fewer contacts with other groups than the individual, so there are always struc tural holes between groups. These holes become especially apparent when there is a need to establish intergroup communication. Here some particular members of the groups come into play who have connections with members of the target group, however weak those links were and who have won the trust of that target members, i.e. possess the social capital. Moreover, people occupying positions at the intersections of the weak connections of social groups get an opportunity to see, realize and use new good ideas. To achieve it, the negotiator must have high cognitive abilities that allow him/her to see opportunities in the situations where others see only structural holes. However, the structural power of the negotiators does not make them leaders of social groups, because they cannot both influence the agenda and at the same time openly pursue their own goals without compromising their status of impartial intermediaries. The revealed features of negotiators, or social brokers, are of particular interest from the point of view of their participation in social engineering techniques in order to increase the effectiveness of social interaction in economically significant projects.",

At the same time, these programs exist and are embedded within specific social, cultural and historical contexts which impact program development, implementation, and eventual outcomes. Evaluations that attempt to address responsiveness to contextual and cultural specificity are often referred to as culturally competent, culturally responsive, inclusive, multicultural, or cross-cultural, among other terms. While there are no agreed upon terminologies, definitions, or even methodologies, what these approaches all share is the recognition that culture and context matter, and that there are no universally agreed upon rules or abstractions that can be applicable in all contexts (Guba &amp; Lincoln, 2005). The recognition of culture and context thus becomes “an explicit criterion rather than an unspoken expectation” (SenGupta, Hopson, &amp; Thompson-Robinson, 2004, p. 15) in evaluations of this type.",

      "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a foundational mechanism of human cooperation. Existing models of indirect reciprocity fail to robustly support social cooperation: image scoring models fail to provide robust incentives, while social standing models are not informationally robust. Here we provide a new model of indirect reciprocity based on simple, decentralized records: each individual's record depends on their own past behavior alone, and not on their partners' past behavior or their partners' partners' past behavior. When social dilemmas exhibit a coordination motive (or strategic complementarity), tolerant trigger strategies based on simple records can robustly support positive social cooperation and exhibit strong stability properties. In the opposite case of strategic substitutability, positive social cooperation cannot be robustly supported. Thus, the strength of short-run coordination motives in social dilemmas determines the prospects for robust long-run cooperation.",

      "abstract": "Do individuals have moral duties to fulfil all the demands of their jobs? In this paper, we discuss how to understand such 'occupational duties' and their normative bases, with a specific focus on duties that go beyond contractually agreed upon duties. Against views that reduce occupational duties to contractual duties, we argue that they often have greater moral weight, based on skills, roles, and the duty of social cooperation. We discuss what it would take to make sure that individuals are not unfairly overburdened by such occupational duties, distinguishing between choice conditions (voluntariness, availability of alternatives, full information) and conditions concerning the role and the social structures within which such duties are embedded (feasible role design, existence of support structures, employee voice). These conditions, however, are not fulfilled for many existing jobs, especially for jobs typically occupied by structurally disadvantaged groups such as women or ethnic minorities. This leads to a dilemma between the claims of those who depend on the occupational duties to be fulfilled, and the rights of those who hold these occupations and are unfairly overburdened. We conclude by arguing for the need for structural reform to dissolve this dilemma.",

Tambien suele existir coincidencia a la hora de senalar los factores que justificarian el escaso desarrollo y una repercusion negativa en los modelos avanzados de reforma o en «tercera fase», como se denominan aquellos en los que se postula «una nueva manera de entender el manejo de la enfermedad mental, las relaciones de los enfermos psiquiatricos con la sociedad y la provision de las medidas asistenciales precisas para satisfacer sus necesidades». Los dos factores principales serian: 1) El insuficiente desarrollo en la comunidad de estructuras o dispositivos intermedios y de apoyo, asi como de programas de rehabilitacion y acogida de los pacientes, y 2) Notoria insuficiencia de las formas mas propiamente comunitarias de actuacion como puede ser la continuidad de cuidados (expresada en la intervencion en crisis, visitas domiciliarias, etc.) A estos factores citados habria que anadir la insuficiencia de la clinica y de las clasificaciones que, aunque persistente y tenazmente negada, importa senalar por el sesgo que conlleva su utilizacion. Y es que un grupo importante de nuestros usuarios son pacientes graves con variadas categorias diagnosticas, cuyos sintomas son suficientemente importantes como para interferir en las capacidades funcionales de la vida diaria: autocuidado, relaciones sociales y laborales, aprendizaje, ocio, etc. Esa gravedad puede amortiguarse o agudizarse dependiendo de la riqueza, densidad y diversidad de la red social en la que estos pacientes estan insertos, pudiendo generar en ellos un mayor o menor grado de afrontamiento, como numerosos estudios han confirmado.

      "abstract": "In recent decades, LGBTQIA+ activism around the world has been calling for more inclusive language creating entirely new non-binary terms or reformulating existing words and grammatical constructions. In Brazil, this claim has recently acquired a relevant role in the official political agenda and has been the object of official actions of refutation and exasperation through bills that seek to prohibit the institutional use of neutral language alleging lack of linguistic, moral and political legitimacy. The focus of this article is on the approach to the issue of neutral language in a social network, Twitter, on metapragmatic nature discussion in the strategic design of the so-called algorithmic Bolsonarism in social networks. As our analysis show, the articulation of contemporary discourses on language and political economy (GAL; IRVINE, 2000) and political activism on network (MALY, 2018; 2020; CESARINO, 2019a; 2019b) is due to school grafocentrism that legitimates the division and ordering of linguistic forms and meanings, correlating them to the division and ordering of social actors between those who speak/can speak because they reproduce institutional conventions of the \"good use\" of language and those who only make noise, in terms of Rancière (1995). Our data come from tweets posted from September to December 2021 and collected through keyword searches that include the expression neutral language.",

Kenmerkend is het unieke karakter, het feit dat kennis over probleemaspecten beperkt is en verschillende perspectieven op een probleem en meerdere waardenoriëntaties een rol spelen. Naast cognitieve en normatieve complexiteit bestaat er ook nog sociale complexiteit. WPs zoals voetbalvandalisme spelen zich af in een beleidsnetwerk met tal van elkaar afhankelijke actoren. Kennis, preferenties, handelingsvermogen en middelen blijken gespreid en niet in de hand van één actor. Om toch tot een bevredigend resultaat te komen moeten de actoren gezamenlijk optrekken. Daarom is interorganisationeel netwerkmanagement en deliberatie met burgers een wenselijke responsestrategie. Bij WPs zijn actoren dus tot elkaar veroordeeld. Centralistische besluitvorming werkt niet. Een centrale actor kan overigens nog wel een rol vervullen als initiator, facilitator of regisseur van overleg en discussie; als arbiter bij botsende perspectieven; of beslisser na netwerkberaad en inbreng van burgers.",

      "title": "Psychological Needs Thwarting and Sustainable Careers",
      "abstract": "Introduction and purpose: Sustainable careers can be defined as “sequences of career experiences reflected through a variety of patterns of continuity over time, thereby crossing several social spaces, characterized by individual agency, herewith providing meaning to the individual” (Van der Heijden & De Vos, 2015, p.7). This requires ongoing self-regulation; by pursuing needs and avoiding frustrations in a proactive and selective way with the aim to protect and promote one's development, well-being and productivity. According to the self-determination theory (SDT), individuals are intrinsically proactive, self-regulating and inherently inclined to development and integrated functioning. For optimal functioning, need satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, is required. Failure to satisfy any of these needs will be manifested in diminished growth, integrity and well-being. Even worse, need thwarting is associated with greater ill-being and more impoverished functioning. SDT further states that psychological needs satisfactions and frustrations vary within persons, over time, context and social interactions. Factors or events, alone or in interaction, that generate variations in need satisfaction or frustration, will also produce variations in activity, self-regulation, and well-being. In line with SDT, it is useful in the context of sustainable careers, to study how personal and contextual events and changes, as well as their interconnectedness, over the life span, influence need satisfaction or frustration, and what consequences this has for activity, integration, and well-being towards sustainable careers. Therefore, this qualitative study explores how (non-)sustainable careers have developed over time, and which factors and their mutual relationships have influenced them. Design, Methodology and Results Data will be collected by means of semi-structured interviews with employees of a Dutch care organization. The results are expected in the winter of 2018. Qualitative content analyses will be applied. Discussion The results of this study can help to further understand the development of (non-)sustainable careers. The presented study is retrospective, which has as disadvantage that the reliability of memories is debatable. This study is to our knowledge the first to generate insights in personal and contextual factors over time, in relation to sustainable careers, grounded in self-determination theory, and may as such, offer relevant directions for further research on sustainable careers and SDT.

From this starting point, the hypothesis would seek, in a plausible way, to answer this interrogation: ?is it possible to develop mechanisms of identity construction and preservation after, from a social point of view, catastrophic situations (wars, dictatorships, natural catastrophes, terrorist attacks)? The hypothesis presented as a set of reflections comes to respond in an affirmative way: it is possible to produce or reconstruct meaning strategies after social trauma or catastrophe but neither in its totality (the representation and the reparation will always be partial) nor under the circumstances in which it was used to do it before the catastrophe (other agents and processes participate like, for instance, those considered as experts).",

It 'will remain an abstract and affirmative concept, of little use in theory and research of social problems in the widest sense' (Baars et al., 1997).

This process of emergence of both personal subjectivities and societies’ systems of values, prejudices, and other social representations is based on the actions of real human beings (Valsiner, 2003a, 2003b). It cannot be reduced to the psychological functioning of any individual or a population of individuals.

Other times, however, we find ways to collaborate on the fly, without rules or norms, or even explicit communication. This often requires inferring a joint plan—imagining “what coordination would we agree to, if we could?”—and playing our surmised role. Is it also considered morally wrong to violate an inferred joint plan? In five preregistered experiments (n = 1,506), we show that deviating from an inferred joint plan is perceived as morally problematic, even without prior communication or agreement. In other words, just as the agreements we actually make are morally binding, so too are the patterns of conduct that we infer our social partners would agree upon.",

This book originated from a report commissioned during the Luxemburg Presidency of the EU, to assess the progress made at the half-way stage in terms of social inclusion since the Lisbon Summit in 2000, which had set objectives and targets to be achieved within a decade. The concept of social inclusion is a complex one. It focuses on participation, but the ability to participate itself is inherently connected with poverty. Deprivation and social exclusion (low income or lack of opportunities to participate effectively in society) are thus multidimensional concepts. ‘People are excluded not just because they are currently without a job or income, but also because they have little prospects for the future or for their children’s future’ (p. 3). This suggests that social inclusion or exclusion is also about hope (or the lack of it). Chapter 5 of this book does indeed look at core factors and indicators that should be used in the EU Social Inclusion Process, albeit hope isn’t one of the non-monetary factors (pp. 174–9) addressed—perhaps because it cannot be readily measured.",

They are not mutually exclusive responses: thus, the market is the archetypal exit mechanism, yet it usually involves voice. When available jointly, exit and voice may reinforce or undercut each other: the exit option enhances the influence of customers’ voice on an unsatisfactory supplier but also reduces its volume. Exit–voice analysis has been applied to trade unions, hierarchies, public services, migration and political action, political party systems, marriage and divorce, and adolescent development.",

      "title": "CULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT",
      "abstract": "textabstractDiscourses on culture and development vary according to their conceptions of culture and of development and according to their standpoint. The ‘culture and development’ problematic has typically: (1) arisen from a conception of ‘culture’ as a relatively fixed, homogeneous set of mental programmes (categories, frameworks, images, values, norms) shared by members of a population; (2) contained an instrumental concern with how far such ‘cultures’ impede or promote ‘development’, largely conceived of as economic growth; and (3) involved outsiders looking at another group or country and seeking relatively simple explanations for perceived development success or failure. All three features are problematic. Alternatives exist, however, in each respect.\r\nThis entry refers to conceptions of culture, discourses about the implications of cultures and cultural dynamics for development, and ethical issues that arise when values clash and the value-content of ‘development’ is seen as dependent on culture. It questions the style of discourse in which developers seek to encapsulate the nature of ‘others’ yet rarely treat their own culture(s) so simply.\r\nCultural diversity is quite often ignored in social science, not least in development economics. People are presumed to be everywhere the same in perceptions and values, or those are considered superficial phenomena with expressive but not causal roles. Most conceptions of culture are less shallow than this, but vary in their degree of adequacy. Culture discourses reject the theory that all people behave identically as calculating acquisitive individuals, and treat sceptically claims that there are universally attractive and appropriate methods of governance and management. Van Nieuwenhuijze inverted economists’ presumption and proposed that ‘everything must be taken as culture-specific until it is proven to be general’ (1986, p. 107) rather than the reverse.",

      "title": "The Role of Vocational Education and Training in Enhancing Social Inclusion and Cohesion",
      "abstract": "Social inclusion and social cohesion are two dominant themes in vocational education and training (VET). They are important policy objectives of the Lisbon goals. In this contribution we explore the relationship between cohesion, exclusion and VET with particular reference to exploratory new research using the European and world values survey. Separate traditions of social inclusion and cohesion have in the past (and more recently) been part of discussions of the concept of vocational socialisation which presents one important way in which VET can jointly contribute towards inclusion and cohesion within societies. In our introduction we chart the historical and contemporary ways in which societies have attempted to reconcile cohesion and inclusion through various forms of VET and socialisation. There appears to be a movement away from socialisation towards competence approaches to VET which may emphasise narrow forms of inclusion, through employability. In short, VET has many potential benefits for societies beyond narrow labour-market functions – although these remain important. Whether these benefits are enacted or not depends on the place of VET for social inclusion within a national welfare system. The obverse of social inclusion is social exclusion – a contested concept. Social exclusion is a multi-dimensional variable which has different meanings across national systems of education. Using exploratory evidence from the latest sweeps (2000-02) of the European and world values surveys we consider that an outcome-based approach to social exclusion (based on objective lived experiences) is superior to a taxonomic categorisation (based on household composition or other descriptive variables). Taking an outcome-based approach to social exclusion we examine the dynamics of exclusion in five countries (Norway, Poland, Portugal, England and the US) showing that VET can sometimes (but not universally) protect against certain forms of exclusion. However, this evidence needs to be supported by further work using other surveys. In particular, longitudinal and labour force surveys would be useful. Our quantitative analysis is supported through policy analysis which critically examines the ability of VET to meet the needs of the socially excluded. In this analysis, we also consider the experiences of immigrants and the disabled in VET who we find are particularly marginalised from mainstream VET provision. Our conclusions are that targeting VET towards specific",

      "title": "Leading Global Product Development Teams",
      "abstract": "More and more firms face the need to access a critical resource for new product development--people who are dispersed around the world. Not only are these new-product developers separated by time and distance but they are separated by cultural and language differences as well. The challenge for their leaders is to integrate and coordinate these individuals and their activities by forming global teams of nationals from a variety of countries. Like other types of product development teams, global teams experience the challenge of getting a diverse group of individuals from different functional areas to work together effectively for a finite period of time to accomplish specific project objectives. These teams must build trust among team members, meet schedules and adhere to budget guidelines. Global product development teams face additional challenges, however: physical distance, cultural diversity, language barriers, and technological infrastructure differences. And, because global team members are from different countries, they are unlikely to know one another, may never meet or else meet infrequently, may be more or less fluent in the team's language, and are likely to have strikingly different work, communication and decision-making norms (1). In light of the critical role that global teams play in NPD, it is surprising that our understanding of how to manage them effectively has not kept pace with their increasing use. While this may simply reflect the difficulty of managing teams whose members are scattered across the globe, developing an appreciation of how to manage these teams is critical (2,3). Firms that fail to develop this capability may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. To close this gap in our understanding, we undertook a study that sought to understand why companies use global teams, the challenges that managers and project leaders face in leading global teams, and the practices that they use to do so successfully (See How the Study Was Conducted, next page). Global Team Usage The managers we surveyed indicated that there were four principal reasons for using global teams: 1. To address global markets/customers by identifying common product platforms.--Two competing needs have driven the increasing use of global teams. On the one hand is the need to develop a global product, i.e., one that can be sold in a number of countries with little customization. As one respondent noted, Product definition and market attractiveness needs to be global--the regional/country mindset must be replaced by global priorities. For these managers, the value of global teams lies in their ability to identify a common product platform that will appeal to customers in many different countries. 2. To identify and incorporate unique needs and requirements of local markets.--On the other hand is the need for products tailored to the unique needs and requirements of a local market. Because they are from different countries and cultures, the inputs and insights of global team members can be used to identify and incorporate the market needs and requirements of their different countries into a new product. The beauty of a global team is that, properly managed, these insights can not only be used to identify different needs, but to develop common product platforms. Thus, global teams can implement two different yet potentially complementary marketing strategies. 3. To capitalize globally distributed Centers of Excellence.--Global teams allow a company to leverage expertise that exists in different countries, rather than attempting to collect that expertise at a single by relocating team members. Not only does this save enormous costs, but it also saves wear and tear a team member's personal life. 4. To bring together dispersed resources.--By bringing individuals together virtually, global teams allow companies to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs in one country, the central location of a distribution center in another, research skills in still another, and on site sales offices. …",

Some aspects of the definition of a pidgin are purely linguistic (e.g. reduction and simplification), but even the crucial quality of stability is claimed to depend on the sociolinguistic factor of tertiary hybridization.",

      "abstract": "Résumé : L’acceptabilité sociale reste une expression controversée car elle a longtemps été utilisée par les promoteurs pour désigner des stratégies communicationnelles visant à éviter ou à réduire la controverse autour de certains projets. Pourtant, comme d’autres expressions avant elle, le sens que lui donnent les acteurs sociaux a évolué au fil des ans au point que l’expression peut être envisagée comme le lieu d’un véritable travail social concernant les conditions de légitimité des projets. En parallèle, des chercheurs se sont penchés sur les facteurs permettant d’expliquer l’attitude des populations à l’égard des projets ou des décisions publics, ouvrant la voie à une véritable théorisation de l’acceptabilité sociale, qui s’inscrit dans la perspective d’une démocratie plus participative. L’invocation de l’acceptabilité sociale à l’occasion de la pandémie peut être analysée comme discours, mais ne doit jamais se confondre avec l’analyse que peut en faire le chercheur sous le prisme du concept d’acceptabilité sociale. Au Québec, bien que l’expression ait été peu utilisée par les pouvoirs publics, l’anticipation d’une adhésion des populations aux mesures sanitaires fut un élément déterminant du niveau de restrictions imposé, ce qui s’explique aisément : sans acceptabilité sociale, les mesures n’auraient pas été respectées et seraient donc devenues inopérantes. Il s’agissait donc d’une condition première de leur effectivité.",

      "title": "The Ambivalence of Blurred Boundaries: Where Informality stops and corruption begins?",
      "abstract": "For years, I have been working on issues of informality. Yet these issues are often also branded as corruption. The research question whether the boundaries between the two can be drawn cannot be answered with help of definitions. Analytical distinctions prove useless in the face of practices emb edded in particular sets of constraints, practical norms and ‘moral economies’ (Olivier de Sardan 1999, 2008). If I am asked to give a one-word clue to identify the missing bit in the puzzle of crossing boundaries between informality and corruption, I would say—ambivalence. In its sociological sense, ambivalence, in the definition of Robert Merton, refers to incompatible normative expectations of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviour. The incompatibility is assigned to a status and the social structures that generate the circumstances in which ambivalence is embedded (Merton 1976: 6-7). The core type of sociological ambivalence puts contradictory demands upon the occupants of a status in a particular social relation. Since these norms cannot be simultaneously expressed in behaviour, they come to be expressed in an oscillation of behaviours: of detachment and compassion, of discipline and permissiveness, of personal and impersonal treatment (Merton 1976: 8).",

      "title": "How do emotional, cognitive and social health resources relate to health behaviour? The case of Lithuania",
      "abstract": "Introduction. In most research studies, health is analysed from the unidimensional perspective, e.g. medical studies are usually based on the biomedical model, which posits that health is an absence of illness, and that illness is caused by abnormality within the body. In this model, mental phenomena are not important, an individual has no or little responsibility on one’s health, and the treatment of a disease in most cases is passive (Wade, Halligan, 2004). The WHO (1948) definition of health suggests that health is not only the absence of illness, but also a good subjective and social state, i.e. health is a multidimensional, biopsychosocial construct. Therefore, alongside the analysis of the biological aspects of health, there is also a need to study the relationship between psychosocial aspects (resources) of health and health behaviour. The aim of the study is to explore the links between different emotional (feelings of depression, sadness, anxiety, happiness), cognitive (beliefs that other people are helpful, supportive, trustful) and social (religiousness, meeting with friends, participation in social activities, possibilities to discuss private, intimate questions) health resources and their relation to health behaviour (eating fruits, vegetables, smoking status, number of cigarettes, alcohol use frequency, amount of alcohol consumed on workdays and weekends, physical activity) in a representative sample of Lithuanian males and females. Research methods and participants. Single-item questions generated by experts from the European Social Survey round 7 were used to assess the emotional, cognitive and social health resources and health behaviour. The research sample (n=1865) was drawn from the general population in Lithuania (40.2 percent of males and 59.8 percent of females). The mean age of participants was 49.59 (SD=18.29). The youngest participant was 15 years old and the oldest one was 92. Participants were interviewed in 2014. [...]",

This is indicative of the fact that there are already a great many businesses, not all of them multinationals either, who are committed to exercising their social responsibility. The fact that an organisation, regardless of its nature, is a dynamic member of its community places heavy demands on the management of the organisation, increasingly, managers are aware that there are gaps in the knowledge and skills they need to effectively steer their organisations through the maze of interrelations and interactions they encounter on every front. Krause highlights the role of public relations education and the Public Relations Council with regard to management requirements. He concludes by stating that the exercise of essential control over what the organisation communicates is increasingly difficult without using the services of competent specialists - including those trained in the discipline of public relations - to help them.",

(2) On account of the stigmatisation, isolation and powerlessness that poor people often experience, societal reactions, e.g. relief or assistance aimed at them, may be vital in establishing poor people as a distinct social category. (3) Poor people are often seen as socially marginalised in the sense that they are unequivocally excluded from society.

      "title": "Social Prevention of Sociopathic Phenomena in the System of Antideviant Policy",
      "abstract": "In modern conditions of the systemic transformation of the Belarusian society, which is developing very slowly and contradictory, despite the steady trend of reducing crime, drunkenness, drug addiction and other negative social deviations, the problem of preventing and combating antisocial phenomena continues to be complex and cause serious public concern. In this regard, the relevance and social significance of empirical studies of antisocial phenomena, their dynamics, the specifics of distribution and determination, the study of the current national legislation and social practice of the state criminological and other antideviant policies are growing. Problems of prevention and counteraction to anti-social phenomena have long attracted the attention of criminologists, sociologists, culturologists, teachers, psychologists and other researchers. However, each historical period of time brings many new circumstances that have an impact on the sociopathic situation. In addition, the persistently high level of antisocial behavior in society in different socio-demographic groups of the population indicates the presence of obvious gaps in the scientific knowledge of this problem, especially in the field of genesis and determination of negative social deviations as well as the lack of effectiveness of the forms and methods of preventive work of social actors, such as law enforcement and other public administration bodies, the family as a social institution, public associations, etc. The author carries out theoretical and applied design of an innovative system of social prevention of antisocial phenomena based on the analysis of statistical data and sociological research. It includes a set of general, special and individual measures of social, victimological and sociopathic, socio-reintegration and legal preventive activities that should be systematically implemented at the social, situational, personality-deviant, personality-victim and personality-socio-interactive levels of social subjectivity. The researcher pays special attention to the state, dynamics and peculiarities of the etiology of the alcohol and drug situation in the country. The authors propose a set of specific social and practical measures to improve the prevention of alcoholism and drug addiction which have a negative impact on the sustainable development of modern Belarusian society.",

      "title": "Social Relations",
      "abstract": "In the preceding chapter on ethnic and cultural orientations, it was pointed out that self-descriptions in terms of ethnic and cultural affiliations are not necessarily connected with actual social practices. Social relations have to be negotiated on the basis of similarities as well as discrepancies, and the very nature of multicultural society dictates that minority groups in particular are unlikely to be completely limited to their own group. This section investigates social integration in terms of social relations such as friendships, social practices such as public participation, and the perception of a general social climate in terms of discriminatory tendencies. When it comes to immigrants, social integration is often associated with notions of assimilation. The assumption here is that the degree of social interaction with the majority population (interethnic contacts, public participation) is indicative of the degree of social integration. It is assumed that the stronger the social orientation of migrants towards their own group, the stronger the degree of ‘ethnic’ segmentation (see Esser 2001). At the same time, an understanding of ‘assimilation’ as the individual and collective orientation towards institutionalised social expectations risks overemphasising immigrants’ obligations towards majority society. This then tends to lead to an underestimation of the importance of actual access to relevant social domains (see Bommes 2004b; Sauer, Halm & Stiftung Zentrum fur Turkeistudien 2009). Opportunities for public participation and forming social relations thus depend not only on the individual abilities and attitudes of both the majorities and the minorities, but also on the inherent uncertainties of complex social systems.",

      "abstract": "Members of religious groups exhibit cultural uniformity in a variety of ways and to different extents. In this paper I discuss the different ways in which this uniformity is achieved, the advantages and disadvantages that cultural uniformity offers a group, and the broader effects of cultural uniformity on cultural evolution. Partial cultural uniformity can come about in different ways, including: (1) selection involving positive and negative feedbacks (e.g., Fisher process); (2) coordinating signals that include hard-to-fake displays; and (3) the imposition of protocols that are necessarily similar enough to enable communication. These processes often interact, resulting in rapid uniformity in some aspects of culture. Once a sufficient level of cultural uniformity is achieved, it has important consequences for the group as a whole and for individual members. These include: (1) credible signaling which is not costly; (2) increased detection of deviant or novel behavior; (3) increased group cohesion and commitment; (4) an agreed-upon central authority that can divide labor and direct group-wide cultural change; and (5) an increase in the rate of adaptation due to cultural group selection. These effects help explain the stability and diversity of religious group practices.",

The present study investigated through six focus groups ( N = 40) how Chinese college students ( M age = 19.6, SD = 1.41, 60% women) made sense of social and moral transgressions (i.e., mistakes) and the strategies they use to self-correct. Mistakes were conceptualized to include violating standards (moral, social, personal) as well as negatively influencing others (causing harm, but also “being a bother” as part of communal living). Participants reported using strategies (mindfulness, seeking assistance) which required making additional effort in everyday life to self-correct. These findings have implications for considering the important role of community and social support in assisting the promotion of college students’ moral agency, so that they may learn from their mistakes.",

The author seeks confirmation of this fact at the level of everyday practices in housing settlements, tracking the mechanisms used by people in situations of contact and confrontation with others in the social space. He sets himself several aims: (1) he attempts to analyze selected spatial practices (parking within the settlement, the creation of belonging), reflecting the internal structuring strategies of housing settlements; (2) he points to the causes of that structuring, that is, the main contexts in which these practices occur and are strengthened; (3) he highlights the important role of space in processes of bordering and differentiation. Practices connected with parking and the creation of belonging, although apparently disparate and deriving from contrary spheres of social life make it possible to hypothesize that the striving for separation and the increased importance of space determine the organization of borders, divisions, and social relations in housing settlements.",

      "title": "Welvaartsfuncties in de landbouw : ontwikkeling en toepassing",
      "abstract": "An individual's well-being (also referred to as welfare or utility) is intimately linked to the extent to which the desires and wishes of that individual are fulfilled, and pain and distress avoided. These desires can relate to various aspects of daily life. Some pertain to economics, others are more sociological in nature. The economic aspect that has received the most attention is income. In this respect income has a very broad meaning: command over commodities. It covers elements such as income distribution, wealth and its distribution, poverty, etc. Closely related to income and income distribution is the division of time between labour and leisure (in some instances also time spent in the household). To a large extent the distribution of time between labour (paid time) and leisure (unpaid time) determines the amount of income an individual can earn, In addition, the choice of a particular job (at least if one has the option of choosing) also has implications regarding the amount of income. Some aspects of life usually considered as belonging to the field of sociology such as health, education, safety, social relations and feelings of fear, have nonetheless received an increasing interest of economists (Becker, 1965; Rosen, 1986).This research concerns income and labour in agriculture. Literature on agricultural economics devides income research into three general categories:-income formation and income distribution in agriculture-comparison of incomes earned inside and outside agriculture - research on the incidence of poverty in rural areas.Research on labour is mainly concerned with:-the quality of jobs: working conditions, education, on-the job-training, etc.-the amount of work done: for example, how many hours a day does a farmer work.In this study a special kind of utility function (Van Praag, 1968) is used to describe farm families' preferences with respect to income and labour. This socalled individual welfare function is a cardinally measurable utility function. This function was originally derived as a lognormal distribution function. Up to now most applications of this special utility function have been aimed at deriving the welfare function of income.The univariate lognormal distribution function is determined by two parameters, μand σ. In order to measure the welfare function of income, that is, to estimate the parameters μand σthe 'Income Evaluation Question' was developed. Under the assumption that utility can be measured directly, respondents to surveys have to specify the amounts of income they associate with verbal qualifications such as 'very bad', 'bad', etc. The parameters of the welfare function can be estimated using those evaluations, making some special assumption about the way those surveyed provide these evaluations (the so-called 'equal interval' assumption). Differences in estimated parameter values can be explained by the differences in economic and demographic background among the people being surveyed.The welfare function of labour is measured in a way that is analogous to the welfare function of income. In the labour evaluation, respondents express their feelings about two different, yet related aspects of labour. First, working on the farm provides 'psychic income' for the workers involved. Therefore, to a certain extent, labour will be evaluated positively. Second, the provision of labour reduces the amount of leisure time available. This aspect of labour provision is evaluated negatively. According to the theory of the welfare function, the evaluation of both aspects of labour can be approximated by a bivariate lognormal distribution function (Van Praag, 1968; Van de Stadt, 1983). The four parameters of this specification are measured similarly to the welfare function of income. Survey respondents are asked to answer the 'Labour Evaluation Question', which indicates a range of hypothetical working hours. The respondent is supposed to give a (numerical) evaluation for the various working hours relevant to him or her. As the bivariate lognormal distribution function is rather demanding as far as the number of parameters to be estimated is concerned, additional specifications such as a gamma and a beta specification were also estimated. Just as with the welfare function of income, differences in parameters can partly be attributed to differences in the respondents' economic and demographic circumstances.Both the welfare function of income and that of labour should be considered partial welfare functions. When evaluating working hours, income is assumed to be constant, whereas the amount of working hours is constant when evaluating different amounts of income. According to the theory of the welfare function, the simultaneous evaluation of income and labour should be specified as the product of the partial welfare functions (at least whenever the aspects evaluated, in this case income and labour, are independent). It will probably be very difficult for a respondent to evaluate an amount of income that is very high (or very low), compared with that respondent's usual income, without (even if implicitly) changing the amount of labour involved. The same is true when evaluating labour. Respondents might relate different amounts of working time to changes in income. This means that any simultaneous evaluation of income and labour based on such partial evaluations can only be valid when conducted within the scope of respondents' own actual labourlincome combinations. In addition to the (theoretically correct) specification as a product of partial welfare functions, the simultaneous evaluation of income and labour has also been specified as the (convex) weighted sum of the partial evaluations.The parameters of the welfare function are estimated using survey results. The answers to the specific evaluation questions (the 'Income Evaluation Question' and the 'Labour Evaluation Question') are particularly relevant in the estimation procedure. For the purpose of estimating the welfare function of farm families in the Netherlands, a small sample of farmers (arable, dairy, intensivelivestock, and others) was chosen from among the Dutch farm population. In addition to answering the evaluation questions, respondents were also requested to provide information about the technical characteristics of their farms and the demographic characteristics of their farm families. Contrary to most previous applications, the evaluation questions were put to both the farmers and their wifes (if present). Although the sample used is certainly not a perfect reflection of the Dutch farm population, the farms selected seem to have provided a reasonable picture of farm type subgroups within the population.As far as the preferences regarding income are concerned, the results broadly correspond to those for the Dutch population. (For results concerning the population at large, see, e.g. Kapteyn, 1977). It generally takes a higher income to satisfy a farmer than it does to satisfy his spouse. This fact has been explained in Kapteyn et al., 1986.Past incomes do affect perceived satisfaction with certain amounts of income in the present. This is the so-called 'preference drift'. Because of the highly fluctuating incomes of farmers, this effect is less pronounced for the farm population than for the average Dutch citizen. Using some kind of permanent income measure that fluctuates less than actual farm incomes, substantially reduces the differences between farmers and nonfarmers.The number of persons in a family can be considered an indication of the costs involved in feeding and clothing the family. Although family size does have a comparable effect on the farmer's income preferences, as in studies covering the Dutch population, family size has a much greater effect on the preferences of the farmer's wife. This is due to the fact that previous research only addressed the income evaluation question to the head of the family, in most cases a man.The welfare function of income can be used to calculate parity incomes for different groups of farmers. Group A earns a parity income compared with group B when both groups are equally satisfied with their incomes. Based upon the (small) sample, intensive-livestock farmers seem to be the most satisfied with their incomes, whereas arable farmers are the least satisfied. In general, farmers seem to be less satisfied with their incomes than the average Dutch citizen. It should be kept in mind however, that this observation is related to the period of the survey. In different circumstances the comparison result could very well be reversed.The evaluation of labour is not monotonically decreasing in time, as is almost always assumed in neoclassical economics. If only a small number of hours is worked on the farm, the perceived sense of well-being increases. If the amount of labour exceeds a certain number of hours, perceived welfare decreases. The increase in perceived welfare is the result of 'psychic income' derived by farmers working their farms. The welfare perception eventually starts decreasing as the amount of leisure time is reduced due to increasing labour time. Various specifications of the welfare function of labour have been estimated. The lognormal specification fit the data best.As with the parameters of the welfare function of income, habit formation determines to some degree the estimated values of the parameters of the welfare function of labour.The combination of the welfare function of income and the welfare function of labour results in the welfare function of income and labour. If both partial evaluations are independent, then the combined welfare function is the product of the partial welfare functions. The cardinality of the welfare function makes it possible to determine the unique welfare levels of the indifference curves.The shape of the indifference curves is different than in the neoclassical case because of the 'psychic income' derived from working, whether it is on the farm or elsewhere.The amount of income needed to persuade a farmer to work an extra hour (the so- called marginal rate of transformation) can be calculated from the estimated welfare function of income and labour. The interpretation of the calculated values is rather difficult. Compared with the values in other research (based on neoclassical assumptions), the calculated rates of transformation based on the welfare- function are very high.Given that farmers would have the same preferences regarding on-farm and off-farm labour, calculations based on neoclassical assumptions show that the on-farm amount of labour for individual farmers is not compatible with utilitymaximizing behaviour. Because farmers are working too many hours, their wage rate, measured by the value of the marginal product, is low. Nonfarming wage rates in 'comparable' jobs are higher. Here farmers could earn a higher income with presumably less labour. One reason why farmers do not leave agriculture is that in the above comparison an incorrect value for the opportunity cost of farm labour is used in calculating off-farm income opportunities. Nonagricultural wage rates for current farmers would be even lower than their agricultural wage rates. There is also the chance that the right kind of jobs (part-time, close to the farm) are not available. Another explanation is that the income measure is too restricted. In addition to providing money, farming also supplies other kinds of income (e.g. housing, home- grown goods, etc.). From this point of view, farmers' incomes would not be (relatively) low as long as all components were adequately assessed. Another explanation takes preferences towards labour into account. It could be that farmers have such preferences (with respect to farm labour), that they are satisfied with a relatively low reward.The results based on the welfare function of income do not confirm explanations concerning income, as such. Farmers are less satisfied with their money income than workers outside agriculture. Obviously non-money income does not fully compensate for the low money reward. When preferences regarding labour and income are simultaneously taken into account, in order to justify an additional hour of work, the wage rate should be substantially higher than the marginal wage rate calculated in previous (neoclassical) research. So, even when preferences towards farm labour are taken into account, it is still impossible to explain the low wage rates in agriculture.The high values for farmers' transformation rates, based on their preferences regarding income and labour, do not fit with the incidence of low agricultural wage rates. One explanation could be that the welfare function should contain other arguments besides income and labour. Or perhaps attention should be paid to nonagricultural circumstances in order to discover why farmers are so reluctant to leave agriculture. Despite the fact that circumstances in agriculture do not concur with farmers' preferences, farmers seem to be trapped in agriculture without any opportunities for leaving and taking a job elsewhere. This inquiry into the preferences of farm families cannot, by itself, provide the ultimate answer to the question of why farmers remain farmers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Intergenerational transfers are the essence of societal continuity, and yet not at all well conceptualized or analysed. Intergenerational transfers are also at the core of the welfare state concept of redistribution of resources and hence, of current social policy changes/challenges. In making a difference to policy choices and in linking research to policy, attention to intergenerational transfers focusses on the fundamental policy questions of guiding belief systems, family (or private) transfers versus public transfers among generations, and issues of intergenerational and cohort equity in the short and longer terms. This paper has four objectives: (1) Situating intergenerational transfers in socio-historical, international comparative, and current social policy contexts; (2) Developing a typology of intergenerational transfers that could provide the basis for answering thus far unanswerable key policy questions, such as whether the situations of seniors into future generations will be like those of seniors today; (3) Encouraging the collection of more complete and integrated data on intergenerational transfers in Canada, which would provide for more informed policy choices; and (4) Enumerating key policy questions that emerge from research and remain to be addressed. From analysis of what is known about intergenerational transfers and what remains to be known, an agenda for an information system, for future research and for addressing policy questions is outlined.",

One major form of mutualism is coordination, in which actors align their choices for mutual benefit. Formal examples include meetings, division of labor, and legal and technological standards; informal examples include friendships, authority hierarchies, alliances, and exchange partnerships. Successful coordination is enabled by common knowledge: knowledge of others’ knowledge, knowledge of their knowledge of one’s knowledge, ad infinitum. Uncovering how people acquire and represent the common knowledge needed for coordination is thus essential to understanding human sociality, from large-scale institutions to everyday experiences of civility, hypocrisy, outrage, and taboo.",

      "abstract": "This thematic issue sheds light on navigations of otherness and relations of mistrust during times of uncertainty and insecurity. These often-tense interactions take many shapes and occur within, as well as across, boundaries set in terms of ethnicity, religion, kinship, gender, political ideology, citizenship status, health risk, and contagion. As the articles in this issue demonstrate, during such uncertain times, people search for ways to negotiate tensions surrounding the relationship between sameness and otherness (Bauman 2001). This involves navigating various challenges, especially when crossing borders or symbolic boundaries, while carefully following the processes involved in creating and maintaining them. Additionally, individuals may have to face inequalities, structural violence, xenophobia, and rising extremism. Furthermore, they may need to negotiate issues of mistrust and risk in contexts of contagion, illness, and (mis)information. And, sadly, many people are forced to navigate the effects of critical events (Das 1995) on their everyday life and social relationships in contexts of conflict and crisis.",

      "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memperoleh pemahaman yang komprehensif tentang anatomi konflik, dan untuk mengidentifikasi pola sebaran konflik menurut wilayah, dampak konflik, dan langkah penanganan pasca konflik dalam konteks pembangunan infrastruktur. Kajian ini menggunakan gabungan pendekatan kualitatif dan kuantitatif. Model gabungan dua pendekatan dengan satu pendekatan dominan secara metodologi ini merujuk kepada model yang disebut dominant-less dominant design of mixed-methodology. Penelitian dilakukan di Kecamatan Way Panji, Natar, Jati Agung, dan Tanjung Sari, mengingat konflik-konflik yang pernah terjadi sebelumnya sudah dapat diselesaikan namun masih dapat dikenang dan berujung pada konflik selanjutnya. Selain itu, setiap kecamatan memiliki klasifikasi konflik yang berbeda (suku, agama, pemerintah, perusahaan, dan dampak pembangunan infrastruktur). Studi ini menemukan bahwa konflik sosial di Kabupaten Lampung Selatan disebabkan oleh kebijakan pembangunan yang mengabaikan kebutuhan dan kepentingan masyarakat setempat. Mekanisme penanganan konflik seringkali kehilangan akar penyebab perselisihan, sehingga sulit untuk diselesaikan. Konflik dapat terjadi dari setidaknya empat sumber: berdasarkan hubungan pribadi, kepentingan ekonomi, perbedaan nilai (misalnya, keyakinan agama, etnis), dan faktor struktural. Faktor-faktor yang menyebabkan terjadinya konflik sosial berbeda-beda, tergantung dari perilaku para aktor yang terlibat. Terkadang konflik antar individu atau kelompok kecil berkembang menjadi konflik antar kelompok yang lebih besar. Kualitas masalah yang dihadapi terkadang dapat menimbulkan konflik antar kelompok. Ini dapat dipicu oleh masalah yang sederhana dan tidak realistis, atau oleh masalah yang lebih realistis dan mendasar. Ketika mencoba menyelesaikan konflik sosial, penting untuk mengikuti prinsip musyawarah dan mufakat. Hal ini dapat dilakukan melalui mediasi. Pemrosesan difokuskan pada penyelesaian konflik yang belum terselesaikan.",

      "abstract": "When people join groups, their personal biases and cognitive biases can lead to extreme herd behaviour, group polarization, and groupthink. Social systems can evolve to better adapt to environmental pressures by developing specialized organizations with legitimate authority. Traditional public deliberation may be less efficient as individuals tend to conform their interpretations to match those of others, rather than their actions, and they may not be aware of alternative possibilities. Evolutionary changes require diversity and independent thinking to adapt based on new information. Regulators need to consider diverse and unshared information to avoid unintended consequences. The degree of collective intelligence is linked to an individual's social sensitivity and ability to think about the mental states of other individuals. Superforecasters, who are open-minded, diverse, and analytical with developed social abilities, can beat individual experts and prediction markets.",

      "title": "THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIETAL CRISES ON SOCIAL INTEGRATION",
      "abstract": "Abstract Societal crises have profound effects on various life domains. So far, the literature has focused on the effects of crises on financial security or health. Effects on social integration, i.e., social relationships and social participation, have received little attention, despite of their relevance for physical and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic brought this topic to the forefront of the scientific and societal debate. However, to date no theoretical framework has been developed that captures the breadth and long-term influence of societal crisis on social integration. This presentation introduces a new theoretical framework – the DIRe-Crises-Model – for analyzing the effects of social crises on social integration, building on the Differential Investment of Resources (DIRe) Model. According to the DIRe-Crises-Model, crises influence social integration via four pathways by: a) limiting the time and energy that can be invested in social relationships, b) restricting the social opportunity structure, c) influencing individual characteristics essential for resource investment, and d) influencing the effects of social relationships (e.g., changes in the experience of loneliness). Dynamic components in the model allow to derive hypotheses on the long-term development of the different effects pathways of crises on social integration. Moreover, social inequalities can moderate the effects of the different pathways of crisis on social integration. The DIRe-Crises-Model as a theoretical framework has the potential to guide empirical analysis on the effects of any given societal crisis on social integration. As such, the framework may help to manage future crises, for example, by stimulating targeted interventions.",

This holds true for the nation‐state concept of public debates as well as for the idea of a global public debate. Ideas on how to transfer the original nation‐state model to a transnational and even global scale are widespread and heterogeneous: the common core concept is that public spheres in modern societies are no longer differentiated by national borders but by issues and the debate of certain issues in specific arenas. On the one hand, such issues could be located on a smaller level (local, regional); on the other the hand, some issues are predestined to integrate different nations or a continent in one debate, for example the European debate about the enlargement of the European Union or the Lisbon‐Contract. These examples show that issues dealing with the institutions of the EU in particular have the ability to establish a transnational debate within that continent.",

Social conflict may arise because of perceived differences in relation to values, needs, goals, interests, rights, positions, or wishes. Many social work roles require the use of conflict management methods, including negotiation, mediation, advocacy, group facilitation, family group conferencing, healing circles, and evaluation. Although social workers incorporate conflict resolution skills in virtually all contexts of practice, advanced conflict resolution theory, strategies, and skills have only been incorporated into the literature of relatively few contexts of practice, for instance, social advocacy, family and divorce mediation, and contracting with involuntary clients. This entry highlights the books and articles contributed by social work scholars and researchers but also includes core conflict resolution works from experts in related disciplines (especially law, management, criminal justice, psychology, and peace and justice studies).",

Dialogue is integral to a number of theoretical perspectives in public relations, from the instrumentalist/functionalist through to the rise of the influence of the two-way symmetric model (Grunig & Hunt, 1984). The emergence of the relational perspective – with its emphasis on dialogue as a means of achieving mutually-beneficial relationships between organisations and stakeholders – brought attention to dialogue as a discrete concept (see, for example, Ledingham, 2003; and 2006). Dialogue continues to be an implicit element in the development of new perspectives on public relations, such as Holtzhausen and Voto’s (2002) postmodern approach...",

      "abstract": "Social work is one of the youngest scientific disciplines, it has developed itself as a discipline to address individuals, families and communities in social crisis (poverty, low level of education, un- employment, diseases, social isolation). In the last decade also problems with alcohol and drug dependencies increasingly became the subject of social work support(systems). Due to coming global- isation, where living space has become wider than the community itself, social work was forced to operate within wider horizons and to go beyond communities boundaries. Social work nowadays has been becoming a more global scientific discipline seeking answers to global questions. Social work is therefore linked to all seventeen global goals of sustainable development (SDGs). As the prevention and treatment of drug addiction in Germany and Central Asia has reached a common urgency, a training and research project in the field of social work in addiction support was developed in Germa- ny, Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan) and China. The development of social work in these countries increasingly led to the development of common principles in the technology and ethics of social work, comparing standards and working out the socio-cultural peculiarities in the definition and practice of social work. These developments are examined and presented and their common solution ideas discussed in the con- text of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",

      "title": "Strategic Planning in a Decentralized Environment: The Death of Linearity.",
      "abstract": "Although private industry has been decentralizing for the past decade, community colleges have been slow to follow. For those colleges that have decentralized, traditional structured planning methodologies do not apply. The focus of strategic planning efforts at decentralized institutions is on the development of strategic themes to which individuals, empowered to use their own creativity, respond. While a formal model for planning in a decentralized institution would inhibit change and be counterproductive, the following ideas can be taken into consideration: (1) an institution must analyze its own identity and functions, rather than rely too heavily on ideas from the corporate sector; (2) routine processes ought to be re-engineered only when appropriate; (3) institutions must buy into the notion of wide-scale collaboration; (4) evolution is normal and is the outcome of decentralized strategic planning; (5) college members must be willing to yield to broader concerns even as they recognize that institutional interests sometimes conflict with their own; (6) an ongoing planning process is desirable and necessary; (7) there must be a large and widely shared information base; (8) planners should avoid limiting recommendations based on perceptions of the resources likely to become-available; and (9) barriers within the existing structure should be razed and leveled. Since 1989, Virginia's Blue Ridge Community College has experimented with a decentralized approach, and the first decentralized strategic plan was published in 1991. Although application of the plan has been uneven, the college community has supported the plan and has been optimistic. (Contains 14 references.)

Their contributions might only be seen as legitimate when put through a formal PAR process. We have thus developed a “woven collective analysis” approach, intertwining experiential, practical and academic knowledge. Diverse stakeholders reflect together and combine their voices, while ensuring that the experiential knowledge of people living in poverty remains the primary focus. Using the weaving process as a metaphor and a food-autonomy project as an example, we explore the steps involved in this data analysis approach: warping (or the need to recognize different types of knowledge and identify the actions required to use and communicate them); threading (or how to put into place a series of frameworks to allow information on social patterns to emerge, while combining varied knowledge); and sleying (or using targeted collective analysis to tighten up the information, in a recurring and systematic way). These combined operations contribute to the weaving process and the emergence of a new fabric of complex, social and transformational Common knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Play is generally considered an immature affair. However, adult play is present in several mammal species living in complex social systems. Here, I hypothesize that adult social play is favored by natural selection in those species characterized by high level of social tolerance and/or by the need of others' cooperation to reach a goal (i.e., leverage). The integration and comparison of bio-behavioral data on non-human primates and wild social carnivores allows drawing a comprehensive picture on the importance of adult play in facing unpredictable, novel social situations and in overcoming stressful experiences. The ability to cope with potentially competitive interactions through play can favor the emergence of egalitarian societies. A further interesting and beneficial aspect of adult play is its role in synchronizing group activities and favoring collective decision making by renovating the motivation to cooperate in groupmates. As a last step, some considerations about the presence of adult play in the most egalitarian and cooperative human groups (e.g., hunter-gatherer societies) allows discussing the apparent dichotomy between cultural and biological evolution of certain behavioral traits, including social play in adulthood.",

Still, after several diplomatic setbacks and in response to new trends in international relations, France had to adapt and build new tools to promote its image and the image of its diplomacy in the world. At least six avenues have been explored: (a) the use of cultural action and audio-visual programs to promote France, its political sensibility, and its way of life, has long been considered as the essence of public diplomacy; (b) the promotion of French language—or Francophonie—as a vector of influence remains cherished; (c) digital diplomacy has been developed more recently, with undeniable progress but also with many limits; (d) partnerships with French non-state actors of international renown have been launched, although by no means comparable to practices prevalent in other Western democratic powers? (e) the use of local actors and their own international initiatives (\"decentralized cooperation\") in support of the national foreign policy has increased, without reaching the levels of federal states such as Canada, the United States or Germany; (f) international cooperation in education and research, plus the action of think tanks, is a key element in France's public diplomacy, but competition is becoming fiercer and French think tanks need to be developed; (g) a more natural French trend consists of relying on the head of state to promote the image of France.

The social impacts of large projects on Indigenous Peoples: Procedures, processes and protests [Groningen]: University of Groningen Bedrijven die de sociale impact van hun activiteiten onvoldoende aandacht geven, zullen minder makkelijk een Social Licence to Operate verkrijgen of behouden. Dit betekent dat bedrijven minder steun van de plaatselijke gemeenschap zullen hebben om een bepaald project te implementeren of uit te voeren, wat een flinke financiele tegenslag kan betekenen. Grote projecten met grote sociale en milieu effecten voor lokale gemeenschappen komen wereldwijd veelvuldig voor en kunnen tijdens de implementatie en uitvoering zelfs tot schendingen van mensenrechten leiden. Als aan de sociale impact te weinig aandacht wordt besteed, kan dat leiden tot ongewenste effecten op de lokale bevolking: zoals zorgen over, en angst voor, projecten en hun impact op de verbintenis met de leefomgeving (sense of place), sociaal kapitaal en welzijn. Wanneer Inheemse volken beinvloed worden, worden deze gevolgen vergroot vanwege de specifieke cultuur en de sterke band met de leefomgeving en het milieu. Negatieve effecten kunnen betrekking hebben op de sociale organisatie, de taal, het levensonderhoud, de plaatselijke voedselvoorziening en gezondheid. Deze studie biedt een overzichtelijk perspectief op de implementatie van grootschalige projecten die waarschijnlijk grote maatschappelijke impact hebben en milieubelasting betekenen voor Inheemse volken. Op een Braziliaanse case study gebaseerd worden aanbevelingen gedaan hoe projecten de rechten van gemeenschappen kunnen respecteren en conflict kan worden verminderd teneinde de relaties tussen de bedrijven en Inheemse volken te verbeteren.",

      "abstract": "Extensive research demonstrates a positive relationship between social participation and health and well-being in older adults. Yet, knowledge is scarce regarding the diverse practices older individuals employ when engaging with others in everyday life settings. For the purpose, we elaborate on the concept of togetherness to encapsulate the full spectrum of co-located activities. Togetherness embodies a spatiotemporal understanding of sociality, involving \"being with\" others in shared spaces, times, and projects. We empirically investigate how various forms of togetherness manifest in everyday life and explore the motivation behind immediate and more overarching projects and goals. Drawing on time-space diaries that inform in-depth interviews with 22 older adults (aged 68-85) in Gothenburg, Sweden, our findings reveal that practising everyday togetherness seldom is a standalone project with the explicit purpose of socializing. More often, sociality is integrated into projects with other primary, sometimes overlapping, goals such as maintaining everyday routines, providing structure and rhythm to daily life, breaking away from routines, thriving and feeling safe in a place, and seeking inspiration and creativity in life.",

Estas reacciones no se distribuyeron uniformemente y agravaron la marginación y las desigualdades sociales existentes (UNDRR and UNU-EHS 2022: 11). Los trabajadores migrantes e informales, y los que viven en asentamientos informales, se vieron afectados de manera desproporcional por los impactos de la pandemia a la salud, y demás impactos secundarios, que también perjudicaron sus medios de sustento y su habilidad para cubrir sus necesidades básicas y limitaron su habilidad para recuperarse debido a las estrategias de afrontamiento que tuvieron que adoptar (Chen et al. 2022: 19). Al mismo tiempo, una reducción del riesgo de desastres (RRD) exitosa generalmente depende de redes y actores informales (Boersma et al. 2019). Se ha discutido mucho acerca de las limitaciones de los mecanismos formales de gobernanza de desastres, con fallas relacionadas en gran parte con la falta de flexibilidad, las estrategias de coordinación, los incentivos, la comprensión del contexto o el conocimiento (local), además de haber un enfoque en las soluciones tecnocráticas y de infraestructura en lugar de utilizar los recursos locales existentes (Duda, Kelman and Glick 2020: 375). A pesar de esto, todavía predominan los enfoques de gestión de desastres centrados en un solo riesgo a corto plazo (Donoghoe et al. 2022). Una investigación respaldada por Covid-19 Responses for Equity Programme (CORE), que cuenta con el apoyo del Centro Internacional de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo (IDRC), señala la necesidad de disposiciones especiales que aborden los desafíos actuales y futuros de los trabajadores informales en la respuesta a desastres (Pillai et al. 2022b). Esto requiere no solo incluir a los trabajadores informales en las políticas de recuperación del Covid-19, sino también colocarlos en un lugar central de las políticas económicas, sociales y de desastres (Alfers et al. 2022). Se debe priorizar ciertas acciones, incluyendo la necesidad de mejores datos, la revisión de políticas para garantizar que abarquen consideraciones de género y medidas de protección social que incluyan a trabajadores migrantes e informales, y un mayor reconocimiento a la función significativa que tienen las organizaciones de base en el apoyo a grupos marginados en tiempos de crisis.",

      "title": "Social Construction of Technology in Organizational Communication",
      "abstract": "The development of technology and innovation is assumed to change the human communication behavior and even alter the communication process likes computermediated communication that affects interpersonal relationships in the personal and professional life of an individual (West and Turner, 2010: 524), including in organizational life. Within organizational context, the expectation of the use new communication technology in order to improve productivity and efficiency by applying ideas to build interactivity and responsive networks between organizations and their publics (Cheney, 2004: 350) both internal and external public. The environment of the modern organization has always been technological, but this has been understood in a number of distinct ways. For example, seen as collections of rationalized and instrumental practices, organizations themselves have been regarded as technologies in which effective information and communication processes are critical (Taylor, 1911, Thompson 1967 in Jackson, et al., 2001: 1). When it viewed from the Interactionist perspectives, the communication process occurs in a social context in which the interpretation, attitude and use of communication technology in an organization are built together in the social context. This condition alienates the organization from the assumptions of technological determinism which assumes that the new communications technology 'determines' what changes occur within the organization (Pace and Faules, 2005: 232). The view of technological determinism does not take into account that the behavior of organizational members, as human beings, requires the relationship and interpretation (Pace and Faules, 2005: 232) of technology which is constructed from social interactions between groups of organizations that brings closer into the perspective of the social construction of technology. To those who work in organizations and use the new communication technology, sometime there may be the unplanned changes within the organization. The fundamental point is the communication process and communication technology is not perceived as an objective, value-free entities, but socially constructed (Rice 1992 in Pace and Faules, 2005: 233). It suggests that members of the organization have discretion in interpreting the technology used by organizations where such interpretation is usually the result of social construction. The discretion in interpreting this technology explicitly leads to a concept of flexibility interpretive that refers to the social construction of technology approach (Pinch and Bijker 1984: 419)",

New uses of values in organizing and managing inequalities emerge. Values lead active social life as bourgeois virtues (McCloskey, 2006), their subversive alternatives or translated “memes” of cultural history. Since social life of values went global and online, tracing their hybrid manifestations requires cross-culturally competent domestication (Magala, 2005) as if they were “memes” manipulated for further reengineering. Hopes are linked to emergent concepts of “microstorias” (Boje,2002), bottom-up, participative, open citizenship (Balibar,2004), disruption of stereotypical branding in mass-media (Sennett, 2006). However, Kuhn’s opportunistic deviation from Popperian evolutionary epistemology should fade away with other hidden injuries of Cold War, to free our agenda for the future of social sciences in general and organizational sciences in particular (Fuller, 2000, 2003).",

      "abstract": "It has been argued previously that, due to industrial development and the related ideology of modernity, old people in contemporary society are less able to negotiate favorable or, even, equitable exchange rates. This structural analysis, however, leaves unanswered important issues concerning the \"working out\" of the terms of the exchange agreement. The focus of this paper is the negotiation and maintenance of exchange relationships. How, for example, does the individual old person and his or her exchange partner(s) decide such issues as the relative \"social worth\" of the partners, the resources each possesses and is willing to exchange, the value of the resources to be exchanged, or the rate at which resources are to be exchanged. While such terms may occasionally be submitted in written form for the approval of each partner, in most cases such issues are resolved in a much more informal manner. Approval or consent to an exchange agreement is generally reached through a process of informal negotiation which is commonly referred to as conversation. Because of the lack of any obvious or generally accepted conversion table (by which resources are converted in standardized units of power), the mere possession of a power resource is insufficient, in most cases, to obtain an automatic share of privilege. Rather, the resource must be entered into the exchange negotiation in orderfor the individual's claim to be accepted as legitimate. Talk is the means by which potential power is converted into power-in-use.",

Yet, empirical research on the matter in Italy is still poor. Even theoretical analyses often follow a prescriptive approach, as if community networking and social capital generation were natural properties of such organizations. The article elaborates on a few theoretical categories which can be helpful in operationalizing and empirically testing the third sector's ties with local communities - whether in the start-up or during the life course of social enterprises. A case study on an EU-led funding initiative involving social enterprises is then analyzed. Special attention is given to the role of \"intermediary bodies\", representative of the civil society at local level. This allows for a critical reflection on the potential and the limits of partnerships between public authorities and social enterprises. As far as these enterprises state, and as they aree expected to participate in local policy-making processes, some key dilemmas emerge, such as the tension between advocacy and policybuilding, or between the representation of local civil society and their active involvement in public policies. Finally, a balance is provided of the prospects for a more \"community oriented\" model of social enterprise to be developed across the country.

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the importance of social science to conservation practice and policy is well accepted, social scientists remain in the minority in conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We explored how social science has started to inform the work of WWT, an NGO dedicated to the restoration of wetlands for people and nature. Through reflections on our experiences working in WWT's social dimensions unit and interviews with colleagues from different backgrounds and roles, we critically reflected on the integration of social science in wetland conservation science, advocacy, and practice. Social science was a relatively new and marginal research domain for WWT. There was confusion within the organization around what social science entails and its value for conservation practice. We and our colleagues have faced challenges communicating across disciplines and establishing a rigorous ethical review process for social science research. It is difficult to navigate under a scarcity mindset in conservation (i.e., that there is not enough time, resources, or funding) and at the same time to build collaborations and long‐term relationships and contribute to wider environmental and social movements. Social science integration brought multiple opportunities to WWT, including creating and showing impact, building support, and broadening funding opportunities. Social science was seen to inform campaigns and wetland restoration policy. Further integration of social science is needed at WWT. To achieve this, we recommend building confidence in the role of social science across teams through further training to improve organizational competency in social science theory and methods. We emphasize the need for thoughtful, long‐term approaches alongside shorter term approaches to wetland restoration. We recommend that conservation NGOs promote practices of self‐reflection to recognize the inherently political nature of conservation. We expect that our experiences and recommendations are relevant for other organizations. We invite other perspectives and hope our reflections lead to further conversations in the conservation sector.",

We need both processes to understand how feelings in general and hurt feelings in particular originate. Development usually is evaluated according to ages and stages of the life cycle, whereas socialization is such a constant and continuous process that is difficult to conceptualize it according to levels of emotional, cognitive, and social functioning, including personality characteristics. Nonetheless, both processes are necessary because different individuals react differently to environmental influences and to hurt feelings. For instance, what could be hurtful at one age might not be longer hurtful either at a younger or older age or vice versa.",

      "title": "Spontaneity Versus Formalization in East Europe: Some Problems of Bureaucratization under State Socialism",
      "abstract": "The dilemma of spontaneity versus formalization is more or less valid for all societies. Freedom as the availability of alternative courses of action has been a precious cultural and moral value in history. The functional requisites of societies, related to communication, production, distribution, defense, replacement of members, and social control (Lenski, Lenski, 1974:28) have provided a more or less convincing justification for the limitation of freedom. Specialization, hierarchy, rules, procedures, impersonality and cult of competence, all these bureaucratic characteristics have been treated for centuries as remedia for laziness, irresponsibility, and parochialism. The progress of formalization has historically contributed to the strengthening of authority, as a legitimized power which brings about compliance of people to behave according to the will of those who occupy crucial positions. However, rigidification of such structures has several negative side effects: dissolution of several important and useful human bonds, ineffectiveness against external change, internal struggle between various groups to preserve and enlarge their areas of discretion (Crozier 1963), keeping too much to the rules, over-adherence to organizational means (and not ends), spoiling of superiors by the power enjoyed by them, superiors spending too much of their time and effort in controlling subordinates, etc. Strict separation of office and incumbent, in the sense that the official does not possess his office, has been historically beneficial for the material well being of societies, but it also has limited the personal involvement of office occupants. In the bureaucracies people who occupy crucial positions tend to develop vested interests within the scope of their jurisdiction. The constituent parts of bureaucracies resist actions which do not serve their own purposes (the problem of recalcitrance), and people in control of these parts become the prime beneficiaries (Blau, Scott 1962) of them. The ‘rules of the game’ that apply to the bureaucratic organizations as human artefacts quite often prevent them from achieving a dynamic equilibrium, namely to react to forces of change in an adaptive manner. Those organizations easily transform themselves from goal-seeking entities into the security-seeking mechanisms. Following Etzioni (1965) it is possible to say that they follow a ‘survival model’ instead of an ‘efficiency model'.",

Our panel symposium brings together diverse panelists who are leaders in community research to spark generative, interactive conversation about new frontiers of community experiences at work. Together we’ll explore (1) how community experiences emerge in crisis situations, (2) unpack the practices employees and leaders can engage in to seed and nurture community experiences in organizations and (3) explore how cultivating community experiences can be achieved in hybrid, remote work settings and non-traditional work contexts. Considering ways by which community experience can transcend far beyond the organizational boundaries, we’ll examine how organizations can best partner with external actors to unlock community organizing that can tackle grand challenges of our society and explore how corporate-community co-development can create synergistic settings to cultivate prosperity and social sustainability.",

In the article by Jurgen Howaldt, some key areas of research are identified highlighting the relevance of social innovations on dealing with global dilemmas. Mentioned in this context are “innovation capability research”, “social preconditions for successful innovation processes”, “overcoming the digital divide”, the control “of underlying transformative processes in central social areas”, the “interfaces of different social (partial) rationalities”, the management of “dilemmas” (human resources vs. cost pressure, cooperation vs. competition, sustainability vs. profit maximization), the “establishment of strategic alliances of stakeholders from the worlds of politics and administration, business, science, and civil society”, and finally the “re-configuration of social arrangements” (for example, for the development of pro-active strategies for adapting to the consequences of climate change, 20 et seq.). All of these descriptions can be agreed with. However, is there a chance of such research areas not only being identified from diagnostic investigations of society and innovation, but also of being able to work through these in terms of research with practical relevance leading to the implementation of concrete social innovations? In answer to this question, the following text presents some observations on the current discussion on social innovation and the part it plays in Austrian policy and research on innovation.",

Coordination norms – and informational norms in particular – require that the parties to the norm have common knowledge that they will conform to it. When common knowledge collapses (as it may under the onslaught of surveillance), coordination under the norm becomes impossible.

The aim of the present article is threefold: to put forward a model which treats these responses as a linked set of objects of analysis (rather than marginalizing the former two as in the literature on social movements), to emphasize the importance of social structure and the institutional context for all three responses (contrary to Hirschman's ‘exit, voice and loyalty’ model) and to throw light on responses to housing dissatisfaction in two former state socialist capital cities, Budapest and Moscow. It is shown that: (a) inaction in the housing sphere is concentrated among those in the weakest social structural position and that attempts to represent this as due to their ‘loyalty’ are quite mistaken; (b) that individual action is the dominant response to housing dissatisfaction (an effect of issue domain) and is most common among those in middling or strong social positions; and (c) that although respondents did not consider collective action as a way of dealing with their housing dissatisfaction, such action does exist especially in Moscow where it was due to strong motivation in the face of an unfavourable political and resource context.",

      "abstract": "It is well-known that the need for both social and financial missions creates tension within social enterprises. Less well-known are the specifics around how and why social entrepreneurs themselves construct and experience their situation. Given people vary in their psychological representations of their goals from concrete (i.e., tasks) to more abstract (i.e., values), we anticipated that goal conflict with engaging in financial activities could vary along these lines, leading to potentially different solutions for support. Through collecting interviews and focus group data using goal hierarchies from 37 social entrepreneurs, we find six constructed realities with different salient goals at different levels of cognitive abstraction which either dictate, conflict with, or are dissociated from financial activities. These can explain why social entrepreneurs perceive their financial activities differently – financial activities as out of sight out of mind, aversive, a ball to juggle, a necessary evil, part and parcel, and as king - which are associated with four experiences of goal conflict (i.e., goal conflict as continual questioning, inevitable, manageable, and irrelevant).",

Yet little is known about how common knowledge leaves a trace on the dynamics of a social network. Here we show how an individual's network properties---primarily local clustering and betweenness centrality---provide strong signals of the ability to successfully participate in common knowledge tasks. These signals are distinct from those expected when practices are contagious, or when people use less-sophisticated heuristics that do not yield true coordination. This makes it possible to infer decision rules from observation. We also find that tasks that require common knowledge can yield significant inequalities in success, in contrast to the relative equality that results when practices spread by contagion alone.",

      "title": "Travel during childhood: Children’s perceptions of how contact with host communities influences the socio-emotional dimension of their global citizenship",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing research exploring the effects of travel on visitors’ sense of global citizenship has neglected to consider the perspectives of children. This represents a significant gap in knowledge, particularly considering the significance of family tourism (Séraphin &amp; Gowreesunkar, 2020) and the importance of childhood as a critical developmental stage for fostering key aspects of global citizenship (Skinner &amp; Meltzoff, 2019). This PhD study begins to address this gap through exploring the core research question: How can contact with host communities during travel influence the socio-emotional dimension of children's sense of global citizenship? The socio-emotional dimension of global citizenship is defined as a “sense of belonging to a common humanity, sharing values and responsibilities, empathy, solidarity and respect for differences and diversity” (UNESCO, 2016, p. 2).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social constructionism provided the guiding philosophy throughout this study. As such, I recognised that all knowledge claims are socially constructed (Gergen &amp; Gergen, 2012) and I acknowledged the complexity of researching human experiences (Burr, 2015). In addition, I used a child-centred research approach, which recognised children’s rights, agency, and expertise. This approach was supported by a team of youth advisers and a group of experts in child-centred research who informed three key stages of this study: data collection, data analysis, and data dissemination. To align with my social constructionist, child-centred approach, qualitative methods were used involving in-depth, semi-structured interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following two pilot studies, 60 interviews were conducted involving two interviews each with a total of 30 children. My sample consisted of children aged 11-12 in New Zealand who had travelled internationally in the past five years. Interviews were carried out using Zoom due to Covid-19 restrictions, and involved diverse, interactive activities to build rapport and maintain participant engagement. Interviews were transcribed and analysed alongside fieldwork notes and interview activity data. A six-staged thematic analysis approach (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2021; Nowell et al., 2017) was used for data analysis, and Nvivo 12 was used as the primary tool to assist with data management. Intergroup contact theory (IGCT), a highly studied theory within social psychology, was used as the primary theoretical framework during later stages of analysis. Ethical considerations were centrally placed throughout the research process with the aim of heeding the call for tourism research to be at the forefront of advancing ethical research with children (Canosa &amp; Graham, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study are presented through addressing three research sub-questions. First, in exploring the question 'What forms of host community contact do children experience when they travel?', I conclude that children’s contact with host communities is diverse, nuanced, and dynamic. I propose a new approach for conceptualising contact with host communities which recognises six Ps involved in contact experiences: Person, Purpose, Place, Participation, Perception, and Period. Second, in exploring the question 'How do these experiences shape children's perceptions of host communities?', I conclude that children’s contact experiences play a formative role in the development of their perceptions of host communities as: kind and helpful, knowledgeable and hard-working, poor, and/or different yet similar. Third, in exploring the question 'How do children view the influence of these experiences in shaping the socio-emotional dimension of their sense of global citizenship?', I conclude that host community contact does not inherently foster global citizenship, but rather can be viewed as a tool to reinforce, shift, and/or transform the socio-emotional dimension of children’s sense of global citizenship. The core theoretical contributions of this study are threefold. First, this study contributes to the visitor-host contact literature through developing a new, more holistic conceptualisation of visitor-host contact that recognises the overlapping themes of Person, Purpose, Place, Participation, Perception, and Period. Second, this study contributes to IGCT by demonstrating the value of a social constructionist application of IGCT in an international tourism setting, especially in terms of acknowledging the significance of context. In doing so, it demonstrates how the forms, moderators, mediators, and effects of intergroup contact may be experienced differently when contact occurs in the outgroup’s own environment. Third, this study contributes to global citizenship research through the development of an integrative framework to expand our understanding of the complex relationship between children’s contact with host communities, their perceptions of host communities, and the socio-emotional dimension of their sense of global citizenship. In addition, this study makes an important methodological contribution. I demonstrate that children experience distinct forms, perceptions, and effects of contact, which are reflective of their stage of development and the positions they occupy within society. As such, this study contributes to the call to “develop a rich understanding of the lived tourism experiences of children” (Canosa et al. 2019, p. 97) and contributes new insights to child-centred tourism research ethics and methods. This study also has implications for families, the tourism industry, educators, and future researchers. In particular, the integrative framework developed from this study can serve as a tool to identify which forms of host community contact during childhood may be more/less conducive to fostering global citizenship. Further, the framework can serve as a foundation for future studies seeking to explore the perspectives of children of different ages and nationalities as well as children living within host communities.&lt;/p&gt;",

At an individual level, important interactions amongst constraints could include the relationships that evolve between one's family, playmates/coaches, and specific training activities. Or more broadly, other environmental constraints can be the strong socio-cultural-historical contexts that influence expertise development in sports around the world, such as rugby (e.g. New Zealand) and football (e.g. Brazil). An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the influence of environmental constraints on the development of sport expertise.

      "title": "A town between dialects",
      "abstract": "Speakers’ psycho-social orientation and social knowledge have often been identified as having an important role in linguistic change. We know, for example, that speakers’ adoption of linguistic features from a neighbouring region often correlates with their positive social orientation towards that region (Llamas 2007), and that their social orientation can be discussed with reference to their interpretation of physical, political and social ‘boundaries’ (Llamas 2010). Southport, located 17 miles north of the large industrial city of Liverpool, is historically an independent borough but was absorbed into Merseyside in 1974. Southport and Liverpool are well connected by frequent transport links and, given the high levels of contact between people, it has been predicted that phonetic features of the Liverpool accent will diffuse into the traditional Lancashire accent of Southport (Grey & Richardson 2007). However, a complicating factor is Liverpool’s negative stereotype (Montgomery 2007), which may be predicted to act as a barrier to the diffusion of Liverpool features. This paper aims to analyse the diffusion of two local Liverpool features – the lenition of intervocalic and word-final /t/ and /k/ – in speech from a corpus of 39 speakers stratified by age, gender and socio-economic status. I show that despite the links between the two locations, the features of Liverpool are not diffusing into Southport speech as rapidly as originally hypothesised. The second aim is to investigate whether there is a correlation between speakers’ language use and their spatial mobility patterns by mapping their external (contact) and extra-linguistic (attitudinal) behaviour onto their linguistic production. I show that varying patterns of contact could provide an explanation for the reduced level of diffusion of Liverpool features. In conclusion, I argue that understanding speakers’ psycho-social orientations and social awareness, in conjunction with correlative patterns of speech production is crucial for explaining language change.",

      "title": "Cooperation dynamics in dynamical networks with history-based decisions",
      "abstract": "In many aspects of life on earth, individuals may engage in cooperation with others to contribute towards a goal they may share, which can also ensure self-preservation. In evolutionary game theory, the act of cooperation can be considered as an altruistic act of an individual producing some form of benefit or commodity that can be utilised by others they are associated with, which comes at some personal cost. Under certain conditions, individuals make use of information that they are able to perceive within a group in order to aid with their choices for who they should associate themselves within these cooperative scenarios. However, cooperative individuals can be taken advantage of by opportunistic defectors, which can cause significant disruption to the population. We study a model where the decision to establish interactions with potential partners is based on the opportune integration of the individual’s private ability to perceive the intentions of others (private information) and the observation of the population, information that is available to every individual (public information). When public information is restricted to a potential partners current connection count, the population becomes highly cooperative but rather unstable with frequent invasions of cheaters and recoveries of cooperation. However, when public information considers the previous decisions of the individuals (accepted / rejected connections) the population is slightly less cooperative but more stable. Generally, we find that allowing the observation of previous decisions, as part of the available public information, can often lead to more stable but fragmented and less prosperous networks. Our results highlight that the ability to observe previous individual decisions, balanced by individuals personal information, represents an important aspect of the interplay between individual decision-making and the resilience of cooperation in structured populations.",

      "title": "K problematice hry",
      "abstract": "Generally, game is considered in an undifferentiated way as a good, simply positive thing and it is glorified a a sign of freedom and creativity. Professional literature, too, included moral assessment of the game, both for the life of an individual and the development of civilisation, but it is much more sophisticated (see the work by J. Huizinga and R. Caillois). Caillois uses two criteria: the value of various principles of the game, and the observation of the borders of the game itself or its definition in usual or normal life. Ad 1: In his view our civilisation is characterised by a transition from archaic principles of the mimicry (especially as mask) and ilinx (such as vertigo) to modern agon (competition, credentials) and alea (dice, accident); these principles are social mechanisms and institutions (e.g., agon is competition and alea stock exchange), not only games in the narrow sense (e.g., not only sport or roulette); however, certain games fit in certain social mechanisms, react to a given \"normal life\" and there is interdependence with them. Ad 2: this interdependence is in order - it is neiter a corruption or perversion of the game. Caillois is afraid that this might affect an individual if the game starts to overlap in life, replace it and decline in it - proper competition turns into uncontrolled violence and deviousness and betting on something into superstition in everything. As a result, the moral approach to a game is very rigid. The writer has tried to explain through games the main issue of the life of a 5th-6th school class: whether sex can materialise and related horror. He called sexual games, rituals and habits with game aspect waves (as at stadiums): (a) transgressive: thanks to the aspect \"as if\" or \"just like\" they allow to proceed farther in direct sexual behaviour (mass waves of teasing, reminiscent of an orgy or a dream about an orgy), in love choices and gestures of a couple (\"social games\", mostly in a selected amorous group with the function of declaring or publishing love; the division of the group into couples; anticipation or divination of a love object) or in the articulation of sex fantasies (pornographic production); (b) the French le charivari, English rough music: the community mocks love itself as a transgression or potential crime - after the suffering mockers dismiss the couple; (c) a wave of purification: accumulated sins, including sexual and erotic ones, are symbolically summarised into a gesture of \"tagging\" someone in a chase (while the name of an infectious disease or a pupil is said). This means an evident smearing or purification. The example of a class shows that it is necessary to conceive the borders of a game (or life, environment) as it is to be used by the community; however, it is difficult to morally denounce it if the game is transgressed, corrupted or perverted. The members of the community use the help of artificia dirt - it is a sign of superstition or perversion of alea? When teasing girls, boys use masks (the category of mimicry) of hunters of female bodies (agon) and avoid frontal encounter with a rival in love. However, the games serve not only to restrict the dimension of normal life, but also prepare the openess of its sector in adult life. The interdependence game-life and games among themselves has various forms as revealed by the function of the system of games. As already written by Caillois, many of the archaic forms are still surviving in some form at present.",

      "abstract": "In the previous chapters a very broad understanding of social work has been presented, ranging from the micro- to the macro-level of theory and practice1. So far, however, we have not addressed the debate that has existed within social work concerning the identity of the profession and whether it should most appropriately be focused on intra- and inter-personal issues or on questions of social systems and structures. To what extent can it be argued that post-trauma counselling and therapy with refugees settled in a country of the global North, poverty alleviation among slum dwellers in cities of the global South and environmental management programmes in Asia and Africa all appropriate sites for socials work practice? In order to understand the way in which a consideration of international social work can assist the analysis of social work as a whole, the discussion now turns to a question with which social work has struggled since its early development in the nineteenth century. That is, should social work focus on social issues and human needs at the micro- or the macro-level as defining its core nature?",

Critically, the field also suffers from over-reliance on perspectives and social systems of dominant culture—both in how disability is regarded and in relation to other dimensions of identity and culture. These lenses lead to research findings that reinforce, rather than reduce, social inequities. We propose a framework that minimizes reliance on diagnostic categories, shifts from deficit- to person-centered models, acknowledges people’s multiple identities, and includes self-advocates and diverse communities as partners in the research enterprise. The systems change necessary to support this framework is described.",

The most notable and obvious cases of dissent occur when employees engage in whistleblowing by dissenting to industry regulatory bodies, the media, or both.

Rather, employees often express their dissent within organizations either directly to their supervisors, often referred to as upward dissent, or to their co‐workers, known as lateral dissent. Additionally, employees may choose to speak with family and nonwork friends about their concerns, by engaging in displaced dissent (Kassing 1997, 1998).",

      "title": "Community Social Psychology in Latin America: Myths, dilemmas and challenges",
      "abstract": "Latin American Community Social Psychology (CSP) is one of the few psychological disciplines that has had an autonomous development in our region. This development has been characterized by a theoretical, methodological and applied production derived from the diverse and complex problems in our context. The development includes academic and non-academic practices and products, as evidenced by numerous undergraduate and graduate university courses and programs in the field, as well as its multiple areas of application (health, environment, education, slums, disasters, public policies), processes (organization, participation, critical reflection, consciousness raising, leadership, empowerment, feeling of belonging, identity), scopes of action (governmental and nongovernmental organizations, health centers, educational institutions, community organizations, residential communities), populations (particularly socially vulnerable and economically disadvantaged groups), activities (research, intervention, evaluation, training, negotiation, prevention, conferences, publications). The increasing number and variety of activities undertaken by CSP professionals provide support for a sustained growth of the discipline. However, has CSP’s trajectory been in accordance with the needs, principles, values and goals that guided the field’s birth half a century ago? Have CSP’s accomplishments satisfied its founders’ expectations? What is the current pertinence of such accomplishments and of the elements which oriented their fulfillment, in view of rapid and continuous changes in virtually all society’s domains? Have CSP’s theoretical developments contributed to solve psychosocial problems it initially aimed to address? Have methodological strategies employed, developed or adapted by CSP been useful for understanding, managing and producing knowledge about the issues addressed? In addition, considering CSP trajectory, can we refer at the end of the first decade of the millenium, to the same but grown up and established discipline, or are different CSP’s emerging?, Which are some dilemmas and challenges currently confronted by researchers, academicians, practitioners, advocates, whose timings, tasks and demands vary? Are universities providing adequate training in terms of skills and tools for working with communities? Which are some of the myths on CSP that have emerged? Finally, has CSP contributed, both from inside and outside academy to ameliorate poverty in our continent? These, as well as many other questions and answers coming from participants in the Third Conference will undoubtedly help to collectively strenghten old but still relevant directions for the discipline and to outline new ones, that will make us and the people we work with better human beings.",

      "title": "The event as the manifestation of subjective creativity",
      "abstract": "The development of various aspects of social life gives rise to problems associated with the possibilities of modelling, creating events – in other words, the problems of a “special” or “organized” event. Having received a fairly wide distribution in the field of management, marketing, political science, etc., the concept of а “special” event is increasingly becoming the subject of research in philosophy. The second concept – an “organized” event – is introduced by researchers quite rarely and most often acts either as a synonym for the first one, or as the designation of a stage of production of a special event, although, in our opinion, it has a different meaning. The philosophers’ new interest in this concept can be explained by the fact that the event is one of the most important dimensions of people’s lives, it has a significant impact on social life, it helps to do public relations, achieve certain goals in the field of culture, politics, management, etc. In addition, the specificity of the special event is the opportunity to gain experience of living through the values that it translates to society. Since the “event” concept is generic in relation to the concept we are researching, we will consider its main characteristics through the relationship with other concepts close to it, that is, we will try to identify the topos of the event. Events or “natural” events (meaning events not directly organized by a person) have an ontological essence, and are unique. They lack a temporal dimension, structure, that is, they do not exist, but happen. They are characterized by surprise, suddenness and lead to a change in the state of affairs, to a new result, to profound changes. The event as such is not the fulfillment of the intended goal. The event is always involved in the life of people, even if it is a natural event. The involvement of such an event is determined by its significance for people, for society. Special events are events in which the main feature is their generatability, producibility and control by the subject-creator. They have a script and a storyline. They can also act as a kind of a replication of events that have already occurred and that are important for society. Such events are distinguished by the special role of the subject in the event. Researchers in the field of economics often equate the concepts of a special event and an event of interest, but researchers in the field of philosophy highlight their differences. The event of interest is characterized as a formal, emotionally and meaningfully empty action devoid of uniqueness. Its main function is to attract attention, which is secondary for the special event. The event of interest only creates the illusion of movement and change, and the special event stands out in a series of one-order phenomena, differs from them, violates regularity, changes observation laws. In addition, the special event has certain restrictions in time and space, since it is intended to be either a memory or to indicate a place, and this shows the value of the special event. The event of interest does not have such limitations – it can be organized wherever and whenever you want. As for the organized event, here, along with generatability and producibility, it is necessary to highlight the use of an emerging event or an event that occurred. Such events (as well as special ones) also have a purpose, an approximate plot, a plan. But the purpose of the organized event is not obvious; it is hidden, at least from the perceiving subject. The role of the subject (subject-creator) of the organized event is constricted: the possibilities of control (as in the case of the special event) are limited.",

      "abstract": "In the traditional definition, diplomacy is the art and practice of conducting negotiations between representatives of states. Long lasting time, diplomacy has for key function to promote interests and images.Public diplomacy, define in United States, ‘emphasises dimensions of international relations beyond traditional diplomacy; the cultivation by governments of public opinion in other countries; the interaction of private groups and interests in one country with another; the reporting of foreign affairs and its impacts on policy; communication between those whose job is communication, as diplomats and foreign correspondents; and the process of intercultural communications.’ (Cull quoted in Szondi, 2008, p. 2).Traditionally, public diplomacy had for target governments, elites, media, and academics. (Szondi, 2008) emphasises the lack of clear and stable definition able to identify the limits and the content of public diplomacy. But, for 10 years, communication processes, strategies and tools became the key point of public diplomacy.(Szondi, 2008, p. 11) indicate that, among other things, communication now includes social networks, targets are more and more fragmented, and research on reception is becoming important. Public diplomacy is oriented towards ‘to come closer together’.The wish of citizens for more transparency, the pressure of media and the wish of ministries of foreign affairs to develop their audiences is present context: ‘Digital diplomacy refers to the migration of diplomatic institutions and diplomats to the online world through the adoption of web 2.0 applications and ICTs .To develop our topic, I plan to introduce “The logic of connective action” approach (Bennett, Segerberg, 2012) which claims that digital media allows connexion and actions though sharing content. Our research question is: which connexion and what dialogues are possible between an embassy, a diplomat and its publics. Furthermore, will diplomats follow the same strategies as corporations do: engage, anime, dialogue? Our methodology is literature reviews, interviews with press officers (Swiss, Swedish and French embassies in Delhi, Paris, Brussels and Stockholm) and surveys of three case studies of Public diplomacy through interviews and Facebook and Twitter activities: Switzerland with “Swissando”, Sweden with “Midwife4all”, France with “Gout de France.”Are the logic of connective action and the wish of conversation realist? Can we evaluate it? Can digital tools and strategies succeed in building a certain type of relation between and embassy and a public at large, even if influence and persuasion remain the essence of diplomacy?",

      "abstract": "It is a truism that all action within the international system can be reduced to the action of individuals. It is also true, however, that international relations cannot be adequately understood in terms of individual attitudes and behaviors. Models of the international system usually deal with larger units, nation-states, as prime actors. To what extent can such models give us adequate explanations of international relations without some built-in variables to deal with individual decision-making? It may be that some processes in international relations can be adequately explained on the level of social structure without explicit consideration of the personality, predispositions, attitudes, and behavior of the individual decision-maker. In that case, the introduction of variables dealing with individual behavior would complicate the model without commensurate payoff in terms of increased understanding and prediction. This would be true if the impact of individual decision-making on the behavior of nations in their relations with other nations were slight, or if the impact varied randomly (because, for instance, of idiosyncratic factors) among the population of international events that one was trying to explain. If, on the other hand, models of the international system that either ignore or make grossly simplifying assumptions about individual decision-making can explain international relations only very imperfectly, it may well be worth the additional effort to build variables about individual decision-making into them.",

It has been clarified that EI and SI play an important role in decision making. Violations frequently occur all over the world, although we definitely understand that we should not commit violations, and a secret to prevent this might exist in the enhancement of both social intelligence and reliability. The construction of social structure or system that supports organizational efforts to enhance both social intelligence and reliability would be essential. Traditional safety education emphasizes that it is possible to change attitudes or mind toward safety by means of education. In spite of this，accidents or scandals frequently occur and never decrease. These problems must be approached on the basis of the full understanding of social intelligence and limited reasonability in decision making. Social dilemma (We do not necessarily cooperate in spite of understanding its importance, and we sometimes make decision not to select cooperative behavior. Non-cooperation gives rise to a desirable result for an individual. However, if all take non-cooperative actions, undesirable results are finally induced to all.) must be solved in some ways and the transition from relief (closed) society to global (reliability) society must be realized as a whole. New social system, where cooperative relation can be easily and reliably obtained, must be constructed to support such an approach and prevent violation-based accidents.",

Although cultural, historical, and political forces shape particular instantiations of intergroup relations and bias, in this chapter we focus primarily on general processes representing the psychological foundations of bias. Language, for example, is one basic identifier of group membership. It reveals whether people belong to the same or different groups and immediately assigns a person to a particular group, arousing relevant attitudes and stereotypes. In general, people are suspicious of (Lev-Ari & Keysar, 2010) and respond negatively to others who speak a different language (for a review, see Gluszek & Dovidio, 2010a), even when what is said is translated into their own language (Stephan & Stephan, 1986).

      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Objectives In conversations about expanding age-friendly ecosystems, the concept of “age-friendliness” has not been explored in relation to residential settings. Research Design and Methods This multiple-case study compared four residents’ perspectives on the age-friendliness of a retirement and assisted living community, combining individual semi-structured interviews with observational data and organizational document analyses in a contextualist thematic examination. Results Three themes depict (A) existing experiences of the setting as “age-friendly” and the tension of the built design vs. identity; (B) resident-to-resident microaggressions, delineated into 4 subthemes including identity-related, intergenerational, condition-related microaggressions, and their influence on social isolation; and (C) desired experiences of the setting as “age-friendly” reflecting the social design. In cases of visibly perceptible diversity (white cane, darker skin tone), residents fared worse in experiencing microaggressions stemming from ableism, racism, and age differences. Conversely, in cases of visibly imperceptible diversity, residents had more positive or entirely positive experiences. Although the setting met many environmental and healthcare needs, it lacked design factors prioritizing meaningful social relationships among residents, affecting social isolation. Discussion and Implications Resident-to-resident social relationships were key in the experience of a retirement and assisted living community as age-friendly. Resident-to-resident microaggressions undermined perceptions of the community as age-friendly, and influenced social isolation. We reflect on the organizational role in mitigating against negative social relationships and social isolation to maximize dignity.",

      "title": "Living together apart: the effect of boundary-salience on the stability of contact. Evidence from two Portuguese neighbourhoods",
      "abstract": "This article explores how boundary salience affects the stability of intergroup contact. The research draws on interviews with 57 residents of Cerco and Pasteleira, two residential areas in Porto (Portugal), which are characterized by administrative, socioeconomic, and ethnic differences. The interviews reveal that, despite their proximity to out-groups and their spaces, some residents avoid contact opportunities to achieve separateness, while others enter into voluntary and involuntary contact. Such individual practices reflect subjective interpretations of boundary salience. The study finds that boundary salience affects the stability of intergroup contact by influencing individuals' socio-spatial practices. These practices are the most stable and consensual at the extreme poles of boundary salience (i.e. very salient and very blurred), which result in stable forms of either segregation or integration. However, when the salience of boundaries is moderate, individual practices are more inconsistent and sensitive to subjective interpretations and personal experiences, often resulting in fluctuating forms of social mixing.",

This article suggests, however, that moving to a meta level is not in itself a solution, since it may easily bring along such patterns. Inequalities persist through specific mechanisms that may be present in both ordinary deliberation and meta-deliberation. We explore such mechanisms empirically, by focusing on experiences of people that were excluded from discussions to which they were uniquely qualified to contribute. Our case is the 2013 Stockholm riots, and our interviewees are people who live, work, and engage in local civil society groups in the affected neighborhoods. These interviews helped us identify five mechanisms that affect a society’s capacity for reflective uptake in both ordinary deliberation and meta-deliberation: (1) imposition of preexisting narratives, (2) inclusion of locally dominant actors, (3) discursive distancing, (4), reliance on social markers, and (5) paternalistic conflict avoidance.",

I argue that some performance structures are increasingly central to civil engagement as groups become less likely to interact but more likely to virtually observe one another and that conceptualizing these performances is essential to understanding recent political events in pluralistic societies.",

      "abstract": "Formal volunteering comprises activities within an organizational context, while informal volunteering includes activities performed outside of an organizational context. In this symposium, we ask whether formal and informal volunteering compete with one another (“competition hypothesis”) or if they are instead two sides of the same coin (“same coin hypothesis”). If the “competition hypothesis” holds true, there would be a negative correlation between formal and informal volunteering (individuals involved in formal volunteering would be less likely to provide informal neighborhood support). One of underlying causes for the “competition hypothesis” might be competing resources (e.g. finite time). If the “same coin” hypothesis holds true, there would be a positive correlation between formal and informal volunteering (an individual involved in formal volunteering is more likely to provide informal neighborhood support). One of the underlying causes for the “same coin hypothesis” might be overlapping motives (e.g. altruism). The relationship between formal and informal volunteering might differ across different societal groups and change with age. Restrictions in resources and entry barriers might lead to competition between formal and informal volunteering in some groups (e.g. individuals with lower education). Across age groups there might also be differences in the relationship between formal and informal volunteering. As people grow older and individual resources dwindle, one might assume there is a positive correlation between formal and informal volunteering up to the third age, and a negative correlation in the fourth age. Participants in the symposium will report empirical findings from studies on volunteering.",

Mobility constitutes the most substantive way to rebalance these inequalities, and within rural planning, a wide-ranging debate has arisen around its provision as a service and solution. We review these mobility approaches, their evolution towards more complex conceptualisations of accessibility and influence on social relations. The fundamental role played by automobility in the social sustainability of rural areas is then explored, in the way it may contribute to other inequalities and mobility deprivation, for example. Finally, we conclude by considering the challenges and opportunities involved in three major processes of rural transformation for rural accessibility planning: population ageing, the impact of new communication and information technologies, and the transition towards a new kind of mobility (i.e. shared, autonomous, collaborative and post-carbon).",

In no small way the concern currently being addressed to this issue is indicative of a much broader preoccupation with the impact of social change on individual and community health in general. For while adolescents, because of their particular position in modern and modernizing societies, have possibly presented more socially dramatic manifestations of the effects of a new environment on lifestyle and behaviour, they have not been alone in experiencing these social change influences. Many of the ambiguities, stresses and needs of modern society have produced, in one way or another, health and psycho-social problems among other age groups too.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Almost by definition, “Emancipatory Gerontology” carries implications like “choice” and “freedom” which in gerontology have often presupposed what is often termed “agency”. Agency remains a popular concept in gerontology and related fields such as life-course studies when, e.g., exploring such matters as life transitions and decision-making in areas like family formation or retirement. Yet its often-glib and superficial invocation reflects daunting problems identified in recent scholarship, concerning agency’s conceptualization and measurement. For any construct, adequate measurement presupposes a sound conceptual definition. The very definition of agency remains unresolved and problematic, despite numerous recent efforts at theoretical reformulation and refinement. Some issues revolve around nuances in the history of the term and its dimensions, others around issues of measurement. We contend that an even more fundamental set of problems arise because of a continued lack of recognition of the force of culture-specific symbol systems and social structure to frame the categories and nuances of thought within which agentic intentions are externalized in action. For example, no one chooses their native language, yet even freely chosen and passionately pursued “agentic” acts represent an expression of conscious intent formulated within perceptions, aesthetics, etc., structured by that language and its accompanying culture. We suggest that the structure-agency tension corresponds closely to the distinction between language and speech (langue/parole) articulated by de Saussure, and to related insights offered by Bourdieu. We contend that emancipation ultimately requires rigorous attention to constraint, and hence recognition of the structuring of agency by unrecognized and naturalized features of context.",

      "title": "An Ethno-Linguistic Approach to the Study of Address Terms in Lesotho",
      "abstract": "1. Introduction In every community/society, there are specific norms which can be considered as rules of conduct that guide behaviour of members of that community. Goffman (1964:474) contends that the rules of conduct constitute part of etiquette of group and impose on each member an obligation to conduct him or herself in a particular way towards others. Address can be considered as one of such practice. Address are informed by rules of conduct, and are inevitably part of everyday activity. Terms of address are important linguistic mechanisms through which a speaker's attitude towards another and his or her interpretation of relationship with others is reflected Forms of address have their roots in socio-cultural context of a society. Many linguists have come up with definition of address terms. Among them, Oyetade (1995) defines address as words or expressions used in interactive, dyadic and face-to-face situations to designate person being talked to. Leech (1999) considers that of address are an important formulaic verbal behaviour well recognised in sociolinguistic literature as they signal transactional, interpersonal and deictic ramifications in human relationships. To Afful (2006) terms of address constitute an important part of verbal behaviour through which behaviour, norms and practices of a society can be identified. Other scholars also consider study of address a fruitful field for sociolinguistics due to fact that it shows how interpersonal relationships can be socially and strategically constructed (Fitch 1991). As a universal cultural feature, address in most languages include kinship such as 'father', 'mother', 'brother', 'sister'; titles such as 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Sir', 'Madam', 'your honor', 'his Excellency', 'his Holiness', 'his Majesty'; names that may further subdivide into family names, nicknames, given names, and pronouns to designate first, second, and third person singular or plural. However, despite universal nature of address in human languages, their uses in specific languages vary a great deal and they invariably reflect cultural values that speakers of a given language attach to internal relationships that exist among its communities (Zeitlyn 1993). It is usually not sufficient to understand intrinsic values of address from mere translations from a language such as English. Thus, a better understanding of their specific uses can be captured from an ethno-linguistic point of view, by looking at them from their users' standpoint. Although there is some literature on Sesotho forms of address, their usage and change has not been explored. As Letsoela (2008) argues, an exploration of various forms of address in Sesotho may help in understanding culture of people and also in knowing reason why people behave way they do in an encounter with others in different situations. Note that address examined in this paper are limited to names only. 2. Review of Related Works Studies in socio-linguistics used to be limited to domestic or familial settings. However, with a considerable degree of interest, sociolinguists have been deeply concerned with exploring different dimensions in selection of address throughout past decades. To begin with, Brown and Gilman's (1960) classic study in sociolinguistics on pronominal address system highlights semantic power and solidarity in relation to address terms. Since this classic study in sociolinguistics, a good number of studies with much broader scope and profundity have emerged. Hudson (1980) points out that an important dimension of variation in address has to do with cultural patterns that hold for some particular population in general due to their social values, beliefs and customs. Subsequent studies on address have focused on various languages and support view that address forms/ identify and construct cultural beliefs. …",

      "abstract": "A longitudinal, qualitative study of three types of medical residents (surgeons, primary care, and radiologists) during their first year at a prestigious graduate medical education center reveals the role of sensemaking and social identities in the socialization process. We argue that individuals are motivated to make sense of the tasks that they are assigned to do at work. During this sensemaking process, individuals draw upon an identity menu to help them interpret who they are in the context of these allocated tasks. We use the term identity menu to denote that individuals choose from multiple work-related social identities (e.g., professional and organizational) to facilitate sensemaking. After performing a task-identity comparison, individuals engage in one of two sets of activities. If the tasks they are performing can be explained using an existing social identity, individuals engage in identity enrichment whereby the knowledge of that social identity is deepened. However, if there is a mismatch between tasks and identity, individuals look to other organizational or professional identities to help them make sense of their tasks. Over time, these latter individuals can come to construct new subgroup social identities as their tasks change. Social identities modified via enhancement or construction may come to be added to individuals' identity menus. These modified identities may then, in turn, facilitate future sensemaking. Our research suggests that socialization is a dynamic process, and that identities both shape and are shaped by the socialization process. Implications for theory and research in socialization are discussed.",

La integracion de estos elementos externos en una comunidad establecida con sus tradicionales estrategias y formas de socializacion podia dar lugar a problemas diversos, si bien existian mecanismos para permitir la integracion de estos recien llegados. Uno de ellos fue el padrinazgo, que permitia establecer una serie de lazos con los nativos de manera mas flexible y temprana que mediante otros recursos, como el matrimonio. Sin embargo, podia ocurrir que dicha integracion inicial se llevara a cabo dentro de otros grupos foraneos ya asentados, o en todo caso atendiendo en lo posible al recurso del paisanaje. En definitiva, diferentes estrategias de reproduccion social, exogamicas y/o endogamicas, utilizadas para enhebrarse en el tejido social existente.

Some analogies can be seen between certain sophisticated strategies of decollectivizing employers and state strategies of Oceania in Orwell’s 1984, though there are many limits to such analogies and indeed to the success of decollectivist strategies, due to the contradiction between rhetoric and actions, employees’ exposure to other discourses and the potential for union response and renewal.",

The territorial marginality, which is also social, generates an exclusionary dynamic: formative difficulties, to live in a human environment that shares deficits of all kinds; lack of relationships with different people who can provide clues, contacts, information and recommendations; to feel excluded from the professional, academic and cultural media. The inhabitant in these cases cannot exercise as a citizen, he cannot exercise his formal status (if he has one). In our current culture, it is obvious that everyone has a right to housing. But for many it is not. The end of many social housing politics does not have as main objective the well-being of the population and the right to housing, but the private business and the complicity of complicit and perverse public policy (whatever the initial propaganda intentions). The city as housing is a continuous process, which cannot be left in the exclusive hands of leaders, professionals (architects, town planners, etc.) or promoters and builders. And even less of the banks and landowners. It is organized citizenship that must promote and guide urban dynamics. In this process it must conquer the socially legitimate but not formalized rights or the ones that are, but in fact the majority or broad sectors of the population cannot exercise them, as is the case of a decent and integrated housing in the city.",

In all cases, community self-organization provided good conditions to overcome crisis and led to desirable changes regarding the problem in question. We explored the underlying mechanisms of successful community self-organization from a social-ecological and community resilience standpoint and identified six elements in common: ability and/or willingness to find opportunities in crisis; partnerships with external actors; human and social capital within the community; generation of income opportunities and/or guarantee of rights; existence of spaces that favor social interaction; and agency oriented to collective mobilization and problem solving. Elements were interconnected and often reinforced one another, generating amplifying feedback, which is seen in the repetition and improvement of practices and attitudes over time and space. Agency was a prominent catalyst for self-organization by generating amplifying feedback that positively affected other elements; it was an element of the feedback chain reinforced by the benefits reaped at the individual level. When collective interests prevailed over individual ones, it was less likely to generate feedback that inhibited self-organization. We argued that ordinary relationships related to different cultural practices and livelihoods were important exercises of collective action that provided communities with a repertoire of responses that could be activated in times of crisis, thus enhancing their capacity to self-organize.",

      "title": "Consumer Credit and Debt",
      "abstract": "Consumer debt refers to (1) household (as opposed to corporate or sovereign) debt that is (2) acquired with the purpose of purchasing consumer goods or services (as opposed to, for instance, micro-credit for business purposes) and (3) owed towards financial institutions and retail entities (as opposed to, for instance, family members, the state, or universities) (4) through a credit contract (as opposed to unpaid bills or overdue rent). In the legal sense, consumer credit only refers to unsecured debt (e.g., payday loans, credit card debt, car purchase loans, consumer loans); however, in the sociological literature, it is used more broadly to include also secured debt, such as home equity loans and mortgages. The social studies of consumer credit and debt draw on economic sociology, economic geography, political economy, organization theory, cultural sociology, and economic anthropology to examine the social, political, and cultural causes and consequences of indebtedness. The wider theoretical concern of this inquiry is not debt per se, but to understand how debt changes our answers to long-standing sociological questions relating to inequality, social relations, cultural change, power, and the connections between economy and society. This review starts with general-scope sociological (General Overviews) and social history (Social History of Credit and Debt) studies on debt, which explicate the broader sociological and cultural significance of widespread indebtedness. The review then covers the two main strands of the social study of credit and debt. The first focuses on the institutional causes of indebtedness, examining macropolitical and cultural shifts (Debt and Cultural Theory), economic policy and institutional differences across countries (Political Economy of Credit and Debt), meso-level, institutional processes (Making of Credit Markets: Institutions and Fields), and the development of credit products and credit scoring within financial institutions (Inside Financial Institutions: Banks and the Lending Process). The second angle focuses on borrowers, looking at the consequences of indebtedness on social inequalities (Credit, Debt, and Inequality); at the credit process—how households borrow, how it changes their everyday life, how they are affected by payment difficulties—unpacking the way debt impacts subjectivities, social relationships, and oppression through lived experiences (Borrowers and the Credit Process); and at opportunities for resistance (Debt Resistance, Financial Dissent, and the New Politics of Finance). This review does not include student debt and microfinance because they are technically not consumer credit; nor does it include mortgage-backed securities, which are not credit products in themselves, but credit derivatives.",

      "title": "How demographic processes shape animal social networks",
      "abstract": "Abstract Demographic processes play a key role in shaping the patterns of social relations among individuals in a population. Social network analysis is a powerful quantitative tool for assessing the social structure formed by associations between individuals. However, demographic processes are rarely accounted for in such analyses. Here, we summarize how the structure of animal social networks is shaped by the joint effects of social behavior and turnover of individuals and suggest how a deeper understanding of these processes can open new, exciting avenues for research. Death or dispersal can have the direct effect of removing an individual and all its social connections, and can also have indirect effects, spurring changes in the distribution of social connections between remaining individuals. Recruitment and integration of juveniles and immigrant into existing social networks are critical to the emergence and persistence of social network structure. Together, these behavioral responses to loss and gain of social partners may impact how societies respond to seasonal or catastrophic turnover events. The fitness consequences of social position (e.g., survival and reproductive rates) may also create feedback between the social network structure and demography. Understanding how social structure changes in response to turnover of individuals requires further integration between long-term field studies and network modeling methods. These efforts will likely yield new insights into the connections between social networks and life history, ecological change, and evolutionary dynamics.",

Prosocial behavior is a helpful action taht benefits other people without necessarily providing any direct benefits to the person performing the act, and may even involve a risk for the person who helps (Baron, Bryne&Branscombe,2006).\r\nAdolescent with visual impairments may experience problems in relating with others and may influence their psychosocial development (Kef, 1999; Sacks & Wolffe, 2006), but instincts as social beings are expected to support its prosocial orientation. Prosocial orientation has a major role in an individual's social cpmpetence (Rydell, Hagekull & Bohlin,1997). Social competence defined as a set of skills and behaviors necessary to get along with others and be well-liked(Anderson and Messick 1974; Cavell 1990, Dodge 1985; Gresham 1986; Rubin and Rose-Krasnor 1992).\r\nTherefore, social competencies needed by adolescents, even though they have physical limitations such as individuals with visual impairments. Sixty-six adolescents (15 female) with visual impairments and seventy-one (25 female) typically developed adolscent participated in this study to reveal the prosocial orientation in adolscent as a control group in this study. This research is conducted to enriched the understanding of social behavior in visually impaired adolescents in Indonesia. This research implies that y knowing their prosocial abilities, adolescent with visual impairments, are expected to develop their social competence optimally even with their disabilities and society would pay more attention toward them.",

It refers to a person's or group's borrowing ways of thinking (ideas) and ways of doing things (procedures) from other cultures to solve specific problems. Pragmatic acculturation is usually but not exclusively found in ethnically plural societies and it is conceptually different from acculturation or assimilation usually defined as “the process by which an outsider, immigrant, or subordinate group becomes indistinguishably integrated into the dominant host society” (Marshall 1996: 20; Kovacks &amp; Cropley 1975: 10). In contrast to acculturation, the notion of “culture borrowing” in pragmatic acculturation is more than just a “movement of things among societies”; it encompasses patterns of behavior and attitudes. The concept pragmatic acculturation in comparative sociological research contributes to an effective understanding of the permeability of cultural boundaries and its effect on various aspects of social life; of the permanent or temporary transformation in belief systems; and of the way cultural beliefs and norms influence accounts of social life processes and events such as work productivity, governance styles, or disease incidence and prevalence across communities and countries.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The term “institution” and several variants are used frequently in the literature on metropolitan water management. The state‐of‐the art investigation on which this paper is based revealed that 1) many uses of the term do not include careful definitions; 2) many users of the term seemed unaware of the general, theoretical literature on the subject of institutions; 3) there was little consistency among uses, either in the practical literature dealing with water or in the conceptual literature dealing with theories of institutions or institutionalization; 4) some usages were without significant meaning; 5) in many cases the term was used as a kind of “black box” to account for behavioral, societal, or managerial factors; 6) the term was often used as a synonym for “organization”. This latter use is frequently found in federal reports, including National Water Commission studies, and is most unfortunate because it tends to slight significant social‐psychological factors. A suggested definition is: “An institution is the structured result or outcome of a process by which values are articulated, arranged, and communicated, having continuity over time, and influencing behavior of persons who did not necessarily participate in formulating those values (norms).”",

      "title": "Language Shapes Socially Constructed Gender Roles: Ibsen’s ‘A Doll’s House’ in Focus",
      "abstract": "Language plays an important role in human life that can be seen from various perspectives such as the cultural perspective, linguistic perspective, social perspective, psychological perspective, perspective of gender and moral and ethical perspectives. This is undoubtedly a proven fact that we use language and at the same time, language uses us to define, designate, tag and shape our places in the society (Cameron, 2005). This role of language is generally suitable for all human race either male or female but the basic purpose of this study is to explain how language shapes a woman’s place and identity in society. Often we find that women face linguistic discrimination in two different ways: one is the way; they are taught to speak and use language and the other way is about how language treats them (Lakoff, 2004). These linguistic disparities tend to specify a woman’s role and function in the society as a sex object, a servant, a wife, a daughter, a mother and specifically a woman (Kerber, 1988). The researcher collected the data for this study from Ibsen’s (1999) ‘A Doll’s House’ in which different lexical items, phrases and sentences were uttered intentionally to explain the role of the main character Nora as a wife, as a daughter and as a woman. The researcher examined the speeches of different characters only to show the language –made and man- made places of women in the society. For this purpose, the researcher used a theoretical framework based on the qualitative approach while consulting the related ideas of Lakoff (2004) who, in her ‘Dominance Theory,’ explains how language shapes a woman’s place in the society by analyzing her own speeches and the speeches of different people in the society. The findings of the study go a long way in telling people and the upcoming researchers that language not only specifies gender roles individually, but also internally and externally as well. Basically different social characters surrounding a woman use language in such a way that it starts shaping a woman’s character in different sub- characters as explained in the work of Ibsen (1999). Furthermore, language use tells us that a man remains a man in every situation either as a father, as a husband, as a son, and above all as a man but a woman’s place in society is changeable according to language use and those tagged names that men have used for women ever. For example, if a little girl talks roughly like a boy, she is scolded by her parents and friends (Lakoff, 2004). This process of socialization is harmful in the sense that it is making women weak, incapable and less –confident but if we analyze the last lines spoken by Nora in the selected text of Ibsen (1999), we come to know that constant battering and hammering of socialization and generalization are now making women aware of their individual place and identity in the society and they are now looking at life from a different perspective that is still unacceptable in the man-made society (Kramer, 1974). This study will open new avenues for sociolinguists to study language and gender keenly and critically.",

The description develops existing descriptions by showing how the use of an honorific or a plain form functions in interaction as a societal action which situates the interaction within the societal norms of seniority, acquaintance/affiliation and (in)formality. The analysis in the framework of Austin’s ([1962]1975) effect-based speech act theory is illustrated using several examples which show that there is an interplay between performing an illocutionary-act type and performing a societal action: illocutionary and perlocutionary effects are reinforced when the illocutionary-act type and the societal action are compatible; but mitigated illocutionary and perlocutionary effects result when they are incompatible.",

      "abstract": "The necessary conditions for the evolution of social behaviors in a population with three levels of biological organization are derived by using a population genetic model (one locus, two alleles, random mating, discrete generations). Total selection on the behavior, Deltaq, is partitioned into the sum of three components: (i) Deltaq(I), selection between individuals within families; (ii) Deltaq(F), selection between families within groups; and (iii) Deltaq(G), selection between groups of families. I show that any level of selection can be made to operate in concert with or in opposition to any other, depending upon the fitness effects of the behavior. The implications of the model are discussed in relation to those adaptive explanations of phenotypic traits that generally consider selection to operate only between individuals.",

Por meio da violência, os jovens manifestantes expressam seu inconformismo com o desemprego, o fracasso escolar e outros sintomas da discriminação de que se julgam vítimas, inclusive por parte da polícia. A passagem do estado de natureza até o estado social produz no homem uma mudança bem acentuada, substituindo, em sua conduta, o instinto pelo sentimento de justiça, e outorgando a suas ações relações morais que antes estavam ausentes. À medida que a repressão se intensifique, fica ainda mais difícil a percepção da realidade. A França, como sociedade pode converter-se em uma ameaça a si própria ao não combinar integração e diferenças socioeconômicas, superando a oposição entre um modelo republicano e um comunitarismo carregado de agressividade. A América Latina vivenciou uma longa era de repressão militar, de violência, oprimida por um Estado distante dos indivíduos; incapaz de suprí-los com políticas públicas e sociais. Na sociedade civil é onde surgem e se desenvolvem os conflitos econômicos, sociais, ideológicos, religiosos, que as instituições públicas têm o dever de equacionar.",

Clearly, the focus of both approaches is on individuals — their psychological processes, developmental history or differences from one another. Where social events are considered it is usually either to fill out the picture of individuality (e.g. the effects of socialisation on the development of the individual child), or it is in small-scale contexts where the interaction of individuals can be examined (e.g. studies of small groups or families). Attempts to employ psychological and psychoanalytic approaches to throw light on fully social phenomena have been relatively few, although, at least in the case of psychoanalysis, some of these attempts have been quite influential — notably Freud's (1930) account of the relationship between individual repression and cultural development and the 'Freudo-Marxist' analyses of such writers as Reich, Fromm and Marcuse (see Frosh, 1987).",

In such settings, individuals often lack insight into what interaction partners deem fair and appropriate, potentially seeding misunderstandings, frustration, and conflict. Here, we examine how individuals decipher distinct rules of engagement and adapt their behavior to reach agreements with partners from other cultural groups. Modeling individuals as Bayesian learners with inequality aversion reveals that individuals, in repeated ultimatum bargaining with responders sampled from different groups, can be more generous than needed. While this allows them to reach agreements, it also gives rise to biased beliefs about what is required to reach agreement with members from distinct groups. Preregistered behavioral ( N = 420) and neuroimaging experiments ( N = 49) support model predictions: Seeking equitable agreements can lead to overly generous behavior toward partners from different groups alongside incorrect beliefs about prevailing norms of what is appropriate in groups and cultures other than one’s own.",

In this paper I show how placing embodied human agents at the center of communicative organizing processes affords considerable promise for theorizing the sociomaterial basis of communication, and consequently of organizing processes more generally. I do this by augmenting Yates & Orlikowski’s (1992) genre approach with a materially-embodied perspective on non-verbal communicative organizing – by “fleshing out” the genre approach with Goffman’s (1963) situational view of social interaction. Results of this endeavor contribute to knowledge in the areas of materiality and organizing, communication and organizing, and the study of embodied social practices across levels of analysis.",

      "title": "Community-based approaches to peacebuilding in conflict-affected and fragile contexts",
      "abstract": "The impact of violent conflict and fragility on a country’s society, economy and political governance is devastating and encompassing. The effects can be tangible and visible, including killed and injured civilians, destroyed or derelict bridges and wells, and damaged or inadequate health and education facilities. They can also be intangible, such as the collapse of state institutions, mistrust in government, the destruction of social relationships, psychological trauma and pervasive fear. Addressing both types of effects are essential in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. \nThe ‘community’ has often proven to be resilient in such contexts, providing survival and coping mechanisms for insecurity and fragility. Experience has shown that even in areas of sheer desolation, social life and organisational systems can readily re-emerge within community networks. (Pouligny, 2005) Growing attention has thus been paid in recent years to the adoption of community-based approaches to help address the extensive needs in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. Fragile contexts are situations in which ‘state structures lack political will and/or capacity to provide the basic functions needed for poverty reduction, development and to safeguard the security and human rights of their population’. (OECD DAC, 2007) Conflict-affected contexts encompass situations prior to, during and after armed conflict. \nThis paper explores the rationale behind community-based approaches; and key issues, challenges and considerations in designing and implementing such approaches. It highlights overarching issues across sectors and country-contexts, with particular focus on implications specific to conflict-affected and fragile contexts. Section one provides an overview of community-based approaches to peacebuilding, including a brief look at typology and community institutions. Section two outlines the key aims of community-based approaches and how these aims are approached. It also discusses the various challenges in fulfilling these aims and how these challenges can be addressed. Section three highlights key considerations in the planning, execution and monitoring of community-based approaches, including the set up of participatory, community institutions and funding mechanisms. Section four examines issues of sustainability. In particular, it discusses linking community processes to government in order to ensure greater impact and consolidation of community-based interventions. The final section provides an annotated bibliography of specific case studies and evaluations of community-based approaches, highlighting lessons learned and policy recommendations.",

Las principales tendencias relacionadas con esta problematica revelan que las asimetrias tienden a agudizarse y que las percepciones de la opinion publica cada vez se distancian mas de los diagnosticos y los tratamientos que se realizan desde las esferas del poder, con el resultado de un aumento progresivo de la exclusion social, por un lado, y de los climas de apatia politica y deterioro social, por otro.

Moreover, it increasingly acknowledges that formal inclusion is no guarantee of real participation in practice, as the “discursive hierarchies” within civic engagement structure relative access for some people over others (Fraser 1992: 118; Young 2000: 38-40; Warner 2002; Dahlberg 2005: 114). More than merely the predominance of a specific speech culture, exclusions are also effected by forms of epistemic violence that can essentialize, appropriate, and conflate difference seeking entry into politics (Spivak 1987). Those who, as Homi Bhabha states, have been “overlooked ‐ in the double sense of social surveillance and psychic disavowal ‐ and, at the same time, overdetermined ‐ psychically projected, made stereotypical and symptomatic” ‐ must find ways to communicate that can contend with and do not lend themselves easily to these pressures",

Our results showed that infants found it harder to memorize dominance relations that were presented in an order that hindered the incremental formation of a single structure (Study 1). These results suggest that infants attempt to build structures incrementally, relation by relation, thereby simplifying the complex problem of recognizing a social structure. Infants also found circular dominance structures harder to process than linear dominance structures (Study 2). These expectations about the shape of structures may facilitate learning. Our results suggest that infants attempt to represent social structures composed of social relations. They indicate that human infants go beyond learning about individual social partners and their respective relations and form hypotheses about how social groups are organized.",

      "title": "How Bureaucracies Address Complex Social Issues",
      "abstract": "Organizations—including bureaucratic ones—are increasingly confronted with complex social issues for which there are no clear solutions. Public bureaucracies are called upon for multiple tasks, including the framing of social problems, the deployment of public resources, and the collective mobilization of non-state actors, all the way down to the delivery of essential public services. Similarly, large, private, bureaucratic organizations’ operations often span the globe and are enmeshed in the perpetuation of issues—from environmental degradation to modern-day slavery—while also holding the potential for catalyzing change given their resources and reach. While these issues fueled research in organization theory and public administration, there has been relatively little theoretical engagement across fields. We believe this is a missed opportunity. Understanding how bureaucracies can address complex social problems requires more systematic interdisciplinary conversations. This panel symposium will engage a group of scholars working across organizational theory and public administration in interactive discussions around the following topics: (1) the variety of organizational forms and practices of bureaucracy that facilitate or constrain its ability to address complex social issues; (2) how bureaucratic organizations interact with their wider contexts to build and sustain collective action for tackling complex social problems; (3) how concepts and findings in organizational theory and public administration research can better inform one another to generate a more robust understanding of bureaucracy and its relationship with social issues. By bringing together scholars across fields, we hope the symposium will stimulate synergies and enhance the impact of the scholarship on emerging challenges for organizations, management, and society.",

      "abstract": "Cultural identity has become increasingly important and complex within many contemporary globalized societies. Consequently, methodological development is needed to expand our conceptualization and measurement of (a) the formation and experiences of multiple nested cultural identities and (b) how such identities relate to psychosocial functioning. In the preregistered and experimental quantitative phase (Study 1), Danish participants (n = 308) were divided into three subsamples completely at random and exposed to various priming regarding global events (i.e., COVID-19, war in Ukraine, or a control prompt not related to current events). Danish, European, and global cultural identities were all highly endorsed across our sample, and global identity was enhanced by priming related to the war in Ukraine as compared with the other two priming conditions. Danish cultural identity was positively associated with well-being (self-esteem and life satisfaction) both directly and indirectly through self-concept clarity, whereas European identity was negatively associated with self-concept clarity, and global identity was positively associated with self-esteem. In the qualitative phase (Study 2), with a selected subsample of the Study 1 sample (n = 5), we conducted in-depth semistructured interviews to explore the experience of sociohistorically embedded cultural identities (i.e., shaped by a complex interplay of culture, language, and social practices) within the globalized context of Denmark. Results highlight ideographic understandings of cultural identities and how these identities are politically embedded and shaped through intercultural experiences and events. These results are discussed in terms of how multi-method approaches can enhance our understanding of contemporary complex cultural identities.",

Sin embargo, a pesar de los avances que se han obtenido en los últimos años tanto en lo académico como en la práctica empresarial, el término oscila entre dos opuestos y crea una dicotomía de la responsabilidad social empresarial (RSE). Este trabajo explora algunas de las ideas opuestas dentro de la literatura actual de dicho concepto y argumenta que la dialéctica presentada en los debates ha generado una diversificación del conocimiento y actividades que realizan las empresas relacionadas con aspectos sociales y ambientales, lo que genera posturas encontradas. No obstante, puede existir un área común en la cual las ideas converjan y proporcionen una respuesta a la cada vez más difícil implementación correcta del concepto de RSE.",

      "abstract": "Bearing in mind the image of the homeless functioning in our society, a thesis can be presented that it is not the fact of being homeless that causes social exclusion of people experiencing homelessness, but the perception of the homeless by others and the resulting social reactions towards them. Beresford proposes among others: focusing activity on the disabling society; overcoming division into service users and service providers, and; encouraging participation of service users in social work, education, practice, and research (Beresford, 2014). Participative practices co-created with people experiencing homelessness through the implemented research and projects reflect the above postulates. Thanks to the involvement of various social entities, they break the stereotypes about homeless people; they overcome divisions between service users and providers, blurring the borders between them due to the implemented activities; finally, they involve service users in different aspects of lives, including the practice, as they become experts in their needs and undertaken activities, they join to help others or initiate such help, thus sometimes it is hard to tell a volunteer from a project participant. The objective of this text is to reconstruct the activities increasing the participative potential of the implemented research and projects. In the text I present the nature of socially involved research conducted by me. Then I discuss the efforts undertaken in order to boost the participative potential of the implemented research and projects, on the basis of specific actions promoting voluntary and subjective decisions about getting involved, a diagnosis of participative needs, the inclusion of wider society groups to participative practices, or the participative impact on a structurally conditioned situation of people experiencing homelessness.",

Associations dedicated to disability, who treat, educate, train, insert, support, and those who, in their sports, cultural, or artistic activities, include a disability part, obviously play a major role in that approach. Unexpected spin-offs of the compensation of disability can be seen: the adaptability of some space to the needs and constraints of a person with a loss of autonomy is not a simple respect of law as regards accessibility.",

The reasons for granting social assistance may be grouped into categories (Sierpowska 2009: 58) that cover. for example, an individual's financial situation ar health status. In this article we combine categories: difficulties in adapting and integrating with addictions, because in many cases they are closely connected (all of them require taking additional actions to achieve integration) and the consequences for local social policies are similar (for example, increased risk of pathological ar criminal behavior associated with occurrence of the social problem). Contemporary societies in particular exhibit increasing evidence of social marginalii)/ [which] may not only be the result of a lack of this ar that right, but also a question of the practical impossibility of carrying aut those authorizations (Frieske 2003). Such is the case with these categories as wali. For, there ara situations where it is not possible for the people involved in them to use their rights ar resolve their problems independently (ar with the help of the people closest to them) in order to overcome a difficult situation in life. In the case of the selected categories, the situation can only be rectified through assistance that is specifically adapted to resolve those selected problems. However, early action can result in significant savings, actual resolution ot the problem and relatively rapid social integration. In the case of the situations described above, help is provided in practice at the district level, while in the case of individuals released tram prison ar of assistance due to alcoholism, assistance is initially provided by the commune. In cases where foreigners have obtained refugee ar subsidiary protection status in the Republic of Poland and are having difficulties integrating, ar cases where individuals are having difficulties adjusting to life after being released from prison, social assistance is directed towards a clearly defined group within the larger group of all beneficiaries.

Many of the ideas conflict; very few have been tested for complete validity under all conditions. Most of the laws have an economic bias, neglecting many of the fundamentals of the standard of living from the sociological viewpoint. The analyses have been largely biased by the assumption of an immediate reaction between an individual and his present consumption goods without relation to long-time or non-sensational points of view. Thirty-six theoretical formulations may be grouped under: (1) food budgets, (2) clothing budgets, (3) rent, fuel and housing budgets, (4) budgets of sundry items, (5) investment expenditures.",

However, the point of departure must be the community. It is at the community level that the problems of living conditions are discussed, and interactions with other communities are elicited (Servaes 1999; 2003). It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional “receivers” (→ Models of Communication). Paulo Freire (1983, 76) refers to this as the right of all people to individually and collectively speak their word: “This is not the privilege of some few men, but the right of every (wo)man. Consequently, no one can say a true word alone – nor can he say it for another, in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words” (→ Freedom of Communication).",

      "title": "Participation and media",
      "abstract": "Participation is a highly fluid and contested notion, or a concept that can be called – following Laclau and Mouffe (1985) – an empty signifier. In practice, this means that – as Pateman (1970: 1) puts it – ‘the widespread use of the term [...] has tended to mean that any precise, meaningful content has almost disappeared; “participation” is used to refer to a wide variety of different situations by different people’. It is tempting to see this process of the emptying of the signifier participation as a neutral event or as an accident of history. A more critical analysis shows that this is actually an ideological process, which aims (or threatens) to remove the more radical meanings from the concept of participation. Attempts to counter this softening-down of (the signifier) participation have been based on the construction of dichotomized systems of meaning. In these dichotomies, specific forms of participation are described as ‘real’ and ‘authentic’, while other forms are described as ‘fake’ and ‘pseudo’. In the field of so-called political participation, for example, Verba (1961: 220–221) points to the existence of ‘pseudo-participation’, in which the emphasis is not on creating a situation in which participation is possible, but on creating the feeling that participation is possible. An alternative name, which is among others used by Strauss (1998: 18), is ‘manipulative participation’ [1]. An example of an author working within the tradition of participatory communication who uses terms as ‘genuine’ and ‘authentic participation’ is Servaes. In his Communication for development (1999), he writes that this ‘real’ form of participation has to be seen as participation ‘[that] directly addresses power and its distribution in society. It touches the very core of power relationships’ (Servaes, 1999: 198; my emphasis). Moreover, this shows how crucial power is to the definition of participation, as is also emphasized by White (1994: 17):",

Typically, these approaches invoke micro-mechanisms to explain macro-social phenomena. Most of them, \"analytical sociology\" in particular (Hedström 2005), are versions or offshoots of methodological individualism. These individualistic approaches either stick to the \"methodological\" in \"methodological individualism\" and leave aside ontological issues, or else they are also individualistic in the metaphysical sense and deny the existence of supra-individual social phenomena that cannot be analyzed in terms of the aggregation of individual actions (see Ruben 1985).",

Por otra parte, sin embargo, se sabe que el concepto de calidad es dificil de definir, a causa de su caracter multidimensional y relativo. Si bien la eficacia (la relacion entre los efectos observados y los efectos esperados) y la eficiencia (la relacion entre los efectos observados y la inversion realizada) son dos componentes esenciales de la calidad, tambien es posible que una educacion superior sea eficaz y eficiente sin ser pertinente socialmente, dado que los efectos deseados y observados no sirven a la sociedad. Hay quien cree que si anadimos un tercer concepto, que es el de equidad, podrian tenerse en consideracion las necesidades de la sociedad. Efectivamente, un sistema educativo (y, por lo tanto, una institucion de educacion superior) seria mucho mas equitativo cuanto mas independientes fueran los beneficios que pudieran extraerse de el en relacion con las caracteristicas de las personas (sexo, origen social, cultural, etnico, economico, geografico...). Esta claro que es un nuevo paso importante hacia adelante, pero que no es suficiente. La tesis aqui defendida se resume en pocas palabras: el criterio primero y ultimo para evaluar la educacion superior es la pertinencia social. No obstante, es preciso fijar bien sus limites y no restringirlo a una concepcion centrada exclusivamente en el desarrollo economico, como dan a entender algunos discursos.",

Whereas actions operate historically, interactions provide the events retrospectively with meaning. Luhmann’s sociology of communication systems adds to the approach of symbolic interactionism the question of what global dimensions of communication mean for local interactions. When communication is functionally differentiated — for example, in terms of media — tensions can be expected to develop between local organizations and global developments of communication structures. Interfaces enable us to translate selectively among (provisionally) stabilized representations, for example, in professional practices. \"Big science\" and \"high tech\" can be considered as organizational acculturations of an emerging level of sophistication in global communications. The global dimension remains a hypothesis, but entertaining this hypothesis of \"globalization\" restructures the local expectations.",

Here organizational or professional identities are seen as co-creative accomplishments and as socially negotiated phenomena that come into being in the complex and subtle discursive storymaking processes that are continuously (re)constituting organizational practice. From this view organizations are perceived as fascinating, subtle and everchanging storymaking ecologies that are constantly (re)communicated or story-made into being in complex interplay between various entangled storymaking layers, that is: 1) situated small stories, 2) organizational narratives, and 3) societal narratives. The former small stories emerge and circulate in diverse situated organizational practices and the latter two narrative levels can be seen as the results of small story efforts that have crystallized over time through retrospective sense-making processes (Bager & Lundholt, 2021; Bager & McClellan, in press; Bager & McClellan, accepted). From an organizational small storymaking (OSS) approach organizational identities are seen as continuously and collectively worked up in local situations through ongoing positioning activities invoking and engendering these three entangled storymaking layers. Hence, an OSS perspective allows us to reflect how organizational identity work unfold in the schism between local social interaction and the macro social processes in which it is embedded.",

According to Azar and colleagues, protracted social conflicts (PSCs) are a mixture of socioethnic and interstate elements that defy traditional settlement methods, and generate escalating perceptions and behaviors. Because crises are managed to restore the status quo and keep conflict at only a moderate intensity, the conflicts take on an inertial or even ‘frozen’ quality, lacking any resolution despite repeated attempts at settlement. PSCs also involve deep-seated religious, racial and ethnic animosities that set these conflicts apart from those not involving group identities and the rights asserted and sought through these (Azar and Farah, 1981).",

      "abstract": "Our comparative analysis of digital forms of participatory budgeting in Brazil, Indonesia and Switzerland shows that their impact is limited. The digital implementation of participatory budgeting processes neither achieves a widespread dissemination of participation processes nor improves their intensity. In many cases, the participatory processes are symbolic despite digital elements. It therefore remains to be seen whether the introduction of digital elements can sustainably counteract the declining participation in participatory budget processes. <strong>Abstrakt</strong> Partizipative Budgetierung ist der Versuch, Bürger:innen stärker in finanzpolitische Entscheidungsprozesse einzubeziehen. Diese entstehen traditionell wenig im Austausch mit den direktbetroffenen Bürger:innen und genügen daher den normativen Anforderungen einer partizipativen Demokratie nur selten. Digitale Partizipationsmöglichkeiten bieten die Möglichkeit, mehrere Probleme klassischer Mitwirkungsverfahren (Zeit, Beteiligung, Sprache, Machtasymmetrien) zu überwinden. Andererseits entstehen durch den vermehrten Einsatz der digitalen Partizipation neue Herausforderungen und Risiken (z.B. fehlende Interaktion, rechtliche Bestimmungen). Es ist daher eine empirische Frage, ob digitale Formen der Mitwirkung im Bereich der öffentlichen Budgetierung an Bedeutung gewinnen werden oder nicht. Wir beleuchten spezifisch die Erfahrungen mit digitalen Formen partizipativer Budgetprozesse in zwei ausgewählten Schwellenländern (Indonesien und Brasilien) und kontrastieren diese Ergebnisse mit dem Budgetierungsprozess in der Schweiz, wo Entscheidungen in der Regel auf kommunaler Ebene (zumindest in kleineren und mittelgrossen Gemeinden) ebenfalls partizipativ an Gemeindeversammlungen, aber bisher kaum digital getroffen werden. Insgesamt ist festzustellen, dass die Wirkung der digitalen partizipativen Budgetprozesse in den drei untersuchten Ländern beschränkt ist, da mit der digitalen Durchführung von partizipativen Budgetprozessen weder eine flächendeckende Verbreitung der Beteiligungsprozesse erreicht noch deren Intensität verbessert werden kann. In vielen Fällen sind die Beteiligungsprozesse trotz digitaler Elemente symbolisch, und im Vergleich zu traditionellen Verfahren verzichten digitale Budgetprozesse weitgehend auf die partizipative Projektideengenerierungsphase. Zudem bleibt abzuwarten, ob die Einführung digitaler Elemente der zurückgehenden Beteiligung an partizipativen Budgetprozessen nachhaltig entgegenwirken kann oder ob digitale Budgetprozesse nur vorübergehende Effekte hervorbringen. <strong>Résumé</strong> Dans notre analyse comparative des formes digitales de budgétisation participative au Brésil, en Indonésie et en Suisse, il apparaît que leur impact est limité. La mise en oeuvre digitale des processus budgétaires participatifs ne permet pas d’atteindre une diffusion des processus de participation ni d’en améliorer l’intensité. Dans de nombreux cas, les processus participatifs restent symboliques malgré les éléments digitaux. Il reste donc à voir si les éléments digitaux peuvent contrer durablement le déclin de la participation aux processus budgétaires participatifs. <strong>Schlüsselwörter:</strong> Bürgerhaushalt; Digitalisierung; E-Partizipation; E-Governance; Partizipation; Inklusion; öffentliche Finanzverwaltung <strong>Mots-clés:</strong> budget participatif; digitalisation; participation digitale; gouvernance digitale; participation; inclusion; gestion des finances publiques",

Social work has blossomed out from a philanthropic movement into a profession; in the field of mental health the emphasis has shifted from custody and nursing to treatment, prevention and after-care; new methods of treatment have been developed in the field of child welfare. Community organization, training in an industrial setting and adult education are also being tackled more professionally on the basis of extensive practice theory and an increasing use of scientific insights. Although these -and other areas -are usually seen as related (the helping professions) what they have in common is rarely defined. With the concept 'planned change' as applicable to education and re-education in the widest sense as starting point, we believe that these areas share the characteristics listed below: 1. the activities are planned; this can be seen from the distinction of phases if planned change (planning intervention -evaluation); 2. the intervention is usually based on social-technical strategies; 3. the 'change-agent' is a professional and independent psycho-social system (individual, group or organization); 4. the 'client system' is also a psycho-social system (individual, group, organization or community); 5. the relation between change-agent and client system is one of functional cooperation; 6. the aims are to induce changes in the client system, i.e. improvement of the psycho-social structure and/or the functioning of the client system. 7. the operational objectives are selected from the values of the client system in so far as they are not at odds with the fundamental values of the society to which the change-agent and client system belong.",

In fact, language question creates tension in the society. The choice of one or more languages is capable to crystalise antagonisms in the regions. Each region must develop their languages in their territory to avoid linguistic crisis and tension that can lead to social, political, economic instability in the country.  However, there is no ideal language planning but political stakeholders must analyse language from linguistic, social milieu and study their social functions as well as their linguistic needs in the society before developing them.",

Social and production relations are modeled as separate repeated strategic interactions. \"Linking\" them--by employing members of the same community or by encouraging social interaction between employees--is shown to facilitate cooperation in production: (a) because of available \"Social Capital,\" the slack of net expected gains from cooperation in the social relations which can be credibly transferred to discipline behavior in the workplace; (b) because payoffs from the social and production relations tend to be substitutes, in which case the linkage of more relations endogenously generates Social Capital (a sort of \"increasing returns in cooperation\"); (c) because the linkage generates transfers of \"trust,\" reputation spillovers from a cooperative social background to newly started production relations; and (d) because agents who share social relations have access to additional information about each other's situations.",

      "abstract": "Residents, academics, and policy makers frequently believe that certain neighbourhood compositions impact on opportunities of those who are exposed to them. Social outcomes such as those connected to employment, levels of education and income and the risk of becoming involved in illegal activity, are frequently seen as influenced by the neighbourhood one is living in. However, isolating the so-called 'neighbourhood effect' on social outcomes from other impacts on these outcomes is not trivial. In this chapter we address some of the challenges researchers and policy makers are confronted with when getting involved in 'neighbourhood effects' debates. Challenges include conceptual issues related to the types of contexts (residential, work, school) and types of compositions (social or other); questions related to the scales to consider, and how to approach the temporal dimension; issues about what mechanisms would produce the effects; and methodological issues (data types, model choices, sources of bias, detecting thresholds).",

      "abstract": "Despite the advanced use of images in our society, we have little understanding of how pictures are produced by the individual and the mental processes they demand. In this study,' visual representations and childhood egocentricity were explored to see how young children found their simple representations adequate and sufficient at one time and then progressively increased their own demands for comprehensibility, accommodating to the perspective of the viewer. Pictorial representation requires using one thing to stand for another. Because adults have known the rules of representation so long, the need for learning rules and the possible alternative actions are not easy for them to recognize. We need to observe how a child arrives at the rules of equivalences that he uses in his drawing. It seems likely that he works on different sets of assumptions than those that adults take for granted. He seems to learn the rules of representation through the practice of drawing in the social context. It has been shown in a variety of domains than art-making that one of the shifts in abilities of the child between the ages of five and seven is role-taking; the capacity to anticipate thoughts of the other in a communication situation (Piaget, 196212; Flavell, 19684; Kraus and Glucksberg, 1966). Given that pictorial representation is an achieved process, and that it must be learned in a social context through usage with others; given also that role-taking is newly-acquired during the ages under study it is valid to examine childhood egocentricity as related to incomprehensibility in drawing. We can expect that, since the child's grasp of the communication si uation changes as he grows, this change affects his use of the drawing medium.",

      "abstract": "School shooting is one of the most difficult challenges for the modern society.Several seemingly irrelevant components -social well-being of the family, a safe community, a relatively non-troublesome child, a wellprotected school building, no apparent motivation -are intertwined within each bloody massacre, but the signs of an upcoming rampage are yet to be identified.According to FBI statistics, active shooters, including school shooters, usually do not stand out from the majority; only a quarter of them have mental issues, in most cases the weapon was obtained legally, the time gap between the trigger event and the rampage is about a year, friends, family, and social services usually do not observe enough warning signs to report, and even in case they do, the situational check brings nothing (Silver, Simons, Craun 2018).Difficulties in identifying possible shooters are explained by the complexity and ambivalence of the prerequisites and their interactions.These include violence in the environment, observed hate, prejudice, or humiliating attitudes towards particular social groups, fierce competition, physical form and appearance issues, approval of weapons within the society, public attention to previous school shooters, school environment, and parenting issues.However, any of those factors may be present in people and groups who had never planned and would never plan a crime.School shootings prediction and prevention are impossible without identifying the intersections of the most indicative risk factors and studying every intersection within its unique context.The article aims to identify the most common factors contributing to the school shooting phenomenon using the social-ecological model framework.Within four levels examined by the social-ecological model -societal, community, relationship, and individual -the most significant factors are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Over a million cases of infected people, thresholds and dramatic records constantly exceeded, the voices of the State and of the civil society covering each other in search of validation, an alienated and disoriented population – this is the general picture of a Romanian society trying, on one side, to understand a global phenomenon and, on the other side, to adapt to situations, norms and regulations that has not been encountered for generations. In an effervescent social, economic and political context, the Coronavirus pandemic tests the whole society and forces the State to react, both through concrete measures (rules, restrictions) and through education and awareness campaigns. The official messages transmitted by the State, through the media and in the form of commercials, advertisements, are subject to an evolution in visual and verbal aspect, which can be questioned both in terms of philosophical theories such as utilitarianism or social contract, and from the semiotic perspective of the meanings carried by these messages. How is the \"common good\" found in the education and awareness campaigns for wearing protective masks and for frequent sanitation and disinfection? And if Rousseau's \"common good\" is not fully visible in the mask that \"can save your life,\" is the general goal of the government campaign one of a utilitarian nature? To what extent does the promise of the presence of pleasure and the absence of pain appear, as described by John Stuart Mill, in a campaign built on \"saving lives\" and \"protecting others\"? This research advances the proposition of a perception analysis of the meanings conveyed in the television commercials from the official awareness and education campaign regarding the Coronavirus pandemic, between March 2020 and January 2021, decanted in terms of basic semiotic and philosophical concepts and theories.",

En consecuencia la responsabilidad social y medioambiental de un EM puede necesitar de estrategias diferenciadas segun el contexto institucional y economico en los distintos paises. El caracter de interdependencia entre variables de mercado o economicas (de produccion y comercializacion de bienes y servicios), variables institucionales y su desarrollo relativo ha generado una dinamica de acciones positivas en terminos de responsabilidad social y medioambiental a nivel internacional (especialmente en paises menos desarrollados) conducentes a la generacion de codigos de conducta avalados por organismos internacionales, ONG, organizaciones empresariales y sindicales y por EMs concretas.

This chapter provides an overview of community work within the context of social work. Most of the initiative for social welfare rested with the private sector. However, because so much of the responsibility for social services in the United Kingdom rests with the public sector the question arises as to whether activities similar to 'community organisation' can operate in the statutory social services. Group work has been highly developed as a method in the USA than in this country. In community organisation and social administration the conception of a 'client' in the casework sense is similarly complicated. A somewhat illogical but nevertheless useful distinction can be made between three major areas of community work: service development or the community work of the direct-service agency; inter-organisational co-ordination and social planning; and work with community groups.",

In most cases, there is not a definitive and wrong; for example, it is often the case that we are dealing with controversial products or sensitive behaviours (e.g., contraceptives and central practices) and/or two principles which are seen to be right by different groups are in conflict (e.g., pro-life versus pro-choice). Further, it is a well recognised fact in social marketing that what we are often dealing with is a trade-off between individual and community good (e.g., the of the individual to smoke a cigarette, which is currently a legal product, versus the of others to be protected from passive smoking).

      "title": "Organizational Social Capital and Performance Management",
      "abstract": "1. IntroductionFinancial limitations and growing citizen demand for first-rate public services (Nica and Potcovaru, 2015a, b, c) have stimulated public administrations to enforce performance-management practices. Social interplay, trust, and shared objectives are extremely significant (Petcu, 2015) if organizations aim to further performance information utilization. Decision-makers in public entities tend to use performance information for steering, controlling, and learning goals if the managers and workers on various organizational levels 1) have the chance to often interact, 2) share trust in each other, and 3) are dedicated to the same objectives. Organizational social capital is significant to make performance management systems function. (Tantardini and Kroll, 2015)2. The Character and Effectiveness of Links and the Communication Flows in which People and Organizations Are EntrenchedAs newcomer learning is an essential element in socialization, the incorporation of cognition is decisive to compr ehending the impacts of social relations (Popescu, 2015a, b) and network relationships on newcomer learning throughout the socialization process. The participants in various network positions have distinctive access to resources and can supply distinct chances and resources to newcomers as they attempt to harmonize with the group. In opposition with the bureaucratic organization of social networks (Devine, 2015), the relational aspect comprises the links among persons in the group. An apparent and relevant component of the socialization process is mastering to do the task in a manner that is consonant with the other components of the entity. Connections have a massive impact on what they can do (operation) and how they perceive (contentment) toward the entity. The consequences of the somewhat imperceptible social systems on persons are significant moderators that facilitate and confine the performance of the organization. (Korte and Lin, 2013) The continuance of organizational social capital furthers the employment of standard performance information. The structural feature of organizational social capital makes data acquirable and promotes the exchange of performance data among the components of an entity (Bondrea and Stefanescu-Mihaila, 2014a, b), therefore boosting its utilization for managerial decision making. If workers team up across departments and communicate on a constant basis, performance information tends to become a component of these cooperation and communication patterns rather t ha n just being announced and categorized. (Tantardini and Kroll, 2015)For the purpose of advancing social capital and actualizing its advantages, workers have to grasp, count on, and reciprocate social capital. The latter, with its incontestable benefits to workers, is instrumental in employees' sense of duty (Nica, 2015a, b) to reward the synergetic and concerted working climate. It is workers whose undertakings eventually establish the degree of social capital in an entity and via whom entities can gain from social capital. Workers' perceptions concerning stability and cohesion impact their assessments of social capital in their entity. Social capital is vulnerable to unpredictability. (Parzefall and Kuppelwieser, 2012) Communications between entities within a social field assist in advancing perceptions and prospects shared by the organizations. As the social interplay develops, trust between an entity and its arrangement of entities grows: organizational interactions can assist in configuring trusting connections with other entities. The cognitive aspect of social capital entails shared values (Mihaila et al., 2016) and common visions between entities. Enhanced social capital between entities makes it mor e r easonable for entities to participate in knowledge ma na gement proposals and mor e effortless for workers to take part in them. As far as social capital furthers organizational knowledge management, entities should consider it as a useful resource, and deliberately capitalize on it. …",

      "abstract": "Los sistemas educativos contemporaneos procuran atender diversas demandas que surgen de la sociedad en su conjunto. Por una parte la inclusion de los sujetos en la vida social por medio del ejercicio de la ciudadania, por otro la insercion en un ‘mercado’ laboral-profesional. Se hace referencia a la ‘sociedad del conocimiento’ y al ‘pensamiento complejo’. A situaciones enmarcadas por la movilidad humana y el impacto de las comunicaciones que desdibujan fronteras e instalan un pluralismo cultural generalizado. Al estimulo al consumo y la concentracion demografica en grandes urbes. Estas y otras razones son advertidas como obstaculos frente a los procesos de significacion existencial y al estimulo del desarrollo de proyectos vitales, desde donde las personas puedan asumir un rol critico y responsable. En un escenario donde intervienen tantas variables, es necesario continuar llevando la pregunta filosofica hasta uno de los nucleos centrales: que puede proveer el proceso formativo a cada persona particular y a esta para vivir junto con otras. Cuando una persona toma conciencia de la complejidad del propio proceso de comprension, puede disponerse de un modo diverso frente a sus propios procesos de aprendizaje y, en especial, frente a sus propias practicas y a su actuacion junto con otras personas. Por ello se conjetura la necesidad de considerar como parte de la formacion superior, el tratamiento de ciertas ‘Competencias semanticas’ que ayuden a cada persona a integrar sus saberes y experiencias, en procesos orientados hacia la significatividad y el sentido. A partir de alli, podra posicionarse frente al conocimiento disciplinar, frente a las situaciones problematicas reales por resolver, frente a los colegas y tambien en toda circunstancia que le involucre, advertido, por un lado, de los limites de todo ‘objetivismo’ radical y, por otro, hallandose preparado para interpretar las situaciones en contexto. La presente investigacion considera los aportes que la Hermeneutica filosofica puede brindar a la educacion superior. El problema de la ‘comprension’ y el de la ‘significacion’ o significatividad, son cuestiones centrales para la Pedagogia, temas habitualmente abordados desde la psicologia cognitiva. Sin embargo aqui, inquiriendo la obra de H-G. Gadamer y P. Ricoeur, se indaga acerca del alcance ontologico del problema de la comprension como algo determinante en la constitucion del ser humano. Tambien se advierte que la dimension linguistica es la que posibilita a las personas dotar de significatividad a aquello que es objeto de comprension. El problema es complejo pero al mismo tiempo es relevante como parte constitutiva del proceso de aprendizaje en cada persona.",

      "abstract": "The fifth and last part of this study compares the obtained result with normative principles that have been or can be proposed in the framework of economics. These principles are either aspects or cases of the obtained result (e.g., market liberalism, self-ownership, income egalitarianisms, social maximand functions), complements to it (for applications in the fields of microjustice or \"mesojustice\"), or, possibly, alternative proposals. Hence, the scope of the considered ideas is extensive. The focus here, however, is on their meaning, rather than on technicalities whose relevance fully depends on this meaning in the first place. The resulting survey of meanings of normative economic ideas, principles, or criteria probably has an interest in itself. There is, for instance, a close consideration of the various aspects of freedom (social, defined by a priori domains of choice, \"natural\" as socially unruly, or as various concepts and types of opportunity, rights, desert or merit from action, or responsibility); of the various meanings, uses, and properties of the concept of \"utility\" (happiness, satisfaction, lower pain, preference, choice, transitivity, comparabilities of various types); and of the rationally necessary structures of distributive principles (permutability, prima facie or ideal equality, lower inequality, benevolence), with their scope of application. Indeed, each principle or criterion should be accompanied by a clear and justified statement of the assumed meaning of the concepts it uses and of their properties, and of the proposed scope of application.",

Here we study theoretically the evolutionary origins of the capacity to internalize norms. In our models, individuals can choose to participate in collective actions as well as punish free riders. In making their decisions, individuals attempt to maximize a utility function in which normative values are initially irrelevant but play an increasingly important role if the ability to internalize norms emerges. Using agent-based simulations, we show that norm internalization evolves under a wide range of conditions so that cooperation becomes \"instinctive.\" Norm internalization evolves much more easily and has much larger effects on behavior if groups promote peer punishment of free riders. Promoting only participation in collective actions is not effective. Typically, intermediate levels of norm internalization are most frequent but there are also cases with relatively small frequencies of \"oversocialized\" individuals willing to make extreme sacrifices for their groups no matter material costs, as well as \"undersocialized\" individuals completely immune to social norms. Evolving the ability to internalize norms was likely a crucial step on the path to large-scale human cooperation.",

      "abstract": "Conditionality, among other aspects, determines that the regulatory development of the countries that make up the European Union can be carried out, as is usual in the social sphere, without the intervention, or at least minimally, of the workers’ representatives and entrepreneurs, and also from other political formations in the legislative field. Logically, this absence of social or political participation can promote response actions against them, either traditional (strikes, demonstrations, withdrawal of parliamentary support in adoption of legislative measures etc.), or new types (spontaneous concentrations in public places, general assemblies of citizens without a defined convener, appearance of social and political formations of less visible typology, or other similar ones). The financial crisis unleashed at the end of 2007 and the one derived from the health emergency situation due to the global spread of Covid-19, at the beginning of 2020, have precisely encouraged the use of conditionality in the European Union space. However, the way in which conditionality has been developed in one and another crisis in the Spanish State can be said that it has not been identical. Neither have been the reactions of social and political subjects, because if in the first crisis these subjects have experienced a reduction in their functions of participation or intervention in legislative action and in the proposal of political actions, in the second the possibilities of action have been much more significant, and also their contribution to efforts to overcome the crisis situation.",

(cited in Giroux and McLaren 1997: 150) What unifies Bloch and Freire in their difficult challenge of transforming schools into more democratic spaces is their active refusal to link hope to a past eschatological event or to a finite historical moment. Hope for changes, improvements, solidarity, and social justice is the guiding force, a force that is grasped a pulsating latency of possibility contained in the unity of the immanent and transcendent. As such, hope is to be conscripted by social agents in order to contest the gangsterism of the spirit so common in this era of consumer capitalism, and to fill the empty space of postmodern nihilism (Giroux and McLaren 1997: 157). We understand utopias, after Freire and Bloch, as providing the conceptual horizon for the development of democratic schooling.

      "abstract": "Each individual represents a complex network of social relationships, starting with primary socialization by parents or caretakers (Duff, 2010; Ochs & Schieffelin, 2008). As we grow up, we get socialized into more and more social groups, including families, friendships, sports teams, religious organizations, or professional associations. These relationships shape our identity throughout our lives. Some aspects of our identity are determined for us; others we control. Some aspects are relatively constant, since societies and social groups strive for stability (i.e., preferring little or slow change); others are malleable. We present our selves in different ways across various interactional contexts (e.g., professional identity at work, familial at home). Studying another language provides a unique opportunity to reflect on our various selves, because our identities are often renegotiated when we encounter new cultures and navigate new social expectations. To delve into these issues, this chapter examines identity as a complex and dynamic phenomenon, considers the relationship between language and identity, and suggests ways for addressing these issues in the L2 classroom.",

      "title": "Unbundling Workplace Conflict: Developing A Theory Of Conflict Mobilization",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research on a wide variety of conflict forms at work such as absenteeism, sabotage, turnover, grievances, job actions and strikes, relatively little is known about the complexities of their inter-relationships. This is partly because most studies of workplace conflict have dealt with only one form at a time and the focus has often been on the more intense expressions. The Industrial Relations and Organizational Behavior literatures are synthesized to build a new framework that regards workplace conflict not as a single, isolated event but a process in which individual and unorganized expressions of conflict develop into full-blown collective actions. The choice of conflict expressions is a function of the state of worker mobilization. Softer job actions are unlikely without some prior experience with such individual expressions as grievances, health and safety complaints and absenteeism. Vigorous collective actions are unlikely without some prior experience with such softer forms of collective actions as job actions (slow- downs, work-to-rule actions, overtime bans, informal picketing, etc.). Using data from the Workplace and Employee Survey (WES) conducted by Statistics Canada, we found evidence of the institutionalization of workplace conflict in unionized workplaces, where the basic conflict of interest is regulated and mobilized by unions in a top-down fashion. In contrast, as for non-union workplaces, we found that grievances evolve from individual forms of expression to collective forms in a bottom-up fashion but only where the grievance procedure ends at management and is not neutral. Thus our findings provide significant theoretical insights into conflict dynamics that have practical implications for dispute resolution.",

      "title": "Intergroup Relations: Its Linguistic and Communicative Parameters",
      "abstract": "IT IS not difficult to argue that language and communication processes are a core element of the social psychology of intergroup relations (Clement, 1996; Giles & Reid, 2004; Gudykunst, 1986; Lambert, 1967); indeed, they are integral constituents of our group identities (Cargile, Giles, & Clement, 1996) and what differentiates us from other relevant outgroups. However, such a case has not always been easy to make, although it is clearly evident in a plethora of aspects of our communicative lives, including dress styles, cosmetics, marches, vigils, festivals, websites, music, etc. Language and communication received their first sustained attention in the group dynamics tradition, particularly with reference to the development of social comparison and dissonance theories (Festinger, 1954). Nevertheless, much of this early work conceptualized language as nothing more than a vehicle for (intra)group and psychological processes, notably decision making and leadership (e.g. Bales, 1956). The social context of group behavior was all but absent, and language was treated very much as a functional property of group life. However, this began to change in the 1970s when Giles (1977, 1978) invoked social identity theory to explain the sociolinguistic phenomenon of language shifts. This work led, in part, to an elaboration of speechand later communication-accommodation theory (e.g. Gallois, Ogay, & Giles, 2004; Giles & Coupland, 1991), parallel developments of ethnolinguistic identity theory (Giles & Johnson, 1981, 1987), anxiety/uncertainty reduction theory (Gudykunst, 1995), and many others (e.g. Barker, Giles, & Harwood, 2004). Core research foci include language attitudes (Bradac, Cargile, & Hallett, 2001), multilingualism (Sachdev & Bourhis, 2005), aging (Williams & Nussbaum, 2001), health (Harwood & Sparks, 2003), inter-ability communication (Fox & Giles, 1997), gender (Reid, Keerie, & Palomares, 2003; Smith, 1985), intercultural relations (Hecht, Jackson, & Pitts, 2005), terrorism (Sparks, in press), and so on and so forth. Meanwhile, more phenomena and areas of investigation are recognizing the intergroup dimension: small group processes (Hogg & Tindale, 2005), organizational processes (Gardner, Paulsen, Gallois, Callan, & Monaghan, G P I R",

      "abstract": "The demonstrated urgency of the climate crisis would require mobilization by a larger and more diverse set of participants than those usually recognized as environmental activists. Hence this article asks: (1) What conditions enable unlikely participants (such as men working in manual occupations) to engage in and identify with a climate movement? And (2) what is it about the relationship between participants’ biographies, the practices of the climate movement and the interaction between them that allows – or affords – such identification to occur? I draw on an approach to identity formation as situated practice, i.e., as occurring in situations where social relations are enacted while drawing on the individual experience and shared understandings that participants bring to the situation. Based on fieldwork in Finnish municipalities that have committed to climate neutrality, I find that the conditions for engagement depend on socio-cultural affordances for engaging in climate action, which (1) accept and welcome participants’ life histories and lifestyles (2) build on and respect participants’ competences and multiple forms of expertise, (3) engage participants in practices that are familiar enough not to produce anxiety but stimulating enough to be fun, and (4) produce small but visible achievements that are acknowledged as such by both participants and onlookers. The current study contributes to previous research arguing for a more populist approach to climate policy by emphasizing existing competences and embodied practices as an avenue for engagement in climate action.",

Yet, the difficulty is that nature and society are both laden with uncertainties – so, from the outset, answers are not clear to questions such as how to create knowledge and how to create social institutions. Fixed institutions and fixed values may seem to work well for a while, but will, eventually fail to do so. At that point, the dynamics of nature and society need to be recognized, requiring changing to a method that places importance on a process that is constantly on the move. The following five points are the keys to handling such a process: (1) recognize plural values, (2) avoid setting a single goal (prepare multiple goals and multiple institutions), (3) aim for a multifaceted dynamic consensus building (not one where the stakeholders are merely brought together to confirm the unification of opinion), (4) learn collaboratively, and (5) achieve interactive support in an adaptive manner.",

The most profound long term consequences of the increasingly widespread use of psychedelics may not be medical or even psychological in nature, but rather socio-logical. Altered states of consciousness create nothing less than new perceptual configurations which may well spell the end of social institutions based upon modes of perception which are incongruent with new perceptions being attained by increasing numbers of people via the psychedelic experience.",

Such change can occur gradually or abruptly and not always as part of people's conscious experience. In such situations, features of the broader ecological contexts in which people live moderate the process of coping. Successfully coping affects well‐being and other psychosocial outcomes and in most, but not all instances, requires active engagement, development of a sense of control and capitalizing on proximate social and personal resources. Future research should emphasize cross‐national study of objective and subjective outcomes, and the relationships between demands (broadly defined), varieties of mechanisms for coping, and the full range of personal and social resources available for doing so. The aim of such research must be to inform social policies designed to empower people's sense of personal agency and aligned with relevant changes in opportunity structures.",

Sin embargo, cuando las administraciones publicas definen y desarrollan politicas a favor de la cohesion social, estas son orientadas a la mejora y garantia del acceso de los ciudadanos a servicios basicos (educacion, salud, etc.), a sus posibilidades economicas a traves del empleo y a su nivel de integracion y vinculacion social.

      "title": "Public diplomacy and Australian practice",
      "abstract": "The conduct of traditional diplomacy involves communication, negotiation, compromise and persuasion, and mainly occurs in private, or even in secrecy. In contrast, public diplomacy necessarily occurs in the public sphere. If practitioners of public diplomacy are understood to 'conduct foreign policy by engaging with a foreign public' (Cull 2012), they have many means at their disposal, such as mounting international expositions, branding campaigns, or the promotion of a nation's language and culture abroad. Because the use of social media is an important asset in public diplomacy, it sometimes tends to be mistaken for public diplomacy itself, obscuring the fact that the fundamental tools of both traditional and public diplomacy, and their national purposes, overlap and are often the same.Public diplomacy might be expected to be among Australia's highest foreign affairs priorities. Located in a region where English is not a majority language and where many of Australia's neighbours know little about its culture, Australia has both a particular challenge and a special opportunity to make a positive impression. But an 'image problem' has affected Australia's reputation among its neighbours (Evans and Grant 1991: 70). Compounded by the racial exclusion policies of the past, their recrudescence in the current offshore detention of refugees and asylum seekers, and Australia's perennial lack of independence in foreign and defence policy, it sets a high bar for those seeking to create effective public diplomacy. Yet far from redoubling its efforts, Australia does not even match comparable countries with which it competes for influence in the region.Australian public diplomacy - which was for long called 'cultural relations' - still resides in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), where it has several times been moved from one part of the organisational structure to another, and even to other buildings. The resources devoted to it, the means of its delivery, and even the understanding of what public diplomacy is, have always been limited (Senate 2007; Byrne 2010; Broinowski 2012). In creating a Public Diplomacy division in 2014, DFAT reflected not just the change in linguistic fashion but the ways in which nations now seek to influence each other. 'Public diplomacy' and its siblings - cultural, citizen, sports, grassroots diplomacy, and so on - can be seen as the cousins of Joseph Nye's 'soft power' (Nye 2004: 5). In these new forms of diplomacy, practitioners seek to be more inclusive and populist than their traditional predecessors, and make more use of social media (Cull 2012). They include actors who are not professional diplomats.In response to new government priorities, technological change, international trends, and fashions in popular culture, public diplomacy has recently undergone further transformation. However, most Australians, are unaware of these developments since, paradoxically, Australian public diplomacy is rarely discussed outside government. Here I will first consider Australia's record in public diplomacy and then examine as a specific example our recent performance at the United Nations under both Labor (2007-13) and Coalition governments (2013-16), and our candidacy for future seats.Australia's Record in Public DiplomacyCoalition Foreign Ministers Richard Casey (1951-60) and Paul Hasluck (1964-69) were notable for taking an active interest in cultural relations. Casey, from his experience as Governor of Bengal, understood the importance of the press and radio in projecting Australia into Asian countries (Casey 1954), and Hasluck had been a journalist and war historian. But Australia had no equivalent of the British Council or other countries' similar institutions. In 1967, under Hasluck, a national overseas cultural policy was drafted and an offshore organisation was planned with dedicated staff and an initial budget of £12,500, but in 1969 it was killed off by an inter-departmental committee (Manton 2003: 37-8). …",

Then, it will be shown that responsibility for the consequences of a particular common action will be distributed over the partaking members according to the role they played in the respective practice. Unfortunately, this distribution of responsibility cannot be used as a model of how a group is or should be developing decisions. Single individuals come up with decisions according to a mixed bag of internal and external motivators that may even change while the individual is carrying out the respective action. On this basis, it will finally be shown why certain groups that are differently organized in paradigmatic fashions (e.g. in strictly hierarchical, somehow democratic and totally anarchistic ways) may develop different and sometimes unpredictable decisions.",

      "title": "Businesses and Racial Equity: Taking a Stand and Committing to Action",
      "abstract": "Whether or not to take a public stance on political or social issues or on events such as those that played out following the death of George Floyd is often a difficult decision for companies, many of whom are concerned about alienating certain groups of customers by associating their brands with “controversial” positions on sensitive issues that are dividing society. However, pressure from employees, consumers and investors had already been building in the years prior to Floyd’s death for business leaders to explain where they stand and how their values are being incorporated into the decisions that they are making about products, messaging, the way in which their workers being treated and community relationships. Speaking out is essential and the company needs to provide all its stakeholders with a clear public statement of its values and overriding commitment to racial equality in society and diversity, equity and inclusion in its own operations and relationships with stakeholders. While there is a risk of losing those who may not agree with the positions that leaders take on behalf of themselves and the company, there is a moral imperative to taking a stand and evidence to support the expectation that the overall health of the business will improve over the long-term because of building a stronger connection with employees and customers. It is important to consider the process of “taking a stand”, since the words will be closely scrutinized and serve as foundational guidance for all the actions that follow. However, words alone are not enough, and leaders of the business will also need to settle on the specific actions that the company will be taking to contribute to the cause. Planning for action begins with the internal and external engagement processes used to craft the company’s public position on the specific issue or event, such as racial justice reforms, and then extends to identifying the problems that are most material to its own situation and generate ideas on how the company might be able to contribute its resources to addressing the relevant issues. The next step is the development of commitments accompanied by action plans that include specific strategies, tactics, and metrics, as well as the intention to be transparent to stakeholders and report on the progress made by the company on fulfilling its commitments and the impact of its actions. While each company is different, commitments should generally address embedding diversity and inclusion; financial equity and security; diversity and inclusion in the workforce and in the boardroom and C-suite; community investment and engagement; and products and services.",

Ella persigue que los actores sociales, en lugar de mantener actitudes de confrontacion, logren ciertas areas de consenso que suponen obtener, a mediano y a largo plazo, resultados ventajosos para ambas partes y para la sociedad en general. Es una practica negociable cuyo objeto abarca aspectos politicos, economicos, juridicos, sociales, fiscales, laborales, etc.; que la hacen una figura totalmente distinta de otras similares como la cooperacion tripartita, dialogo social, negociacion colectiva, pactos sociales, neocontractualismo, etc. El gran requisito de la concertacion social es la existencia de ciertas circunstancias especiales que induzcan a las partes sociales, amenazadas por dificultades que son comunes a ambas, a llegar a un acuerdo que les permita, por encima de sus intereses especificos y contradictorios, adoptar conductas de consenso destinadas a superar tales dificultades, optando por un nuevo sistema donde impere el libre juego de sus fuerzas antagonicas. Es notorio que en los paises donde la concertacion, social ha obtenido logros mas destacados, esta se ha apoyado en un entendimiento basico entre importantes sectores de la politica de cada pais. En America Latina existe un vacio, pues la carencia de conocimientos suficientes sobre la situacion economica y social de la region, de las dificultades presentes y previsibles y de las formulas posibles para superarlas, constituyen un obstaculo para que las partes sociales se comprometan realmente en un proceso eficiente de concertacion.",

      "title": "Tejiendo la voz. Arte para la transformación social",
      "abstract": "Es una gran alegria compartir la metodologia de este trabajo “Tejiendo la voz. Arte para la transformacion social”. La idea de esta investigacion surgio desde varias inquietudes. Una de ellas fue como encontrar codigos de comunicacion en contextos tan complejos como los de Guatemala, donde hay “multiples Guatemalas”, realidades muy distintas marcadas por diversidad cultural, pero tambien por grandes brechas en cuanto a la desigualdad social, las posibilidades de acceso a seguridad, educacion, etc. Partiendo de la idea de que el codigo es un sistema de significados compartidos, seria muy ingenuo pensar que el idioma lo es, ya que una misma palabra puede tener una connotacion muy distinta, segun el contexto cultural y social. Por ejemplo, una cosa es hablar de paz en un sector residencial de Guatemala y una muy diferente en las zonas de mayor riesgo, o en las regiones rurales donde la pobreza se manifiesta de forma muy aguda. Asimismo, en colectivos de culturas diversas. Del desafio de encontrar cual seria una plataforma que nos permitiera ir mas alla de la confrontacion y la elaboracion mental, de esa necesidad humana de poseer la razon y persuadir al otro, que decidi apostar por el cuerpo y la corporeidad como codigo de comunicacion y la experiencia artistica como una plataforma para la convivencia y el dialogo. Otra inquietud fue preguntarme que es lo que valoramos y validamos como conocimiento, si solo es posible conocer desde la mente y desde la racionalidad o si hay otras posibilidades humanas para construirlo. Una interpelacion importante fue el concepto del “Winaq”, concepto que desde el pensamiento maya concibe la integralidad, la unidad tanto del ser humano en todas sus areas, como de la interrelacion humana con todo lo que existe. Desde esta base, el conocimiento no solamente se genera desde lo mental, pues esto nos limitaria solo a una de las posibilidades y como dije antes, el ser humano es integral. Por tanto, desde la parte afectiva, existe una forma de conocer; desde el sentir, lo espiritual, lo emocional. Me refiero al sentir no como un sentimentalismo romantico, sino todo lo contrario; como ir a lo profundo de las realidades con todo el ser, sumergiendo el cuerpo, los sentidos, dejando que ellos hablen. Alli es donde la experiencia artistica juega un papel muy importante, porque al viajar en un proceso creativo, conectamos justamente con nuestra integralidad humana y construimos formas distintas de relacionarnos con la o  el otro, caminos para un conocimiento mas genuino desde lo que nos hace humanos, humanas. Elegi trabajar con cuatro areas artisticas: danza, teatro, musica y poesia, cada una tiene su por que. La danza es una manera de construir caminos entre los puntos importantes que unen a una sociedad; identificando esos puntos, necesitamos crear movimiento para unirlos y tejer redes que permitan convivir y fortalecernos. El sentido de esta danza es que surja de los movimientos que hacemos todos los dias, esos movimientos que tenemos arraigados en el cuerpo y que nos dicen quienes somos. Apuesto por el teatro como una via para encuentros verdaderos, como un camino para encarnar al otro y no solo actuarle, es decir, ponerse en sus zapatos, tratar de entrar en su cuerpo, en su ser para conocerle y esto en multiples vias. Al hacer una historia de un personaje que nace de nuestras realidades, estamos transformando corporeidades y expresando lo que nace de nuestros propios seres, de nuestros cuerpos, que son territorios en permanente movimiento, que se encuentran, tienen conflictos, crecen y se transforman. La musica entendida como un lenguaje que trasciende las palabras y se adentra en otras esferas humanas, fue abordada tambien desde el cuerpo. Tomamos el latido del corazon como ritmo basico y comun a todos y todas. La musica no solo traduce realidades, sino que es en si misma una forma de practica social. La poesia se trabajo como un camino para unir textos, entendidos como experiencias de vida, hechos historicos, reacciones ante el entorno, resistencias, negociaciones, adaptaciones. Como un puente entre las herencias de generaciones anteriores y los nuevos pensamientos y sentires. Estas  cuatro  ramas artisticas  fueron  trabajadas como una plataforma de convivencia en dos fases: una intracomunicacion para luego pasar a una segunda de encuentro con los otros. No fue el interes del proyecto trabajar con artistas, sino facilitar herramientas artisticas para jovenes, en territorios donde no existen espacios de expresion para este sector de la poblacion.",

The purpose of associating language with goals like these is to motivate policy and planning for language education at the national, state, or local level, or within the federal language education system. In an ideal world, every policy and intervention at the societal level would be discussed, based on an explicit cost-benefit analysis of the contribution of the intervention to the societal good. This would presume a clear specification of the contribution of the specific intervention domain (e.g., language) to the societal goal (e.g., national security), together with the qualifications of the responsible implementing agent (e.g., the Department of Defense and/or the higher education system). Such specification entails an economic approach, which involves specific description of the elements involved and the correlation of cost and benefit.",

Consideration of such a broadly inclusive category is well beyond the scope of this entry. But there is a far narrower subset of human action to which the term has been applied. In this entry, “collective action” refers to emergent and minimally coordinated action by two or more people that is motivated by a desire to change some aspect of social life or to resist changes proposed by others . “Emergent” signifies innovative lines of action that depart from taken‐for‐granted normative routines. “Coordinated” means that the various parties to the emerging conflict are attuned to one another and act in awareness of this fact. Finally, the emphasis on change and/or resistance to change is designed to capture the adversarial or potentially conflictual nature of “collective action.”",

      "title": "Using Networks and Networking",
      "abstract": "Abstract Clients with multiple problems and needs are increasing. An abusive mother may require income assistance, job training, day care, psychosocial therapy, parenting education and skills, and other social supports to change her behavior. If the father is present, family therapy may be needed. If not, she may need assistance in obtaining absent parent financial and social supports. Rarely are all needed services available from a single agency; usually they must be obtained from many autonomous organizations. The social worker and the client will need to construct and manage a service network. Whittaker, Garbarino, and associates (1983) and others (Payne, 2000; Travillion, 1999) hold that assessing, developing, and managing social networks and assisting clients in their assessment, development, and management of social networks is the crux of social work practice. Client needs generally do not coincide with a single agency’s service packets. The sheer number of agencies with varying service arrangements and regulations and a client’s informal social supports generates management complexity for the individual client and social worker and demands commensurate network management skills. Networks are equally important to macro community practice, which largely consists of building and managing social networks. Social workers network when they refer clients to other agencies, help clients develop social supports, and work with social action coalitions.",

      "abstract": "Communities have rich networks of social relationships if and when they are flourishing economically and politically. In hard times, however, the various groupings within a community may splinter and fragment, resulting in little communication, and few relationships. Television has undoubtedly contributed to this breakdown in many communities, but so too do declines in the economy, divisive political or social issues, and natural or man made disasters. In such difficult situations, many individuals are stressed, and as a result, it may be possible for social change agents to intervene, and set up new ways to establish and develop meaningful relationships for significant numbers of participants. Particularly for those who are severely stressed, options to change are often sought. The use of diverse discussion groups as one means offers a community wide method of enhancing human relationships to enable members to better understand and cope with or manage problematic issues. Practitioners from several disciplines may use ecological principles to approach communities and intervene through use of “diverse discussion groups.”",

      "abstract": "Abstract Today the world faces many social challenges in the economic, social and environmental spheres that needs to be overcome. The public debate has been focused on finding solutions to them and one of these has been addressed as social entrepreneurship. This phenomenon combines the resourcefulness of traditional entrepreneurship with a mission to change society. Observing the positive social impact of entrepreneurs providing basic needs, this paper recognizes their unique role in efficiently contributing to the achievement of sustainable development goals. The purpose of this article is to introduce the connection of social innovations and sustainable growth as an important phenomenon in today's real economy. Based on the interviews with the focus group and the cases of good practice, the authors have established the development of social innovation and social entrepreneurship in Slovenia. It is important in numerous fields, especially in employment, social inclusion, demographic changes, health care, education, finance, political structures and social integration. We found that the obstacle in the development of social entrepreneurship is scattered, unrelated or absent support mechanisms that do not offer the right incentives for the creation and the development of social enterprises. Another conclusion is that cooperation with partners from different sectors of the society is an important fundament in their work with social entrepreneurship.",

The inherent problem is that these differentiated structures may become segmented into tightly closed systems, being in effect organizations within organization characterized by self-serving vested interests. Expediency becomes the operating rule. Segmentation is common to all societies, but it is especially prevalent in situations of decline. Advanced in this discussion is that the segmentation process may be accelerated and consolidated by in-house training and education, and especially by those of a public management character. A plea is made for universities to become more actively engaged in (a) the preparation and placement of “quality” educated persons and (b) the search/development of new public organization.",

      "title": "Clinical Sociology and the Individual Client",
      "abstract": "Clinical sociology has a large, albeit under-appreciated, role to play in helping individual clients. The types of problems addressed by helping professionals can be classified in four major areas, namely physiological problems, moral problems, problems in living, and role problems. These are respectively best dealt with by medical, social control, problemsolving, and resocialization solutions. Clinical sociology can contribute to each of these owing to its expertise in social support, socialization, resocialization, emotional competence, and moral competence. As we approach the new millennium, it is remarkable mat the potential which sociology possesses for aiding individual clients who are troubled by personal problems has yet to be fully realized (Straus 1985). While psychology, medicine, and social work are solidly established, clinical sociology languishes in a backwater peopled chiefly by the sociological cognoscenti. The public has learned about the benefits of family therapy, art therapy, and even dance therapy, but the utility of a sociological perspective in addressing personal distress remains largely undiscovered. Given that much individual adversity can only be understood, or overcome, by recognizing its social dimensions, mis is an astonishing failure. In fact, clinical sociology speaks to a panoply of problem areas with a full quiver of unique interventions (Rebach and Bruhn 1991). For several decades now it has been expanding its domain of application, including areas ordinarily considered non-social. In this paper I will essay to outline the full",

      "abstract": "Emergence and Evolutions:Introducing Sign Language Sociolinguistics Annelies Kusters (bio) and Ceil Lucas (bio) sign languages, rural sign language, village sign language, sociolinguistics, variation, multimodal The very nature of sign languages in society is such that all of the areas of sociolinguistics are relevant to their study (Schembri and Lucas 2015; Roy and Metzger 2014). Sign languages range from national ones such as American Sign Language (ASL; Supalla and Clark 2014); or rural sign languages such Adamorobe Sign Language used in Ghana and in many other communities, where members of a community, both hearing and deaf, use a sign language (Nyst 2007; Zeshan and de Vos 2012); to alternate sign languages (Kendon 1989) such as Plains Indian Sign Language used by the hearing speakers of mutually unintelligible Native American languages and sometimes used also by deaf members of these communities (Davis 2015). Sign languages that have emerged in differing contexts have been used on different scales too: rural sign languages are used locally, in wider language ecologies that feature the ample use of gesture (Branson et al. 1999); national sign languages, which mostly emerged in deaf schools and deaf families are widely used throughout countries and beyond national borders (e.g., in contexts of migration); and some sign languages are used around the world in international contexts, most notably American Sign Language (ASL) and International [End Page 320] Sign (Parks 2014; Parks and Kusters forthcoming). The geographical spread of sign languages has developed largely independently from that of spoken languages, and researchers have identified sign language families (Padden 2011). Sign sociolinguists have documented the varied social contexts of these sign languages, which emerged respectively in mostly deaf contexts (e.g., Palfreyman 2019), in mixed deaf/hearing contexts (e.g., Marsaja 2008), and in mostly hearing contexts (e.g., Kendon 1989), and have proposed accounts on how these contexts of use shape the structures of sign languages (e.g., Schembri et al. 2018; Ellis et al. 2019). Naturally, the sensory asymmetries between deaf and hearing people, and related sensory access to languages impacts on sign languages, their use, and conceptualizations of them (De Meulder et al. 2019). This is one crucial difference between sign language sociolinguistics and spoken language sociolinguistics, which we expand on below. In a Dialogue section of the Journal of Sociolinguistics (vol. 26, no. 1), author pairs introduce a number of themes and debates in sign language sociolinguistics, explore why these are debates; how the debates are situated within sociolinguistics as a whole; and how spoken language sociolinguistics does or does not have similar debates. In order to give authors room to think beyond established subject areas (such as \"language contact\" or \"variationism\"), we chose five titles that foreground and represent debates rather than subject areas: Geographies and Circulations; Lumping and Splitting; Hierarchies and Constellations; Classifications and Typologies; Natural and Elicited. These main themes and debates in sign language sociolinguistics, as well as main parallels and differences with spoken language sociolinguistics, are introduced below. Themes in Sign Language Sociolinguistics Sign languages do not exist in sociolinguistic vacuums—sign languages are used in contexts where spoken/written languages, and increasingly also other sign languages are in use. An increasing number of signers are fluent in multiple spoken/written and/or signed languages. In short, multilingualism as concerns deaf and hearing sign language users is an extremely rich topic for investigation (Van Herreweghe and Vermeerbergen 2004; [End Page 321] Zeshan and Webster 2020). Multilingualism of course is closely linked to language contact, with all of the phenomena attested in spoken language contact and bilingualism also seen in sign language situations, along with some unique ones related to the multimodal nature of sign languages and the sensory asymmetries between deaf and hearing signers. Examples of signed and spoken/written language contact include fingerspelling (i.e., the manual representation of a writing system which has been assimilated into the phonology of many sign languages), the (partial) mouthing of spoken words, codeblending (also called sign-speaking or code-mixing), and chaining (e.g., signing a concept and then fingerspelling it); (e.g., Bagga-Gupta 2000; Holmström and Schönström 2018; Lucas and Valli 1992; Tapio 2019).

      "abstract": "“Welfare dependency” is a term applied (sometimes pejoratively) to the use of public benefits and services provided by the state. Such benefits and services have evolved in economically developed countries in recognition of the collective responsibilities owed to dependent members of society at points in the life course when they may not be able fully to depend on provision by families and/or the labor market. Critics of state benefits and social services may seek, on the one hand, to restrict or limit individual dependency through the application of means tests and/or behavioral conditions. Supporters, on the other hand, are concerned when citizens who need and have a right to receive state benefits or services fail to do so. There is evidence that state welfare systems can and do effectively smooth the ways in which contributions to and benefits from the state are made and received over the life course, but also that poorer and disadvantaged groups in society may systematically lose out, particularly in more socially and economically unequal societies.",

Can communication improve trust and outcomes between out-group members by making them more familiar? We construct a simple weak mechanism of group favoritism (different assigned colors) that induces in-group favoritism. Communication increases cooperation but does not affect per se the social identity gap, i.e., people make more favorable choices for in-group members. However, mutual promises are more effective for out-groups than in-groups, reducing or eliminating the social-identity gap. So perhaps, in some sense, out-group members are seen as more like in-group members when they have experienced mutual promises. We also find evidence that the two groups' decisions are driven by different motivations, one based on expectations in-groups and one based on moral commitment in the case of out-groups.

The profiles of leadership and innovation from these case studies highlight how ordinary people can make a difference by asking the right questions at the right time in the right manner, or in other words, by making their voices heard, often backed by the evidence, information and communication strategies. Although far from being comprehensive, these cases reveal some cross-cutting concepts and applications that act as key enablers for social accountability, such as: responsiveness and voice; power of information; local ownership; political buy-in; and local capacity building. However, certain areas of concern need to be kept in perspective when exploring possibilities for replicating, adapting, and scaling up these tools, namely: fragility of civil society space; urban focus; challenges of adaptation and contextualization; and weak regional networking.",

This chapter focuses primarily on the deployment of ‘social exclusion’ in the United Kingdom, in the context of EU policy, although many of the issues have wider application. The first part of the chapter addresses the development of definitions and indicators of social exclusion at UK national and at EU levels, showing that the distinctively social aspects of social exclusion have not been at the centre of these debates. The second part of the chapter outlines the findings of the Poverty and Social Exclusion (PSE) Survey itself, whose unique feature is its direct attention to exclusion from social relations and patterns of sociability. Two key points emerge. First, poverty has a profound effect on some, though not all, aspects of social participation. An objective relationship can be demonstrated here, casting doubt on the significance of the distinction between chosen and enforced non-participation. Second, although paid work is correlated with increased social participation on some measures, there is tentative evidence that this is principally an indirect effect mediated by poverty, and that paid work itself may in some cases limit social inclusion. ‘Economic inactivity’ does not, in itself, necessarily lead to exclusion from social relations. These findings cast doubt on the emphasis on work that is central to both European and UK policy.",

La falta de formacion especifica en las universidades en estos campos potencia este fenomeno que, debido a esto, no depende exclusivamente de la responsabilidad del periodista.

La inclusion es importante en si misma, pero tambien porque es el fundamento de la prosperidad compartida. La exclusion es siempre demasiado onerosa. Implica costes sociales, politicos y economicos.

Despite a large number of studies in the field, a clear ruling on describing data relations and the extent of the effects of the subsystems on each other does not exist. In the article the research models analysis of various aspects of the development of socio-environmental management systems has shown that such models cannot reflect a complete picture of the unfolding events in their processes; and solving environmental problems cannot be only in the context of environmental-economic relations. The study of regularities of sustainable development should rely on a more in-depth analysis of the causal relations between indicators and parameters of economic, environmental and social sub-systems, parts of the regional social, environmental and economic system. In modern conditions the development trends of regional social, environmental management systems do not leave issues confined to the field of economics, separate from the social and environmental spheres. To some extent, environmental and social priorities (contradictions or restrictions) are not restrictions essentially; they constitute additional criteria (or conditions) of transition to a new qualitative level of development (economic, technological, cultural, etc.) of human civilization. The regional level of sustainable development control plays a particular role, in particular, regional environmental management, the implementation of which is the essence of existence and functioning of regional socio-environmental management systems. The article provides an approach to the study of these relations when the interaction of socio-environmental management systems shows as relations and contradictions where management tasks, e.g. in economic subsystems, do not have socially and environmentally acceptable solutions (or do not need them). The differences between individual subsystems can and should be considered as a task, the solution of which will lead to a new high-quality step in social development. In the global perspective the main trend will be the interaction of these subsystems, so that the scope of the common interest will expand, and, with the time, merge completely.",

As the newcomers take up positions in the organisation, this presenting culture is modified to a certain degree, to take account of the existing cultural patterns in the organisation. However, these cultural patterns are not immutable, and are themselves changed by interaction with the new 'presenting cultures'.2 These two processes of change in the presenting culture and change in the organisational culture are continuing processes which accompany the development of both the individual and the organisation for a long time, but a significant portion of the changes takes place during the early periods of contact between the two.",

      "abstract": "Community work has been characterised by a marked anti-intellectualism in the past. Such an attitude is likely to diminish more out of an awareness of the needs of the field than from any sudden conversion to benefits obtainable from academic learning. Community workers' interest, on the hand, in macro analysis of social problems seems to derive from two sources. Primarily it is a response to a growth in awareness of how many of the issues and problems being tackled by community workers and community groups at local level are caused by forces, pressures and policies outside local areas. Community work and community workers can be passive recipients of forces which push and pull them in the spaces available, for example, between local groups and state bureaucracies. They can also be active participants in that process, with the capacity both to resist becoming incorporated by the people or employing organisations and to contribute knowledge and experience to them.",

      "title": "Social Agency and Grammar",
      "abstract": "Abstract One of the most conspicuous ways in which people distribute agency among each other is by asking another for help. Natural languages give people a range of forms to do this, the distinctions among which have consequences for how agency is distributed. Forms such as imperatives (e.g. “pass the salt”) and recurrent types of interrogatives (e.g. “can you pass the salt?”) designate another person as the doer of the action. In contrast to this, impersonal deontic statements (e.g. “it is necessary to get the salt”) express the need for an action without tying it to any particular individual. This can generate interactions in which the identity of the doer must be sorted out among participants, allowing us to observe the distribution of agency in vivo. The case of impersonal deontic statements demonstrates the importance of grammar as a resource for managing human action and sociality.",

      "title": "Association, reciprocity, sharing and dependency : conditions of access and forms of inequality beyond the market state",
      "abstract": "This thesis is essentially an inquiry into the bases of social inequality and the forms thatnunequal social relations take in contemporary Australian society. It addresses thesenissues from a somewhat different perspective from conventional sociological inquiry andnis concerned with devising a more comprehensive conceptual and empirical frameworknfor investigating social inequality. This inquiry is about relations of access; that is, formsnof attachment to means of consumption in various spheres of economic activity - thensocial relations that are formed for the purpose of obtaining goods and services fornsurvival and well-being.n n The thesis rests upon the argument that conventional sociological analyses of inequalitynthat have been focused upon the class bases (however defined) of inequality, whilstnrightly drawing attention to the structures that produce and perpetuate unequal access tonand control over income from the market (either wages or profits), have left us unable tonprovide adequate accounts of the economic status of whole categories of people whosensocial positions are primarily experienced and largely constructed outside the dominantnsphere of production in capitalist economies - those not in the labour force ornunemployed.n n An 'access relations' approach to inquiry is proposed. This takes as its starting point thenacknowledgement that firstly, inequalities in access to essential and valued resourcesnarise in a variety of different social settings, are constituted in and through different (andnmany) social divisions, and are sustained by a range of ideologies and discursivenpractices; and secondly, the structural and cultural forces that shape these different socialnsettings operate not simply at the societal or broader cultural levels but are enacted at thenlevel of lived experience, in households and residential contexts. The central question innthis inquiry is, 'What forms of household and residential organisation become centraln(hegemonic) in and across different social settings, and what exclusionary practices leadnto other forms being marginalised so that some categories of people come to have verynlimited access to or control over basic resources for survival and well-being?'n n The context of this inquiry is the Brisbane/lpswich/Moreton region of south-eastnQueensland in the 1990s. The sources of empirical evidence are, first, a secondarynanalysis of household survey data collected from some 372 households in the Brisbanenmetropolitan area in the early 1990s; and second, a follow-up study involving 28 in-depthninterviews with clients of emergency relief centres in the Ipswich/Moreton district thatnprovides a more detailed source of evidence of the conditions of consumption in highlynvulnerable households.n n Analysis of these data highlights the significance and inter-relatedness of labour marketnparticipation, gender divisions of labour, owner occupation of housing, patterns ofnfamily/household formation and change over the lifecourse, and maintenance of interhouseholdnnetworks as key processes that shape access to resources and, ultimately,nproduce enduring patterns of social inequality. Choice and control in accessnarrangements across all spheres of access emerge as fundamental characteristics ofnsecurity. Vulnerability, on the other hand, is seen to be connected to survival strategiesnpatterned around forms of dependency that may be inconsistent with, even contradictorynto, dominant forms of provisioning. Ultimately, the analysis focuses attention upon:n(i) the significance of kinship in the 'total economy' and of 'the family' as a site ofnexclusion; (ii) the fundamental importance of housing provision for survival; (iii) thenincreasingly central part that organisations of the Third Sector play in shaping accessnarrangements and strategies of survival at the periphery; and (iv) the significance ofnemergent identities of survival, for the inclusion/exclusion of vulnerable households atnthe periphery. By applying a range of strategies for inquiry, the analysis reveals thenmanner in which formations of class, gender and age relations operate upon, within andnacross a range of contexts in which people (including those whose main sources ofnincome are neither wages nor profits from the market) actively work to obtain goods andnservices for survival and well-being.n",

      "title": "Shame",
      "abstract": "Reliance on mutual aid is a distinctive characteristic of human biology. Consequently, a central adaptive problem for our ancestors was the potential or actual spread of reputationally damaging information about the self – information that would decrease the inclination of other group members to render assistance. The emotion of shame appears to be the solution engineered by natural selection to defend against this threat. The existing evidence suggests that shame is a neurocomputational program that orchestrates various elements of the cognitive architecture in the service of (i) deterring the individual from making choices wherein the personal benefits are exceeded by the prospective costs of being devalued by others, (ii) preventing negative information about the self from reaching others, and (iii) minimizing the adverse effects of social devaluation when it occurs. The flow of costs (e.g., punishment) and benefits (e.g., income, aid during times of hardship) in human societies is regulated to an important extent by this interlinked psychology of social evaluation and shame (as well as other social emotions). For example, the intensity of shame that laypeople express at the prospect of committing each of various offenses closely matches the intensity of the actual offense-specific punishments called for by criminal laws, including modern laws and ancient laws that are millennia old. Because shame, like pain, causes personal suffering and sometimes leads to hostile behavior, shame has been termed a “maladaptive” and “ugly” emotion. However, an evolutionary psychological analysis suggests that the shame system is elegantly designed to deter injurious choices and make the best of a bad situation.",

Main causes of this social isolation are associated with both inherent features of an individual and features of structures such as family and local community. An isolated person is a person who has limited number of significant others. Nevertheless, loneliness may also occur when a person is a part of a lot of social relations. The feeling of loneliness is therefore an individually experienced discomfort resulting from a subjective evaluation of the desired and the existing network of social relations. Both phenomena are threats to the welfare of individuals and at the same time are a challenge for organizations which are dealing with social policy. An analytical category which provides the diagnosis of loneliness and isolation is the social bond. The assessment of deficits associated with social bonds and can be performed measuring following criteria: quantity, quality and potency of the social bond.",

      "title": "Social Studies Curriculum",
      "abstract": "A social studies curriculum is an educational program about how people live together. Its aims are to prepare students for a democratic way of life which suggests learning to live with other people as well as critical thinking about controversial issues. The curriculum draws on a range of subjects that touch on social life, especially history, geography, and civics but also the social sciences: anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology. There is no one way to organize a social studies curriculum. In practice, however, certain approaches dominate although the history of the field features a number of major reform efforts to reconfigure it such as the new social studies projects of the 1960s and 1970s. A commitment to social studies aims rather than whether a program integrates different academic subjects or treats them separately distinguishes it from other approaches to social education (Thornton, 2005). The first social studies curricula appeared in the United States in the early twentieth century, however, in time comparable programs developed in other countries. Those programs in other countries may not necessarily be organized as they are in the United States nor always called \"social studies\" (Mehlinger & Tucker, 1979). Given its aims, social studies curriculum may provoke values disputes and the field has even, at times, directly embraced forms of values \"clarification\" (Duplass, 2018). Social studies curriculum policymakers, developers, and users cannot avoid questions of whose values are represented or endorsed or silenced. As curricular-instructional gatekeepers, classroom teachers are generally the key determinant of what values get taught (Thornton, 1991). In recent decades, \"accountability\" measures in the United States effectively shifted attention to other school subjects thus undermining the curricular status of social studies. During the same period, attention to geography within social studies appears to have declined. These two changes notwithstanding, a perennial feature of social studies curriculum seems to be a gap between the aims proclaimed for it and what actually unfolds in classrooms.",

      "abstract": "Los procesos de exclusión social se manifiestan en las grandes ciudades de casi todos los países, siendo así que en distintos espacios de una metrópoli existen, dos mundos o realidades, sin articularse y a veces sin verse, la plusvalía y la degradación urbana, los productores de riqueza y los marginados. Sin importar el amplio espectro de los estratos socioeconómicos actualmente se desarrollan y consolidan productos inmobiliarios cuyas cualidades físico-espaciales promueven desde su urbanización-construcción estructuras favorecedoras de la desintegración urbana, estructura fragmentada y segregación social. El espacio público, las relaciones sociales, se corrompen, marginan y negocian en la dinámica urbana, los efectos generalmente se asocian con aspectos diferenciales en el acceso y asimilación de recursos, infraestructura y servicios (entre más alto sea el nivel socioeconómico mayor accesibilidad a la diversidad y calidad en los mismos). Algunos autores refieren que la movilidad social ascendente sólo se produce por herencia o tras someterse a un mejoramiento en el nivel educativo. Conscientes o no, los usuarios de los fraccionamientos cerrados (vivienda unifamiliar del segmento medio) se agrupan o recluyen de acuerdo a características con las que el mismo mercado los homogeneizó. El fenómeno se analiza al considerar la elección de la localización residencial como origen para establecer patrones de arraigo, apego, exclusión e imaginarios urbanos resultantes de los trayectos de movilidad cotidiana dentro de la metrópoli. Las conclusiones obtenidas a nivel cualitativo y cuantitativo, se producen a partir de una reflexión teórica sobre el fenómeno y el segundo por medio de una caracterización geográfica resultado de encuestas y entrevistas a profundidad; que responden la cuestión sobre las determinantes en el patrón de localización residencial en el AMMty.",

      "title": "Social Integration – Levels and Dimensions",
      "abstract": "Abstract The conceptual proposals on social integration are diffuse and vague. Alarmist diagnoses are contrasted by empirical research results that give an all-clear signal. For an adequate understanding of social integration processes, basic theoretical questions must first be clarified. The specific unit “society” as the point of reference for what is to be integrated is replaced by a constitutional perspective that takes a look at different levels of societization ( Vergesellschaftung [Max Weber’s term “ Vergesellschaftung ” is not easy to translate. I follow Bruun and Whimster’s (in Weber 2012, p. 496) proposal: “societization”.]) and their relationship with one another (social categories, milieus, intermediary organizations, state order, and the global level). Social integration is not identical to a stable and well-organized order. It has value references that set standards for successful integration. However, the extent of cultural integration is no less fraught with conflict than that of social integration. Actors in a certain structural situation resort to such legitimizing values and are thereby confronted with value dilemmas. Sociology is not able to offer ideal states as expressed in conceptual promises of “solidarity” or “cohesion.” Rather, it has a rich knowledge of constellations with different levels of societization in the context of different value relations. This is of central importance for an understanding of the complex processes of integration and disintegration and the role of the social sciences in public discourses on problems of integration.",

Two of the main reasons are a lack of respect for children and the failure to recognise the value of the specific emotional and affective language of the child, which, indeed, is often reduced to the predominating adult standard, namely the language of production, of the market place, of a lack of imagination, a language whose gratuitousness reflects the fact that our induced needs are mass-produced. Roccato (1998) speaks of emotional illiteracy and of an inadequate perception of the self in many patients today who require psychoanalytical treatment. Joyce McDougall (1982) introduced the term alexithymia into psychoanalysis. Paedophilia can count on the complicity and support which is implicit in the entire social body: we are referring not only and not principally to elitist ideological sympathies, but rather to widespread attitudes of emotive identification with paedophilia, which are more implicit and immediate.",

      "abstract": "[1] Co-Chair of the panel: Andrea De Vincenti and Andreas Hoffmann-Ocon (Zurich University of Teacher Education) [3] Panel: Body at Risk II: creating the social collective through education Religious, cultural, or social struggles and political and economic crises during the 19 th and 20 th century led to widespread and manifold fears and notions of the social body at risk. As the case may be, the social body was said to deteriorate and to fall apart (Pross 2013). Furthermore confidence in the actual society lacked in various historical contexts so that future and better societies were imagined and planned in various ways. The blueprint was formed according to the diagnosed risk that allegedly corroded the actual social body and focused for instance on homogeneity, justice or efficiency. As a possible solution to the perceived fragmentation of society, social engineers or experts were supposed to reconnect the social body by bringing in scientific knowledge (Etzemuller 2009). However, not only experts but also educational institutions and organisations should lead to a better society by educating the individual (Tanner 2012, Blom 2008). Scientific, moral and habitual knowledge transmitted by schools or educational colleges should heal or save the body at risk. Referring mainly to the body as Metaphor (subtheme 8), this panel explores how the social body in different historical contexts was imagined and how education should help to achieve it. Thus, on the one hand it asks who or what was included in or excluded from the “organic whole” (Poovey 1995, 8) of the imagined social collective. On the other hand, it focuses on education as the means by whom the envisaged social body should be formed. Furthermore, it outlines the various educational concepts, measures and interventions that were supposed to heal or save the body at risk. [bibliography] Blom, Philipp, Der taumelnde Kontinent.

Concepts of the Social Body in Swiss Teacher Education in the first Half of the Twentiest Century (Andreas Hoffmann-Ocon and Andrea De Vincenti, Zurich University of Teacher Education; a.hoffmann-ocon@phzh.ch; andrea.devincenti@phzh.ch) The school was conceived of as a social place to make better humans in order to build a better society. Accordingly, educational concepts and interventions were ascribed the power to create the allegedly vulnerable or even lost social cohesion. Especially schools and colleges of teacher education were supposed to form individuals that understood themselves as a part of the social body and were willing to contribute to economic, social and political well-being of the whole social collective. These utopian social collectives historically have been used by various exponents and from very different ideological perspectives to fight eg. for or against democracy, freedom, equality, modernity, alienation or the existing society (Spitta 2013, S. 12). This paper examines writings by teacher educators in the first half of the 20 th century that imagined a social body torn together by educational intervention (Wyss 1922, 5). In order to legitimate their position, they often referred to an allegedly vulnerable or even lost social cohesion and conveyed the need for educational interventions such as the “social education” (Wyss 1928) on the individual that must be trained to see himself as part of a collective and overcome differences in socialisation in heterogeneous milieus (Guyer 1934, 19). Teacher educators referred for instance to the concept of auturgy in the context of the “Arbeitsschulbewegung” but also to American pedagogy and psychology.

Body politics and the formation of “empirische Bildungsforschung“ (empirical education research) in Western Germany, 1954-1964 (Britta Behm, Research Library for the History of Education (BBF, Berlin)/ Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin (HU); bbehm@posteo.de) To this day, Georg Picht’s diagnose of a major crisis of German education in 1964 (he stated a „deutsche Bildungskatastrophe“) is seen as a beacon for the subsequent massive reforms in the education sector. Using several statistics in his analysis he linked the state of emergency in education with the prediction of economic decline („Bildungsnotstand heist wirtschaftlicher Notstand“). In the course of his argument the pupil’s body subtly became a cipher of potential achievement and efficiency (der Abiturient als „Kapital“ und „geistige[s] Potential“). Just ten years earlier, this kind of linking educational items to economic categories seemed not only to be marginal but more or less banned far beyond the educational discourse. At that time, e.g. Hellmut Becker, a close friend of Pichts and since 1963 director of the newly founded Max Planck-Institute for Human Development in Berlin, which should bring forward the so called “empirische Bildungsforschung” (empirical education research), had interpreted the perceived crisis of the school system as a result of a bureaucratic world („verwaltete Welt“) and had propagated the educational goal of the ‘free human’ („freie[r] Mensch“) (1954). So, what happened between 1954 and 1964? How can the hinted change in the politics of knowledge be explained and how was it linked with body images (individual and collective ones)? This talk explores those questions focusing historically on the formation of “empirische Bildungsforschung“ in Western Germany since 1945. Furthermore, it pursues to some extent the relation between “knowledge” and “body” as historiographical categories. [bibliography] Becker, Hellmut, Die verwaltete Schule.

[Paper III] Music education as “Statte der Kollektivbildung“ (site for the formation of the social collective) in GDR, 1961-1989 (Josefine Wahler, Research Library for the History of Education (BBF, Berlin)/ Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin (HU); josefine.waehler@web.de) The allegedly community-building effect of music plays an important role in many cultures, not least because of the emotions that are said to be provoked and transported by it. These collective-forming and emotional aspects of music, particularly its aesthetic impact, was in GDR co-opted by Party and State in support of their political statements and for the purpose of a marxist-ideological “Bildung und Erziehung” (Cultivation and Education). Music education in the education system of the GDR aimed to form “allseitig gebildete sozialistische Personlichkeiten” (well-rounded socialists). Music education was incorporated in the state-prescribed principle to implement the “Einheit von Bildung und Erziehung” in class. The acquisition of musical knowledge and skills enabled the students to understand the social function of music and to mobilize them to actively participate in the shaping of the cultural life of the GDR. Singing together as a class in school and outside in organized groups, as a collective practice, assumed a key function in GDR music education. It should demonstrate strength and solidarity inward and outwards and likewise express the attitude towards life in socialist society. This paper examines the extent that GDR music education between 1961 an 1989 served as “Statte der Kollektivbildung” and its system-stabilizing effects. My paper utilizes source materials from the archive and library collections at the Research Library for the History of Education in Berlin in order to examine the collective practices of singing, playing and listening to music, as well as the use of certain songs for “communitarization” and maintenance of social stability in GDR.

      "title": "Professional burnout as the state and process--what to do?",
      "abstract": "The professional staff in human service institutions is often required to spend time in intense involvement with other people. Frequently, the staff-client interaction is centred around the client's current problems (psychological, social, and/ or physical) and is therefore charged with feelings of anger, embarrassment, fear or despair In this article we follow the burnout which could not be only the consequence of such job characteristics but could appear also as the result of type of work organization, social relationships, and some bodies personal characteristics as life style, too. Moreover, it can be a consequence of a disturbed balance between give and take at all three levels of social exchange--at interpersonal, at the team, and at the organizational level. So burnout is not only the problem of individuals but also the problem of social environment in which they work. The workplaces shape how people interact with another and how they carry out their jobs. In addition, we try to find the ways how to prevent or to reduce burnout, too. So we present the theories of social comparison (Festinger, 1954; Schachter, 1959), equity theory (Walster and Berscheid, 1978), as also the Kahn's model of employee engagement (1990) and the Schaufeli- Buunk's integrative comprehensive social exchange model (1993) as the possible key to help individuals and organization. In this context V. also Frankl's logo therapy (sense of purpose, 1960) became much more important as the theories of positive (Seligman, 2000) and humanistic psychology (Maslow, 1971, 1987; Rogers, 1959), too.",

      "title": "When to swim with or against the tide? Preschoolers’ conformity to social and eating behaviors and individual differences",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Kim, Elizabeth | Advisor(s): Chen, Chuansheng | Abstract: Social norms play an important role in guiding individuals’ behavior in society. By following social norms, individuals benefit from the knowledge a given society or culture has accumulated in its interactions with the natural world and management of social relations. While adherence to others’ norms can encourage beneficial decisions, such as recycling (Schultz, 1999) and energy conservation (Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, a Griskevicius, 2007), it can also lead individuals to make irrational decisions, such as making perceptually incorrect or potentially harmful judgments (Asch, 1956; Milgram, 1963; Zimbardo, 1973). Thus, it is important to explore conformity to group norms to better understand how social pressure might spur or maintain beneficial or maladaptive behavior. Past research has focused on adults with little attention given to conformist behavior in early childhood, social conformity across various domains, as well as alternative modes of conforming (anticonformity; Willis, 1963). Additionally, factors related to the act of conforming to peer groups have been underexplored. To extend basic research on early conformist behaviors and to allow for translational findings that might help promote positive growth for young children, two socially important behavior domains (moral/social-conventional judgments, food eating behaviors) were chosen to investigate the effects of conformity among preschoolers.In a series of four studies, this dissertation aimed to (1) examine the extent to which preschoolers conform and anticonform to peers’ social norms in different domains (judgment about antisocial and unconventional behaviors in Study 1, healthy food preferences in Study 2, healthy and unhealthy food portions in Study 3, and actual food consumption in Study 4 (with drinks); and (2) examine whether maturity-related individual characteristics (age, inhibitory control, theory of mind) and activities and parenting practices facilitate conformity and/or anticonformity. Three-to-6 year olds from preschools in Singapore were tested in the four studies (N =58 in Study 1; N = 89 in Study 2; N = 75 in Study 3; N = 89 in Study 4). Results showed conformity effects across moral/social-conventional judgments and all three food eating behaviors, suggesting that peers (even ones that are not present) can change initial judgments and behavior in domains of social importance. Evidence for anticonformity was also found for moral/social-conventional judgments and healthy food preferences, demonstrating that some preschoolers tended to counter social pressure. Preschoolers’ participation in extracurricular activities was found to be associated with moral conformity as well as conformity to peers’ healthy food portion selections. Age and BMI were also linked to conformity in food/drink choice and portion selection behaviors, indicating that some inherent traits were likely to be associated with peer influence in eating behaviors. Although correlates of conformity were sporadic, all but one were consistent with the predicted direction that higher social cognitive maturity would be associated with higher conformity to healthy eating behaviors and lower conformity to moral transgressions. In sum, findings from these set of studies shed light on the complex interplay of prudence and trust that preschoolers place on peers in social learning, and the association of various child characteristics and parenting with differentiated conformity to socially relevant norms. Some limitations include not measuring BMI for all food–related studies (due to time constraints) as well as not including follow-up questions as to why children did or did not agree with the group. Future research should examine conformity among young children in other health-related behaviors, in which peers may promote beneficial behavior.",

      "title": "MULTI CULTURE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS TOWARD VARIOUS SOCIAL CONFLICTS IN INDONESIA",
      "abstract": "Theoretically, multi culture is a potential culture that can reflect a national identity. While historically, multi culture is a component that is essential in the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia. In addition, multi culture can also be a cultural capital and a cultural power that drive the dynamics of the nation’s life. However, on the other hand, multi culture also has the potential to give rise to a conflict that could threaten national integration because the conflict between cultures can lead to clashes among ethnic groups, religion, and races which are very sensitive and vulnerable. This condition can surely harm the nation’s integration. It may occur if the conflict is not controlled and resolved wisely. In the last two decades, various social conflicts caused by multi-culture is increasing, in terms of both quality and quantity. Various social conflicts such as in Aceh, Timika (Papua), Ambon (Maluku), Pontianak (West Kalimantan), Sampit-Mataram (NTB), Poso (Central Sulawesi) and Mesuji (Lampung) are examples of cases of social conflicts caused by ethnic and religious clashes, and/or between races that occurred in various regions in Indonesia. Thus, social conflict is an inevitable thing in our social life. Therefore, one thing that needs to be done is how the conflicts can be controlled and resolved peacefully and wisely, so they do not cause social disintegration in the life of society, nation and state.

Be it in families, in couple relationships, in the workplace, or in our towns and cities, the individual is obliged to make « identity-based commitments » (Bajoit, 2003). After a brief presentation of this new social context, we will review a number of areas in which self-efficacy plays a crucial role (health, community service, education…), while focusing on the particular role which it can play in the context of raising a family. We will also see how the ideologies of « success » and « achievement » may produce for some individuals notable forms of identity-based/social suffering.",

      "title": "Fair or Unfair Differentiation? Reconsidering the Concept of Equality for the Regulation of Algorithmically Guided Decision-Making.",
      "abstract": "Algorithms are increasingly relied upon to help decision-makers automate, streamline, structure and guide a variety of decision-making processes, ranging from trivial to critical, in both the public and private sector. This dissertation is concerned with a specific type of injustice that may come along with the development and deployment of algorithmically guided decision-making systems: the emergence of unjust (in)equality brought about by various instances of differentiation and differential treatment that take place within and as part of these systems. In this data-driven environment, people and groups of people are continuously classified, categorised, ranked and scored on a variety of features or attributes, such as their characteristics, interests, behaviour and preferences. For decision-subjects, these differentiation acts can generate significant consequences regarding their social position and life’s prospects: they affect the choices and options they are presented, the interactions and relationships they hold with others and themselves, the opportunities they are given, the burdens and benefits they carry, and so forth. Yet, when applied on a large enough scale, these decisions may also initiate significant societal change. Due to the complexity of the digital environment and the distinctive characteristics algorithmically guided decisions exhibit, it has become increasingly difficult to assess whether the decisions these knowledge and data-driven systems inform, and the (in)equalities they produce, can be justified. As a consequence, uncertainty exists as to whether current and future regulatory efforts, and the approach to equality they (will) adhere to, have the capacity to respond to the egalitarian harms algorithms risk to introduce in an appropriate manner.In this dissertation, I reposition and operationalise the notion of equality as a practicable and interpretative lens to strengthen the evaluation and regulation of algorithmically guided decision-making practices in light of the inequalities they (risk to) produce. This dissertation begins with a definition of the algorithmic research context in which the notion of equality will be operationalised. I explore a series of characteristics that typify algorithmic systems and render the inequalities they generate distinctive in terms of their form and scope. Due to these unique characteristics, algorithmic inequalities have the potential to restructure the fabric of society alongside new and existing dimensions: they may not only reinforce existing social injustice, but they may also introduce new forms of non-representational injustice (Chapter 1). Drawing inspiration from both European equality and non-discrimination law and political philosophical theories of justice, and informed by the (practical) functioning of algorithmic decision-making systems and the particular challenges these bring along, I propose equality as a multidimensional concept that can be specified alongside three (interrelated) axes. The model represents a core set of ideals commonly associated with the notion of equality as a social value: equal concern and respect (the moral dimension), equal social standing and equal social relationships (the socio-relational dimension), and/or equal access to certain justice-relevant goods (the distributive dimension) (Chapter 2). Throughout this dissertation, this multidimensional understanding of equality is operationalised to identify, articulate and evaluate algorithmic injustice, and the response formulated thereto within a given policy, law, code or theory. In a first step, my understanding of equality is positioned against the algorithmic environment in order to articulate and identify the egalitarian harms algorithms risk to impose onto decision-subjects and society at large (Part I: Identification, Chapter 2). In a second step, the multidimensional model functions as a support mechanism to uncover and evaluate the legal conceptualisation of equality found within European equality and non-discrimination law (Council of Europe and European Union). By investigating whom the law protects (equality of whom?) against which inequalities (what egalitarian ideals do they promote?) and how (what review mechanisms have been put in place when equality is positioned against competing values?), I assess whether the legal approach to equality can address the injustice algorithms risk to introduce (Part II: Evaluation; Chapters 3-5). In a third step, I rely upon the model to locate and examine specific notions of equality – chosen due to their correspondence with the aforementioned dimensions. These socio-relational (domination and oppression) and distributive (primary goods and capabilities) notions are examined to concretise the egalitarian harms algorithms risk to produce, the conditions under which these harms may manifest in practice, and the safeguards that can be provided to protect decision-subjects and society at large against them (Part III: Navigation; Chapter 6 and 7). Finally, based upon my findings, I formulate a set of normative recommendations aimed at repositioning the concept of equality within the algorithmic governance debate in an effort to strengthen its guiding function for the evaluation and regulation of algorithmically informed decision-making systems (Part IV: Synthesis; Chapter 8).",

      "abstract": "Community interventions represent a key component of the current anti-smoking strategies. We propose a conceptual framework for classifying these interventions, based on the concept of community utilised in different studies. We identified 5 different focuses: geographical areas (i.e. city, county, region); targets (sub-group of a population); settings (school, workplace); culture and individual attitudes; multilevel networks. These two latter views refer to functional rather than to structural aspects of a community and they represent the most promising approaches to design intervention strategies. Communities are represented as a group of organizations, systems and social networks investigating individual, environmental and cultural factors that can strongly influence behavioural changes. The great heterogeneity in what the authors mean as community interventions has in our opinion affected the evaluation of their impact. To facilitate their evaluation and to contribute to the detection of determinants, as well as of barriers, it is necessary to compare community interventions sharing similar theoretical approaches and focuses. Also, studies aimed at assessing the steps of the implementation process of community programmes may allow to identify those components related to specific levels of intervention, thus enabling the generalisation of results. To reach this goal it may be helpful to combine study designs allowing for both quantitative and qualitative assessments, such as action research and participatory evaluation research.",

      "title": "Social Work and Criminal Justice:",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY We shall begin with the principal, and complicated, conclusion: Regrettably, the social work profession has largely abandoned the criminal justice field. That is not to say that social workers are not employed in criminal justice settings. Certainly they are. Significant numbers of social workers earn their living as probation and parole officers, caseworkers in public defender offices, counselors in correctional institutions and halfway houses, and so on. As a profession, however, social work no longer has a major presence in the criminal justice field (Gibelman and Schervish, 1993). Relatively few social workers embark on their professional education with the aim of employment in the criminal justice field. Virtually no courses in social work education programs focus explicitly or comprehensively on criminal justice (Knox and Roberts, 2002; McNeece and Roberts, 1997). Workshops offered at professional conferences or continuing education seminars rarely focus on criminal justice issues per se. And, relatively little serious scholarship on criminal justice issues is authored by social workers. Interestingly, this has not always been the state of affairs. Earlier in the profession's history, social workers were much more visible and vocal participants in dialogue, debate, research, and practice related to criminal justice. Ideally-in light of social work's unique perspectives on practice and social problems, and the profession's noble value base-the profession will reclaim its preoccupation with criminal justice. As Sarri (2001) concludes with respect to social workers' involvement in the juvenile justice system in particular: Thirty years ago, social workers were in leadership positions in juvenile justice in the majority of states. In the 1980s, a gradual decline began in agencies and in social work education for practice in juvenile justice. Some have suggested that the decline was at least partially due to professional resistance to working in coercive settings with involuntary clients. However, given the millions of people now caught up in the criminal justice system who are not receiving the social services they desperately need, it is a priority that social work return to a more central role in criminal justice.

Significant social changes can also take place both before and after the phases of the most intense physical activities (construction, production, expansion), and pathways of influence can be social as well as physical. At the outset, during the \"opportunity-threat\" stage, most social and economic impacts are associated with opportunities and/or threats to biophysical, economic, social, cultural, and psychological systems of the human environment. If development proceeds, the opportunities and threats are joined by the impacts of visible, physical perturbations that have received most of the attention to date. Over time, both of these sets of impacts are increasingly joined by the accumulation of experience. While human systems do adapt to changes or impacts, even apparently functional short-term responses can lead over the longer term to overadaptation.",

Field domination emerges over time with the stabilization of an unambiguous hierarchy and is associated with an increasing institutionalization, structuration and ordering that occur mostly through the deployment of isomorphic pressures (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). At the actor level, this process results in conformity to the hierarchy, the alignment of meanings, expectations and behaviour of field members; it tends to increase consensus, decrease ambiguity and inhibit contention and contestation. Conversely, fields without a dominant hierarchy are associated with diversity and heterogeneity at the field level, and contention and contestation at the actor level. This lack of domination results from the distribution of authority sources among multiple legitimate bodies and an overlap of institutional pressures with which to comply. It leads to the co-existence of multiple meanings, expectations and behaviour about what counts in a field; it also tends to increase contention and raise the degree of ambiguity and complexity. In sum, viewed a-historically, the greater the domination there is at a field level, the lower the amount of contention one observes at the actor level.",

      "title": "Vulnerability, Resiliency, and Dignity: Psychosocial Dimensions of the Refugee Experience",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Within the realm of refugee work, tend to be labeled when compared to legal, economic, and medical perspectives. The term itself encompasses many different ways of applying psychology and other social science knowledge, ranging from a clinical focus on individuals to broad community strategies. Often, professionals with shared backgrounds, such as psychologists, hold divergent beliefs and adopt different roles when employing psychosocial in their work with refugees and survivors of violence. As one participant explained it at a meeting of psychosocial workers from Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Uganda, is not everything, but it is in every program. But in an effort to avoid the mere tokenization of words like psychosocial, participation, and process, there are growing calls in the field for new ways of relating to and caring for refugees and survivors, listening more closely to their voices, and recognizing the specificities of the refugee context. One of the founding fathers of participatory action research (PAR), Orlando Fals-Borda, argues that the three primary strategic tensions shaping how we work with populations different from our own involve ongoing debates about (1) theory and praxis, (2) the subject versus the object in research or applied work, and (3) cosmovision and value systems. Also, it can be argued that there are three different groups of interest, each requiring a different lens, that converge when doing general refugee work. First, there are the refugees and survivors who want to have their basic needs met, strive to rebuild their lives, and demand justice and visibility. Second, there are the researchers and workers who want to understand the dynamics of conflict and recovery, and to implement programs. And third, there are the elites and institutions in charge of the transitional phase, eager to leave the violent times behind and to move forward (while often denying the survivors' right to memory). Although these three collectives agree on the basic goal of ameliorating the impact of violence, they usually differ--often considerably--in their understanding of what dignifies, who should define the needs, and how best to implement the programs. The rigor of the validity-reliability dyad, and of evidence-based more generally, is difficult to find in the field of applied refugee research and work. The soft approaches to research more commonly found here are guided by the complexity of the contexts and by the participation of the refugees themselves. It seems that it is often hard for some university scholars to understand this, given the priorities of their laboratories and classrooms when compared to the realities of the field. In this issue, we present a collection of articles that represent a shared effort exploring how to better understand and communicate with the actors in the field, especially the refugees themselves, while also reflecting on the different narratives and tools that possible to do so (e.g., words and interviews, images, media articles, data). Together, these articles help move us toward thinking about the psychosocial perspective as a transversal approach, an approach that is an indispensable component of many programs regardless of their explicit focus, and an approach that is crucial in order to better grasp the culture, the values and priorities of the people, and the nuances of the refugee context. Mike Wessells opens the conversation by acknowledging the critiques of the psychosocial approach for the absence of 'hard evidence,' and makes a clear and experience based plea for critical self-awareness, and for the specificity of action. He reminds us of the basics, which cannot be emphasized enough: local empowerment and the restoration of dignity, enhancing the importance of culture, and the need to avoid the imposition of outside when working in refugee contexts. …",

      "abstract": "ed from any kind of wider integument. Symbolic interactionists and ethnomethodologists, in particular, have no explicit conceptualization of the supra-situational, of social structure or culture, as societal phenomena, even less of inter-societal cross-cultural or world-systemic relations the proper macrocontext, rather than the 'nation-state'.8 In dealing with the internal ordering of society, familiar intermediate categories like 'institution', 'class', 'level', 'domain', 'primary' and 'secondary' notions widely used by 'members' are not conceptualized explicitly, though they are often smuggled in because life has a habit of spilling over the edges of inadequate theoretical boxes. Nor is there any workedout temporal framework: development, history, and evolution become nonproblems, because history has to be the history of some substantive entity, such as a society, and evolution the evolution of types of society in successive epochs . To work with a social theory that mirabile dietu has no concept of society as an entity (however much we need to avoid 'systems' theory assumptions that underplay internal inconsistency and overemphasize the liminality of external boundaries) makes it impossible to produce a sociology which can answer to most of the major problems of understanding social life. Only a decade after Homans had had to argue for bringing men back into sociology, we have to plead for bringing society back in. This is by no means to denigrate whole modes of doing sociology. Anyone who fails to respond to the fine-grained and sensitive illumination of the everyday and the interpersonal provided by Erving GofFman would be a poor human being as well as a poor intellectual, for to read him is to experience a deepening of perception. It has been a mind-stretching experience for a whole generation whom he has taught, like Brecht, to look at the familiar in new ways, and the exotic as common human practice. Yet the exploration of the devices people use to manipulate others in face-toface encounters, to present images of themselves, to detect meanings informing others' behaviour in clues and cues provided or given off, is, in the end, to work within the confines of formal sociology. The usual riposte to that kind of criticism is to assert that relations are between men, and that it is only alienated thinking that persuades us, fetishistically, that we have relations with reified 'things' or 'forces'. A second, more substantive, riposte is that this kind of analysis can, with equal effectiveness, be applied to 'high level' groups, and that the Cabinet or the Politbureau is, after all, simply a small group.

      "title": "The Use of Conventional Expressions ofThanking, Apologizing, and Refusing",
      "abstract": "Different strands of pragmatics research have emphasized the importance of conventional expressions in the realization of speech acts. Cross-cultural comparisons of speech act realization by native speakers have caught our attention with titles derived from such culturally-based formulaic expressions as Poison to your soul (Coulmas, 1981) and May God increase your bounty (Bodman & Eisenstein, 1988). Even mundane expressions may be conventional, however, and Coulmas and others brought to our attention the role of conventional expressions as part of the social contract of communication. Coulmas (1981) describes conventional expressions as “tacit agreements, which the members of a community presume to be shared by every reasonable co-member. In embodying societal knowledge they are essential in the handling of day-to-day situations” (p. 4). The construct of “reasonable co-member” of a community is a natural link to second language pragmatics, as learners of the L2 may see themselves or be seen by others as joining a new speech community through language acquisition. Second language researchers are also interested in conventional expressions, although as often from the perspective of general L2 development as from L2 pragmatics (BardoviHarlig, 2006). In fact, Granger (1998) even attributes the research in pragmatics as one impetus to study formulas, observing that “the formulaic nature of many pragmalinguistic rules has necessarily contributed to bringing the study of prefabs to the fore” (p. 145). Although the use of conventional expressions has garnered significant attention from sociolinguisticallyand comparatively-oriented investigations in L2 pragmatics, there has been relatively less attention paid to conventional expressions from acquisitionally-focused research in L2 pragmatics. Early studies include Scarcella (1979) which examined the production of conventional expressions on a written DCT; more recent studies include Kecskes (2000, 2003) which investigated the interpretation of transparent and idiomatic formulas, Roever (2005) which examined the identification of formulas in appropriate settings, Bardovi-Harlig (in press) which explored the recognition of conventional expressions as pragmalinguistic resources, and Bardovi-Harlig et al (in press) which reported on the influence of the use of the expressions on length of learners’ turns. The strong cultural associations of conventional expressions as well as their highly consistent linguistic composition makes conventional expressions a natural area of exploration for L1 influence. This paper explores the influence of first language and level of development on the use of conventional expressions in the realization of three speech acts, namely, expressions of gratitude, apologies, and refusals. Using an experimental approach, we have sought to reproduce the conditions for the use of conventional expressions. We employed a computer-delivered aural discourse completion task (DCT) with timed presentation of scenarios and a recorded interlocutor to simulate turn taking, and through piloting have identified scenarios that promoted high use of conventional expressions by native speakers. With the exception of a few studies, the design of most investigations of first language influence compares the production of a single L1 group to the production of native speakers of the target language. The four main language groups in this study—Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean— permits the investigation of the influence of L1s across languages, following the research design for studies of L1 influence proposed by Jarvis (2000). Only a few interlanguage pragmatics studies have multiple L1s (Bodman & Eisenstein, 1988; Eisenstein & Bodman, 1986; Hinkel, 1994; Park & Nakano, 1999); without such studies, it is difficult to tell which characteristics of L2 pragmatic development are unique to specific languages or cultures, and which are shared by all learners.",

      "title": "Social Institutions and the Development Process: Using Cross-Disciplinary Insights to Build an Alternative Aid Architecture",
      "abstract": "The development process in any society fundamentally transforms social institutions – i.e. our identities, kinship systems, community organizations, religious sensibilities, norms, languages and networks. These transformations often occur in rather unsettling ways over non-linear trajectories, and thereby routinely (and perhaps inherently) defy technocratic attempts to anticipate, understand and respond to them. In both poor and rich countries alike, rising (and falling) wealth alters how people see themselves, how they regard strangers, the terms on which they relate to their families and communities, the accommodations and legitimacy they confer upon elites, and how the ‘social contract’ binding citizens and the state is structured and negotiated. Our contemporary international aid architecture, however, was not designed to address social institutional concerns, and often struggles to engage with them now that it finds itself needing to do so. For communities, nations and regions to prosper in ways that are (and are broadly perceived to be) legitimate and inclusive, a rather different approach to development is needed. Insights from theories and methods across the social sciences are giving rise to such alternatives (examples are provided); initial results are promising but it remains to be seen whether and how these can gain a more secure foothold.",

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "abstract": "The case studies tell stories of powerlessness and incapacity, of how movements and collective action run up against stronger forces, internal fragmentation and failures of coordination. The ability to network (i.e. horizontal relations with other social actors) across social sectors is a major success factor for social movements but we do not know enough about who are participating in social movement networks, or whether there are significant groups who are not involved and thus the overall representativeness of the truly poor and marginalized. Those formed between social movements and highly influential organizations, like political parties in office, have both positive and negative effects on social movement goals. The benefits of rescaling (the ability to bring claims to ‘higher’ arenas and institutions where power is wielded) for social movements include accessing the legitimacy, capacities and resources that like-minded organizations elsewhere might possess. Yet rescaling as a basis for collective action can perpetuate the democratic deficit, generate organizational overreach, create coordination problems with grassroots bases, and supplant and replace locally based alliances. The authors note that there is little research on social movement networking and rescaling that uses the concept of ‘the Americas’ as a basis for the repoliticization of poverty. Despite commonly shared forces that produce poverty in both the North and the South, deeply entrenched dualism is one force working against both more research and a more substantial development of such cross-continental linkages and imaginaries. El estudio relata historias de impotencia e incapacidad, de cómo los movimientos y la acción colectiva se enfrenta a fuerzas mayores, fragmentación interna y fallas de coordinación. La habilidad de relacionarse (es decir, relaciones horizontales con otros actores sociales) a través de sectores sociales es un factor de mayor éxito para los movimientos sociales, pero no sabemos lo suficiente sobre quiénes están participando en las redes de los movimientos sociales, o si existen grupos importantes que no están involucrados y de esa manera la representación general de los verdaderos pobres y marginados. Aquellos formados entre los movimientos sociales y las organizaciones altamente influenciables, como los partidos políticos en el poder, tienen tanto efectos positivos como negativos en los objetivos de los movimientos sociales. Los beneficios de reajuste (la habilidad de llevar las demandas a las arenas e instituciones de “mayor altura” donde se controla el poder) para los movimientos sociales incluyen el acceso a la legitimidad, capacidades y recursos que otras organizaciones afines en otra parte puedan poseer. Incluso el reajuste como una base para la acción colectiva, puede perpetuar el déficit democrático, generar un exceso institucional, crear problemas de coordinación con los organismos de base popular, y suplantar y sustituir a las alianzas con base local. Los autores advierten que hay poca investigación sobre las redes de movimientos sociales y el reajuste que usa el concepto de “las Américas” como una base para la repolitización de la pobreza. A pesar de fuerzas comúnmente compartidas que producen pobreza tanto en el norte como en el sur, un dualismo profundamente arraigado es una fuerza trabajando en contra de ambos, tanto de una mayor investigación como de un mayor desarrollo sustancial de tales conexiones imaginarias y de conexiones a través de los continentes. 本文的案例研究是关于无权和无能，关于社会运动和集体行为是如何遭遇强大阻力、内部分化以及协作失败的。社会各界之间的网络联系能力，例如与其他社会行为体的横向联系，是社会运动的一个主要成功因素，但我们对谁参与了社会运动网络知之甚少，不知道是否有重要的团体仍未被纳入，因而也不知道是否能完全代表真正的穷人和边缘群体。社会运动与极具影响力的组织之间（例如执政党）形成的网络对社会运动的目标有积极和消极两种影响。为社会运动重设标准（将诉求提升到权力行使的“更高”层次和机构的能力）的好处包括获得别处组织有可能拥有的合法性、能力和资源。然而，作为集体行动基础的重设标准会延续民主赤字，导致组织过度扩展，引发与基层组织的协调问题，并排挤和取代以地方为根基的联盟。本文指出，在有关社会运动网络和重设标准的研究中，“美洲”概念很少作为贫困再政治化的研究基础。尽管在南美和北美存在导致贫困的共同力量，但根深蒂固的二元论成为了阻碍更多研究，阻碍此类跨越大陆的联系与构想取得长足发展的一种力量。 사례연구들은 무력과 무능력의 이야기와 어떻게 강력한 세력에 대항하는 운동과 집합 행동이 성장하는가에 대한 이야기와, 내적인 분절과 조정의 실패 이야기를 들려준다. 사회 부문들을 넘어서 네트워크를 만들 수 있는 능력(다른 사회적 행위자와 수평적인 관계를 맺는 능력)은 사회운동의 주요 성공 요소이지만, 우리는 사회운동 네트워크에 누가 참여하는지 혹은 참여하지 않은 주요한 집단이 있는지 그리하여 정말로 빈민과 주변화된 사람들을 전반적으로 대표하는지에 대해서 충분히 할지 못한다. 사회운동과 정당과 같이 상당히 영향력 있는 조직들 간의 네트워크는 사회운동 목표에 긍정적인 면도 있고 부정적인 면도 있다. 사회운동에 미치는 리스케일링의 효과(요구를 권력이 행사되는 높은 영역이나 제도로 제기할 수 있는 능력)는 정당성, 능력 그리고 다른 지역의 유사한 조직들이 보유할 수도 있는 자원에 대한 평가를 포함한다. 그러나 집합행동의 기반으로 리스케일링은 민주적 결핍을 지속시키고, 조직적 불균형을 많고, 풀뿌리 조직과의 조정문제를 만들어 내며, 지역적으로 기반을 둔 동맹을 대체한다. 필자들은 사회운동 네트워크 형성과 빈곤의 재정치화의 토대로서 “아메리카인” 개념을 사용하는 리스케일링에 대한 연구가 거의 없다는 것을 지적한다. 남북아메리카에서 가난을 낳는 공통적인 힘에도 불구하고, 뿌리깊은 이중구조가 더 많은 연구와 더 본질적인 남북 아메리카의 연계와 상상력의 발전에 장애가 된다.",

Sociohistorical inquiry involves wicked problems: those having a variety of dynamic event states and essential variables with values and relationships that may be hidden and therefore unknown or indeterminable (Churchman, 1967).

Such activities are designed to foster trust, cohesiveness, communication and positive social interaction skills (Kome & Crean, 1986:183).

It is true that all forms of poverty cannot be explained by conflicts as much as all conflicts cannot be attributed to poverty. But, in many economically backward states, poverty and conflict have largely a two-way relationship; poverty is both a cause and consequence of conflict. There is a broad consensus on the definition of chronic poverty as severe deprivation of basic human needs over an extended period of time. But there is no unanimity as to what constitutes the basic needs. Over a period of time, the 'basic needs' has expanded to encompass not only food, water, shelter and clothing, but access to other assets such as education, health, participation in political process, security and dignity. Those who are chronically poor are poor in several ways and often suffer multi-dimensional poverty - food scarcity; lack of resources to send their children to school or provide health care for the sick (Hulme, Moore and Shepherd 2005).",

      "title": "Learning to be Oromo: Nationalist Discourse in the Diaspora",
      "abstract": "Processes of migration, diaspora and exile offer diverse and complex environments for the renegotiation of social identities. Immigrants and refugees must not only adapt to the material circumstances of uprooting but must also confront, maintain or recreate a sense of self, often in contexts which are vastly different and fraught with constraints, in which they are removed from their familiar social networks and in which their previous identities may be of little meaning or relevance to the new society. In confronting an altered social status and radically different circumstances, individuals may be required to come to terms with a new or reconstructed sense of ethnic or national identity. This process is not only a personal one but involves affiliations with others who engage in similar interpretations and adaptive strategies and enmity toward those who do not' Field, 1994: 432 . Such a process can be seen as part of the phenomenon of transnationalism, the process by which immigrants forge and sustain multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement' Basch et al., 1994: 7 . One important aspect of transnationalism is the role that immigrants and refugees play in political activities in both their countries of origin and residence, and their political commitment often has important implications for their sense of self, particularly when those political activities are directed towards the creation of a new homeland for oppressed minorities. This paper examines the role played by diaspora intellectuals in promoting a nationalist discourse which calls for the creation of an independent state for the Oromo, who constitute one of the largest ethnic populations in Africa and the manner in which their participation in such discursive activities allow them to engage in a reconstruction of their own identities and in the shaping of national and personal senses of the self.",

      "title": "Diversity Climate in Organizations",
      "abstract": "Although defined in numerous and sometimes inconsistent ways in the literature, diversity climate can be described as employees’ shared perceptions of the extent to which their organization values diversity as reflected in the policies, practices, and procedures that the organization rewards, supports, and expects. Diversity climate studied at the individual level (individual perceptions of the impact of the work environment on the individual’s own well-being) is referred to as psychological climate. When it is conceived of and studied at the group or organization level (employees’ shared perceptions of their work environment aggregated to the unit level), it is referred to as group- or organizational-level climate. Two consistent criticisms raised in recent reviews continue to plague diversity climate research. These can most simply be stated as a lack of clarity about what diversity climate is and is not, and inconsistency in how diversity climate is measured and aligns (or does not) with how it has been conceptualized. Despite these criticisms, there is evidence that diversity climate can positively impact individuals’ (especially minority group members’) work-related attitudes (e.g., organizational commitment, satisfaction) and unit-level outcomes (e.g., performance). As a result, diversity climate is both practically relevant to organizations and conceptually meaningful to researchers.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous agents usually operate as a multi-agent community performing actions within a shared social context to achieve their individual and collective objectives. In such a social context, their actions are influenced via two broad forms of motivations. First, the internal influences reflect the intrinsic motivations that drive the individual agent to achieve its own internal objectives. Second, as agents reside and operate within a social community, the social context itself influences their actions. Here, we categorise these latter forms as social influences. Now, in many cases, both these forms of influence may be present and they may give conflicting motivations to the individual agent. For instance, an agent may be internally motivated to perform a specific action, whereas, at the same time, it may also be subject to an external social influence not to perform it. Furthermore, agents usually have to perform their actions in environments with incomplete information. Thus, for instance, they may not be aware of the existence of all the social influences that could or indeed should affect their actions.",

      "abstract": "Las dinamicas complejas en las que se insertan los procesos de estratificacion de las sociedades contemporaneas -expansion generalizada de los niveles de consumo; cambio de las actividades productivas (de manuales a no-manuales)- obligan a redefinir conceptos de los estudios clasicos de movilidad social. Los estilos de vida, las pautas de consumo, la segmentacion espacial, las estrategias educativas, etc. se han de imbricar con la estructura ocupacional, variable determinante en los estudios de estratificacion social.\nEn este articulo nos proponemos analizar los procesos de movilidad social descendente como desclasamiento, diferenciandolo del empobrecimiento. Para ello recurrimos al binomio analitico condicion y posicion de clase (Bourdieu, Cachon, etc.), que puede arrojar luz sobre las modalidades que asume, en diferentes fracciones de las clases medias, la declinacion social. La ruptura con la tendencia a la �mesocratizacion difusa� (Tezanos), acentuada por los procesos de dualizacion social, imprime en la estructura de clases sociales una zona gris o de amortiguacion (Parkin) entre clases medias y bajas, que depende en gran medida de la trayectoria social de origen. Indagamos las estrategias que instrumentan los agentes para reproducir y mejorar su posicion de clase: reconvierten capitales (economico y cultural, fundamentalmente); se desplazan geograficamente; cambian de estilos de vida; etc. Para entender los conceptos y las dinamicas novedosas en la estructura social atendemos en este articulo al caso paradigmatico de las clases medias argentinas.",

      "abstract": "Como afectan los diferentes perfiles sociodemograficos, socioeconomicos y socioeducativos que existen entre los descendientes de migrantes en Cataluna en su rendimiento linguistico y sus actitudes linguisticas? Dar respuesta a esta cuestion es el objetivo de esta comunicacion. \r\n\r\nEn sociedades oficialmente (o de facto) monolingues, una de las dimensiones esenciales de cara a una satisfactoria integracion de los descendientes de migrantes es la linguistica, proceso se complejiza en sociedades bilingues. Pero la propia integracion linguistica es tambien multidimensional. De este modo, el conocimiento linguistico alcanzado en las lenguas de la sociedad entronca con la esfera socioeducativa (y derivada de ella la futura socioeconomica), mientras que las actitudes linguisticas lo hacen con la sociocultural. Por otro lado, no es menos cierto que los perfiles de los descendientes de migrantes van evolucionando con el tiempo, si bien se tiende a tener una vision monolitica de ellos (principalmente por origen) (Berry, 2009; Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Rumbaut, 2004; Portes, Fernandez-Kelly & Haller, 2009). Con este marco teorico de fondo y situados en Cataluna, se aplico a un total de 533 jovenes de 10 Institutos de Educacion Secundaria dos pruebas de conocimiento linguistico (de catalan y castellano), asi como un cuestionario sociodemografico y actitudinal. El analisis de datos se llevo a cabo a traves de un analisis cluster y regresiones logisticas. \r\n\r\nLos principales resultados indican que existen diferentes perfiles entre los descendientes de migrantes, siendo la principal variable de agrupacion la cohorte generacional (al contrario de lo que se podria suponer y mas importante que el origen o el nivel socioeconomico y socioeducativo familiar). Respecto al nivel de conocimiento de las lenguas se observa que el hecho de pertenecer a conglomerados que incluyen jovenes de las cohortes 1.75 y 2.0 (nacidos en Cataluna o llegados a muy temprana edad) predice un mejor conocimiento de ambas lenguas y mejores actitudes hacia el catalan, elemento que no se da en el caso del castellano.",

A fair amount of research has demonstrated that the stressor-strain process is similar across cultures, but there seems to be differences in the way that people from varied cultures perceive and cope with stressors. Furthermore, social identity (or unemployment status) can lead to stigmatization, such that perceived outgroup status can lead to prejudice (i.e., negative attitudes), discrimination (i.e., unfair treatment), token status, and invisibility/hypervisibility. Despite the focus on workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion, there is little understanding of the unique experiences of minority or stigmatized group members within job stress.

These problems are called “wicked” because they have the following characteristics: 1). There is no definitive statement of the problem; in fact, there is broad disagreement on what ‘the problem’ is. 2). Without a definitive statement of the problem, the search for solutions is open ended. Stakeholders – those who have a stake in the problem and its solution – champion alternative solutions and compete with one another to frame ‘the problem’ in a way that directly connects their preferred solution and their preferred problem definition. 3). The problem solving process is complex because constraints, such as resources and political ramifications, are constantly changing. 4). Constraints also change because they are generated by numerous interested parties who “come and go, change their minds, fail to communicate, or otherwise change the rules by which the problem must be solved” (Conklin and Weil, no date: 1).",

Current listening approaches rely on the agency in the listener to listen at individual and mass levels. However, the absence of engagement of agency in the listened to limits its transformation potential to individual levels. SALT (Support/Appreciate/Listen/Team) based listening connects to the agency of the listened to at scale through home- and neighborhood-based conversations. Experiences of using SALT in drug de-addiction, a community development via a corporate social responsibility program, and a suicide survivor support program reveal three distinct characteristics of transformation at scale. These are as follows: (1) SALT is a mindset that listens to strengths, hopes, and concerns in people; (2) listening and agency building at scale is embedded in a process of home- and neighborhood-based reflective learning; and (3) empowerment of communities beyond geographic boundaries is possible through organic transfer and adaptation of organizational practices. Acknowledging the common humanity that underlies the listener and listened to opens doors for deep listening, mutual listening, and transformative listening in homes, neighborhoods, and institutions.",

We examined the relationship between social contact (engagement in activities alone or in the presence of others), difficulties experienced with daily activities when with people or when alone, everyday satisfaction, and self-reported autonomy. Greater levels of social contact are associated with greater everyday satisfaction as long as participants report no difficulty in daily activities. However, greater levels of social contact are associated with lower self-reported autonomy among very old participants (85-104 years) and social contact is unrelated to self-reported autonomy among old participants (70-84 years). The findings suggest that the compensatory use of social resources and the selective narrowing of social contact in daily activities contribute to adaptive everyday functioning in later life.",

      "abstract": "Stuttering is a disorder which is manifested during a communicational interaction, and is experiential in nature. While the etiology for stuttering is still in question among researchers, most agree that the experience of stuttering may be highly related to various factors, of which environment plays a significant role. The environment of an individual has been described in circles (Bronfenbrenner, 1979), to depict the different layers which encompass the person in his daily life, such as family, friends, educational or work settings and strangers. Beyond those, the largest external circle of Bronfenbrenner (1979), i.e., the macro-system, represents society or culture. The behavior and approach of society to the PWS has been described repeatedly ascrucial towards the quality of life and coping strategies of the PWS. Negative attitudes and stereotypes towards PWS have been reported in several countries from around the world (Kuwait, Turkey, China) and specific behaviors towards PWS within African countries or Indiantribes have been described. Nevertheless, only few researches have explored the experience of stuttering within the social context. The present qualitative study explored the experience of stuttering within two opposing social groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jews and the secular Jews, in order to characterize the different needs of PWS in these groups and identify differences in their ability to cope with their stuttering, which might be the result of their specific social context. Eight adult PWS were recruited for this study, between the ages of 22-62 years: four ultra-Orthodox Jews and four secular Jews. In-depth interviews were conducted with each participant separately for two hours on average, using a semi-structured format which consisted of nineteen open ended questions. Questions included various topics, e.g. child and adolescence memories of living with stuttering, the influence of stuttering on the individual, self attitudes toward stuttering. After concluding the interviews, a transcript of each interview was achieved and analyzed. Analysis of the transcriptions was performed using concept driven and data driven strategies. Holistic reading of interviews suggested four main dimensions: the experience of stuttering across the life span, coping strategies with the stuttering, the experience of therapy, and personal insights. Each of these was then categorized into categories and sub categories. Initial analysis demonstrated a great emotional content, different anxiety experiences and special speech roles among ultra-orthodox interviewees in comparison to the secular interviewees. Our findings describe the experience of stuttering and its relation to the social context. However, it is also suggested that the experience of stuttering is \"universal\" and despite the different circumstances, similarities may be found in the individual's coping strategies and experiences with therapy. Following the presentation of findings, clinical implications will be suggested.",

Si les organisations sont des entités complexes constituées à la fois des parties prenantes et des interactions entre ces diverses parties prenantes, alors l'information n'a plus pour seul objet de réduire l'asymétrie d'information, elle a également pour objet de contribuer à la vitalité de l'organisation qui naît des interactions multiples entre ces parties prenantes. L'information passe d'un intérêt privé à un intérêt commun. L'intérêt privé est celui des acteurs, des parties prenantes. L'intérêt commun est celui qui émerge de l'existence de l'organisation, non pas acteur individuel, mais acteur collectif lui-même composé d'acteurs individuels (et/ou collectifs). Parce qu'elle façonne les interaction entre les acteurs, la comptabilité exige la prise en compte de l'interaction complexe entre la nécessité de principes comptables qui favorisent une vision universelle, et une harmonisation de la diversité des normes et des usages à un niveau territorial.",

      "title": "Mental Health and Housing",
      "abstract": "Mental health and housing. Kari-Koskinen, O. and Karvonen, P. (Dept. of Public Health, Oulu University, Oulu, Finland). With the present trend away from the designing of individual buildings and towards the systematic planning of whole residential communities, it should be possible to take mental health requirements into account at the planning stage. At present, sociologists are all too seldom consulted on matters of residential planning. When discussing the relationship between housing and mental health one cannot restrict oneself only to the external aspects of the house, but rather one must also consider the opportunities available for the members of the family to satisfy their own needs, both within the home and in its immediate surroundings. Factors which may affect residential requirements include geographical location, type and standard of dwelling and time and continuity of occupation. A move between two districts or groups representing different housing norms and values may lead to withdrawal symptoms in the individual. This may arise equally well from the remoteness of the country districts as from the conflicting pressures brought on by the abundance of contacts available in the large towns. Town life tends to heighten susceptibility to neuroses and personality conflicts. The character of a residential area may affect the mental health of its occupants. Faris &amp; Dunham (4), in studying the incidence of various types of mental illness with an urban population, observed that schizophrenia was most common among people who were in some way isolated from social involvement. The striving for spaciousness in residential areas and the creation of a “summer city” or “garden city” image or a “family-centred way of life” may lead to unexpected problems and have a variety of social consequences. Mental health difficulties have been noted, for example, among housewives in “dormitory” towns or suburbs (11). The institutions required by a community may be grouped into four categories, representing the basic needs of its members. These are (1) economic institutions, (2) social and political organizations, (3) leisure-time clubs and (4) societies and institutions for promoting social integration, including educational, advisory and assistance bodies. The study of satiation processes offers an interesting approach to the relationship between housing and mental health. Man requires new stimuli to motivate him. Boredom and satiation serve to induce passivity and may provoke destructive behaviour and escapism. Finland has the highest percentage of dwellings constructed in the immediate post-war period of any country in Europe, and in respect of the functions of housing many aspects are still apparent which are detrimental to mental health.",

      "title": "Spectacular Transgressions: Moving beyond Polarities",
      "abstract": "Spectacular Transgressions: Moving beyond Polarities John Fletcher (bio) and Sonja Arsham Kuftinec (bio) What can spectacular transgressions teach us about protest? How can we learn to see through clouds of outrage or move differently among polarized factions? In this essay we explore two sites of transgression, coal rolling and public dance, to deepen and expand the possibilities of protest beyond polarities. Recognizing the scholarship and praxis that already exists across the political spectrum,1 we enter the conversation about protest via our prior work on “spectacular transgressions” in activist performance.2 “Activist performance” or “performance for social change” casts a wide net, encompassing phenomena from massive marches and civilly disobedient direct actions to Boalian workshops and community-engaged devised productions. To speak of protest narrows the view somewhat, and we use the term here to name expressive public acts (thus performances) by individuals or groups aligned with larger efforts to realize a change in society, government, and/or culture. Usually protests communicate both challenge (protesting against “what is”) and advocacy (protesting for “what ought to be”). Our present intervention grows from an even finer focus on those protests that qualify as spectacular transgressions, by which we mean attention-grabbing, larger-than-life crossings (trans-) of a line or norm (-gradi). Describing an act or event as a spectacle suggests something not just spectate-able, but especially spectate-worthy—spectate-imperative even. Amy Hughes argues that spectacle mobilizes a difference in physical and/or affective scale from the “normal” to attract attention (15–16). Not all transgressions or spectacles function as protests, of course. But signature Left/progressive activist protests such as the civil rights lunch-counter sit-ins, the 1999 WTO demonstrations, and the Occupy Wall Street camps all share a quality of spectacular (although often precisely choreographed and disciplined) boundary violation.3 Why focus on spectacularly transgressive protests? We do not claim that spectacular transgressions are the most common or effective protest modes. In the twenty-first century, however, being attention-grabbing and controversial means being spreadable, meme-able, known. Techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci observes that both present-day activism and mass media operate within an attention economy. Individuals and collectives compete for the eyes and ears (and thus the hearts and minds) of a populace inundated with countless counter-offers. Since, as she notes, “[a]ttention is a key resource for social movements” (849), spectacularly transgressive protests offer an enticing promise of return on investment. Today, grand-scale, attention-demanding protests such as anti-police-violence activists shutting down a highway, openly armed citizens gathering at a public restaurant, or professional athletes kneeling during the national anthem have come to serve as some of the most recognizable reference points for present cultural and political struggles. Although such spectacles do not represent social movements’ only or most common tools, in the public imagination of the attention economy, activist groups often become equated to their most visible, viral, and controversial protests. We also concentrate on spectacular protests for their polarizing effects. Tactical polarization—provoking fence-sitters out of their apathy—has long been a specialized weapon in activist arsenals (Abujbara et al. 76, 116). Today, however, a range of scholars has begun to worry about an excess of polarization in US civic and political life. Disagreements are sharper, more extreme, with [End Page 139] Democrats and Republicans more apt to view the other party not merely as wrong, but as a “threat to the nation’s well-being” (Pew 7). The multiplicity of information sources circulating through social media allows us to indulge in group and confirmation biases as never before.4 Lamenting this myopic hyper-partisanship, Lee Drutman warns of “doom loop politics.” Within the doom loop of polarization, “beating our opponent” (whom we know to be evil, irrational, ignorant, a threat, and so on) eclipses all other considerations.5 As scholars of activist performance, we (the coauthors) find ourselves probing this polarization. From Pew’s perspective we would likely fit into the Left’s ideologically consistent partisan space. We support and write about multifarious resistance tactics against the current political administration. Yet, we also recognize the dangers of polarization that Drutman and others outline.

      "abstract": "All assessment of future domestic development projects assumes that the problems to be examined have been properly identified and defined before the application of a projection technique. An attempt is made to codify socio-cultural problems mentioned in literature and clarify how existing demographic projection techniques can be applied to assessing the problems. The relationship between changes in local population size and composition induced by in-migration and the potential for socio-cultural incompatibilities is described heuristically. For simplification, the problems expected to emerge from differences in demographic composition are classified into three categories: (1) service needs, such as those for housing, recreation, and education; (2) types of social organizations related to capacities for, or constraints on, reaping the benefits of rapid economic development and social changes (e.g., employment and income); and (3) attitudes, values, and cultural perspectives. These areas of concern are very broad, and quantitative projections of population size and composition are more easily related to the first than to the third. Although demographic projection provides a valuable tool for estimating future social change, the knowledge about cause and effect is not sufficient to support the quantification of socio-cultural impact. Therefore, the projections are used only as relative indicators and the assessments of socio-cultural impact based on them are qualitative only. Therefore, identification and assessment of socio-cultural impacts are a means of developing plans to overcome the expected problems.",

      "title": "Introduction: Themed Section on Exploring Multiple Exclusion Homelessness",
      "abstract": "Many of New Labour's welfare initiatives were underpinned by a stated desire to combat social exclusion among disadvantaged sections of the population. Allied to this, a commitment to end street homelessness/rough sleeping was an enduring feature of their term in office (for example SEU, 1998; DCLG, 2008). Of course, concerns about social exclusion predate New Labour, and a lack of meaningful involvement in many key areas of wider social life (for example, democratic and legal systems, the labour market, the welfare state, familial and (local) community networks) have long been identified as symptomatic of social exclusion (Commins, 1993). Previous research has also noted that homelessness rarely occurs in isolation and that many homeless people often carry with them a variety of other problems and experiences. It is clear that many homeless people experience ‘exclusion across more than one domain or dimension of disadvantage, resulting in severe negative consequences for [their] quality of life, well-being and future life chances’ (Levitas et al ., 2007: 9), and, as such, can be viewed as experiencing multiple and/or deep social exclusion. This situation has been recognised by Carter (2007) who, noting a lack of resources, rights and opportunities, adopts the phrase ‘multiple exclusion homelessness’ (MEH) as a shorthand term to characterise the reality of many homeless peoples’ lives.",

      "title": "Opacity in Transparency: A Decade of Photography and Political Communication in Argentina (1999-2010)",
      "abstract": "Introduction When used together, words communication and politics have multiple meanings, all of them related to different ideas of what communication and politics are, and what they imply when used together. As Sergio Caletti (2001) argues, usual approach to field in mass communication research gives an idea of politics as apparatus and communication as technology. Such an approach supports more instrumental notion of communication, conceived as strategy, and leads to two extreme positions (but based on same premises) about their incidence in political field. On one hand, some researchers emphasize 'spectacularization' of politics, which thus loses its rationality. On other hand, there are some authors who believe in potential of realizing Internet permanent assembly utopia. Adopting a different position, this work advocates idea of communication as condition of possibility for politics, in two ways: firstly, because politics entails a kind of social relationship essentially based on sharing of socially recognizable meanings, by means of word and action -namely, on communication. Secondly, because it is communication that allows the common as a constitutive attribute of politics (see Caletti, Op. Cit.). The public sphere articulates par excellence politics and communication. Although not everything in politics nor all in communication occur in public space, communication is embedded within politics just as much as politics is embedded in communication. This implies also that any society becomes visible for itself--namely, public--by dominant technical media that social relationships produced for its own representation. Based on these premises, general aim of this work was to analyze relationships between use of pictures in graphic political discourse and their contexts of meaning in last ten years in Argentina. The categories of analysis employed belong to Socio-semiotics theoretical and methodological frame. The empirical referent is constituted by a sample of different sorts of pictures used in graphic political discourse: * A selection of posters of electoral campaigns of period (for President in 1999 and 2007, and for legislative positions in 2005). The pictures used there are usually designed and chosen by campaign teams of each candidate as part of his/her electoral strategy. * A selection of photographs published in political news section of two largest circulated Argentinean newspapers (1999-2001, 2005 and 2007). In this case, pictures are a significant part of informative discourse of that media. The 'Illfare' State Trying to give a synthesis of Argentinean political life in last ten years is not easy. Maybe a fact is enough to show its complexity: there were seven Presidents of Republic between 1999-2005, even though Constitution establishes a four year term length. In other words, seven presidents where there should have been only three. The general background of decade was a widespread disappointment with democracy presumably caused by critical consequences of neoliberal politics and subsequent State retraction led by government of Carlos Menem and followed also by his successor Fernando de la Rua. An increasing discredit about ended in December 2001 riots, a period of civil uprising known as cacerolazo (pot banding), and was synthesized by slogan politicians go home. The institutional crisis caused dismission of De la Rua and a vertiginous succession of presidents until transitional period conducted by Eduardo Duhalde between 2002-2003. After 2003 elections, Nestor Kirchner assumed Presidency of Country, followed by his wife Cristina Fernandez (since 2007 and continues). It is necessary to mention that general disappointment with both politics and grown during decade of nineties clearly contrasted with previous moments of political life in Argentina. …",

This awareness, demonstrated by the popularity of such compilations as Mermet 1985, reedited in 1987 and 1989, exists not least because of the political implications of these socio-economic models.

Achievement is celebrated in many stories and narratives in which the protagonist prevails against the odds to achieve his or her mission. Thus achievement represents a wider set of cultural values that we encounter in families, organizations, or entire societies. An achievement ‘ethic’ (i.e. set of values, norms, and recipes) has its roots in religious and cultural practices which encourage and reward individual accomplishments, such as creating a fortune, becoming famous, moving up a career ladder, or generally being successful in sport, politics, business, the media, etc. These are seen as ‘good things’. Societies that emphasize and reward achievement tend to reinforce the view that success is all that matters in life. The non-achiever, the failed achiever, or the ‘has been’ can easily become an outsider in such a society.",

La recherche en sciences sociales montre que cette résistance serait davantage due à des conflits de valeurs, à des préoccupations quant à la répartition des avantages attendus et à un manque de confiance dans les institutions de gouvernance, telles que les autorités de réglementation et les organismes techniques consultatifs. En règle générale, les pays et les innovateurs devraient, dans toute la mesure du possible, tenir compte des préoccupations et des objectifs sociaux dès le début du processus de développement. Cette exigence n'est guère facile à respecter, mais de bonnes pratiques apparaissent, qui peuvent montrer la voie à suivre. Elles consistent notamment à intégrer les flux de financement des travaux en sciences sociales et humaines, avec les sciences naturelles et physique, en utilisant des formes participatives de prospective et d'évaluation de la technologie pour dessiner les perspectives souhaitables, et en engageant les parties prenantes à des processus de communication clairement liés à l'action publique.Tout cela contribuera à instaurer la confiance et la crédibilité des systèmes d'innovation.",

La integracion morfologica puede definirse como el grado de interrelacion en la expresion de diferentes caracteres. Los resultados sugieren altos grados de canalizacion para el neuro y basicraneo y menos canalizacion en las restantes estructuras, mas vinculadas con la masticacion. Por otro lado, la integracion morfologica es mas evidente en la fosa temporal y la articulacion temporo-mandibular.

      "title": "The Volatility of Collective Action: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Data",
      "abstract": "Collective action is volatile: characterized by swift, unexpected changes in intensity, target, and forms. We conduct a detailed exploration of four reasons that these changes occur. First, action is about identities which are fluid, contested, and multifaceted. As the content of groups’ identities change, so do the specific norms for the identities. Second, social movements adopt new tactics, or forms of collective action. Tactical changes may arise from changes in identity, but also changes in the target or opponent groups, and changes in the relationships with targets and with other actors. Factions or wings of a group in conflict may in turn form identities based on opposition or support for differing tactics. Third, social movements change because participant motivation ebbs, surges, and also changes in quality (e.g., becoming more subjectively autonomous, or self‐determined). Finally, political social change occurs within socio‐political structures; these structures implicate higher‐level norms, which both constrain and emerge from actions (e.g., state openness or repression). Our analysis presents idealized and descriptive models of these relationships, and a new model to examine tactical changes empirically, the DIME model. This model highlights that collective actors can D isidentify after failure (giving up and walking away); they can I nnovate, or try something new; and they can commit harder, convinced that they are right, with increased moral urgency ( M oralization) and redoubled efforts ( E nergization).",

The viability of a political public sphere depends on open access to information and the media plus freedom of expression to publicize opinions and engage in informed public deliberation. Without it, the political subject is reduced to a monolinguist who communicates desires, interests, and ideas to immediate surroundings but is denied an audience of interlocutors or a public capacitated to effectively respond. As Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann (1984) has instructed, fear of isolation may encourage public expressions of conformity but it also encourages seeking information that will confirm whether concerns, and quite possibly views, are shared. The possibility of a political public forming, discovering its interests, and expressing its opinions in order to authorize action is foreclosed without publicity.",

      "abstract": "In the life-cycle of community action, the act of planning – or the broader tendency to become future-orientated – is not automatic. The actions that communities take may be time-limited, restricted to a specific response to a particular set of circumstances: to crises and immediate needs, or the need to provide a specific service over the longer term. The prioritisation of planning requires community groups to recognise the longer-term pressures that are faced and the possibility that, through the articulation of collective vision and will, those pressures can be mitigated or opportunities grasped. It is also the case that time-limited mobilisations are easier to sustain than longterm efforts, and that such efforts need to be framed within structures of informal community activism or formal community governance. Communitarian planning of the type described in Chapter 1 needs to be embedded within community processes, although it can be seeded by the state, with a distinction then drawn between ‘communitarian planning as a by-product of community life (with its focus on social goods) and (implanted or hijacked) community planning as a product of the state's search for legitimacy – through extended interaction that delivers a less contentious vision of “what urban change should be like”’. The six case-studies contained in this Part of the book examine examples of both.",

      "abstract": "Health, like disability, is a multidimensional concept having many different meanings.The physical dimension of health is most often assessed in terms of pathology or problems with body structure and function.But health is not merely the absence of pathology or impairment, as ill health is seen as creating obstacles in undertaking desired activities.Functional status, such as in seeing, hearing, walking, communication, and cognition, is the mechanism through which pathology, or the absence of pathology, can impact all aspects of participation in society such as in education, employment, financial well-being, and civic engagement.The critical role of functioning in attaining full participation is highlighted in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD) (United Nations General Assembly 2006), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations General Assembly 2015), and the Americans With Disability Act (Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 1990).Each of these initiatives requires that limitations in functioning or disability be accommodated, often through removing environmental barriers and instituting facilitators, so that those with disability can fully participate in all aspects of society.Reliable, valid, and comparable data are needed to formulate policy to improve the lives of those with disability and to monitor whether full inclusion has been attained.The UNCRPD and the SDGs also specifically include requirements for such data collection and active monitoring.While the need for information on disability is well established, obtaining that information has been, and continues to be, challenging.One reason for this is the complex nature of the concept itself (Altman 2001).As defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, disability is an umbrella term that involves the interaction of the individual's functional abilities and the environment in which he or she lives (World Health Organization 2001).The nature of the interaction determines whether full participation in society is achieved.Thus, to fully understand disability, data are needed on the multiple component dimensions and the relationships among them.Functional difficulties can exist, for example, across a range of basic activity domains such as sensory, movement, cognition, and communication.Moreover, each of the domains can be characterized by a range of abilities.The environment is similarly broad, including both the physical or built environment as well as the social environment.In addition, while there is interest in the identification of those with disability and the characteristics of this",

This shared insight, operating in the works of critical theorists, linguistic anthropologists, and other scholars, illuminates the workings of state authority, capitalist reproduction, colonial domination, and other contexts of political oppression. Yet folk understandings of language, including those guiding mainstream institutions, continue to ignore language's pragmatic (context‐interacting) dimension in ways that seem to corroborate broader ideologies that normalize social domination. Examination of the relationship between language and ideology nonetheless highlights the indeterminacy of context and the deficiency of a priori assumptions of ideological domination. Because an utterance's meaning and performative effects are sensitive to local figurations of context, globally circulating models of political discourse, e.g. public deliberation, have different (often unintended) effects on the communities that integrate them.",

      "title": "Social Media as Tools of Exclusion in Academia?",
      "abstract": "Introduction I have this somewhat diffuse concern that at some point, I am in an appointment procedure ... and people say: ‘He has to ... be on social media, [and] have followers ..., because otherwise he can’t say anything about the field of research, otherwise he won’t identify with it … and we need a direct connection to legitimise our discipline in the population!’ And this is where I think: ‘For God’s sake! No, I really don’t want that.’ (Postdoc) Social media such as Facebook or Twitter have become an integral part of many people’s everyday lives and have introduced severe changes to the ways we communicate with each other and about ourselves. Presenting ourselves on social media and creating different online personas has become a normal practice (Vorderer et al. 270). While social media such as Facebook were at first mostly used to communicate with friends and family, they were soon also used for work-related communication (Cardon and Marshall). Later, professional networks such as LinkedIn, which focus on working relations and career management and special interest networks, such as the academic social networking sites (ASNS) Academia.edu and ResearchGate, catering specifically to academic needs, emerged. Even though social media have been around for more than 15 years now, academics in general and German academics in particular are rather reluctant users of these tools in a work-related context (König and Nentwich 175; Lo 155; Pscheida et al. 1). This is surprising as studies indicate that the presence and positive self-portrayal of researchers in social media as well as the distribution of articles via social networks such as Academia.edu or ResearchGate have a positive effect on the visibility of academics as well as the likelihood of their articles being read and cited (Eysenbach; Lo 192; Terras). Gruzd, Staves, and Wilk even assume that the presence in online media could become a relevant criterion in the allocation of scientific jobs. Science is a field where competition for long-term positions is high. In 2017, only about 17% of all scientific personnel in Germany had permanent positions, and of these 10% were professors (Federal Statistical Office 32). Having a professorship is therefore the best shot at obtaining a permanent position in the scientific field. However, the average vocational age is 40 (Zimmer et al. 40), which leads to a long phase of career-related uncertainty. Directing attention to yourself by acquiring knowledge in the use of social media for professional self-representation might offer a career advantage when trying to obtain a professorship. At the same time, social media, which have been praised for giving a voice to the unheard, become a tool for the exclusion of scholars who might not want or be able to use these tools as part of their work and career-related communication, and might remain unseen and unheard. The author obtained current data on this topic while working on a project on Mediated Scholarly Communication in Post-Normal and Traditional Science under the project lead of Corinna Lüthje. The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). In the project, German-speaking scholars were interviewed about their work-related media usage in qualitative interviews. Among them were users and non-users of social media. For this article, 16 interviews with communication scholars (three PhD students, six postdocs, seven professors) were chosen for a closer analysis, because of all the interviewees they described the (dis)advantages of career-related social media use in the most detail, giving the deepest insights into whether social media contribute to a social exclusion of academics or not. How to Define Social Exclusion (in Academia)? The term social exclusion describes a separation of individuals or groups from mainstream society (Walsh et al.). Exclusion is a practice which implies agency. It can be the result of the actions of others, but individuals can also exclude themselves by choosing not to be part of something, for example of social media and the communication taking part there (Atkinson 14). Exclusion is an everyday social practice, because wherever there is an in-group there will always be an out-group. This is what Bourdieu calls distinction. Symbols and behaviours of distinction both function as signs of demarcation and belonging (Bourdieu, Distinction). Those are not always explicitly communicated, but part of people’s behaviour. They act on a social sense by telling them how to behave appropriately in a certain situation. According to Bourdieu, the practical sense is part of the habitus (Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice). The habitus generates patterns of action that come naturally and do not have to be reflected by the actor, due to an implicit knowledge that is acquired during the course of (group-specific) socialisation. For scholars, the process of socialisation in an area of research involves the acquisition of a so-called disciplinary self-image, which is crucial to building a disciplinary identity. In every discipline it contains a dominant disciplinary self-image which defines the scientific perspectives, practices, and even media that are typically used and therefore belong to the mainstream of a discipline (Huber 24). Yet, there is a societal mainstream outside of science which scholars are a part of. Furthermore, they have been socialised into other groups as well. Therefore, the disciplinary mainstream and the habitus of its members can be impacted upon by the societal mainstream and other fields of society. For example, societally mainstream social media, such as Twitter or Facebook, focussing on establishing and sustaining social connections, might be used for scholarly communication just as well as ASNS. The latter cater to the needs of scholars to not just network with colleagues, but to upload academic articles, share and track them, and consume scholarly information (Meishar-Tal and Pieterse 17). Both can become part of the disciplinary mainstream of media usage. In order to define whether and how social media contribute to forms of social exclusion among communication scholars, it is helpful to first identify in how far their usage is part of the disciplinary mainstream, and what their including features are. In contrast to this, forms of exclusion will be analysed and discussed on the basis of qualitative interviews with communication scholars. Including Features of Social Media for Communication Scholars The interviews for this essay were first conducted in 2016. At that time all of the 16 communication scholars interviewed used at least one social medium such as ResearchGate (8), Academia.edu (8), Twitter (10), or Facebook (11) as part of their scientific workflow. By 2019, all of them had a ResearchGate and 11 an Academia.edu account, 13 were on Twitter and 13 on Facebook. This supports the notion of one of the professors, who said that he registered with ResearchGate in 2016 because \"everyone’s doing that now!” It also indicates that the work-related presence especially on ResearchGate, but also on other social media, is part of the disciplinary mainstream of communication science. The interviewees figured that the social media they used helped them to increase their visibility in their own community through promoting their work and networking. They also mentioned that they were helpful to keep up to date on the newest articles and on what was happening in communication science in general. The usage of ResearchGate and Academia.edu focussed on publications. Here the scholars could, as one professor put it, access articles that were not available via their university libraries, as well as “previously unpublished articles”. They also liked that they could see \"what other scientists are working on\" (professor) and were informed via e-mail \"when someone publishes a new publication\" (PhD student). The interviewees saw clear advantages to their registration with the ASNS, because they felt that they became \"much more visible and present\" (postdoc) in the scientific community. Seven of the communication scholars (two PhD students, three postdocs, two professors) shared their publications on ResearchGate and Academia.edu. Two described doing cross-network promotion, where they would write a post about their publications on Twitter or Facebook that linked to the full article on Academia.edu or ResearchGate. The usage of Twitter and especially Facebook focussed a lot more on accessing discipline-related information and social networking. The communication scholars mentioned that various sections and working groups of professional organisations in their research field had accounts on Facebook, where they would post news. A postdoc said that she was on Facebook \"because I get a lot of information from certain scientists that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise\". Several interviewees pointed out that Twitter is \"a place where you can find professional networks, become a part of them or create them yourself\" (professor). On Twitter the interviewees explained that they were rather making new connections. Facebook was used to maintain and intensify existing professional relationships. They applied it to communicate with their local networks at their institute, just as well as for international communication. A postdoc and a professor both mentioned that they perceived that Scandinavian or US-American colleagues were easier to contact via Facebook than via any other medium. One professor described how he used Facebook at international conferences to arrange meetings with people he knew and wanted to meet. But to him Facebook also catered to accessing more personal information about his colleagues, thus creating a new \"mixture of professional respect for the work of other scientists and personal relationships\", which resulted in a \"new kind of friendship\". Excluding Features of Social Media for Communication Scholars While everyone may create an Academia.edu, Facebook, or Twitter account, ResearchGate is already an exclusive network in itself, as only people working in a scientific field are allowed to join. In 2016, eight of the interviewees and in 2019 all of them had signed up to ResearchGate. So at least among the communication scholars, this did not seem to be an excluding factor. More of an issue was for one of the postdocs that she did not have the copyright to upload her published articles on the ASNS and therefore refrained from uploading them. Interestingly enough, this did not seem to worry any of the other interviewees, and concerns were mostly voiced in relation to the societal mainstream social media. Although all of the interviewees had an account with at least one social medium, three of them described that they did not use or had withdrawn from using Facebook and Twitter. For one professor and one PhD student this had to do with the privacy and data security issues of these networks. The PhD student said that she did not want to be reminded of what she “tweeted maybe 10 years ago somewhere”, and also considered tweeting to be irrelevant in her community. To her, important scientific findings would rather be presented in front of a professional audience and not so much to the “general public”, which she felt was mostly addressed on social media. The professor mentioned that she had been on Facebook since she was a postdoc, but decided to stop using the service when it introduced new rules on data security. On one hand she saw the “benefits” of the network to “stay informed about what is happening in the community”, and especially “in regards to the promotion of young researchers, since some of the junior research groups are very active there”. On the other she found it problematic for her own time management and said that she received a lot of the posted information via e-mail as well. A postdoc mentioned that he had a Facebook account to stay in contact with young scholars he met at a networking event, but never used it. He would rather connect with his colleagues in person at conferences. He felt people would just use social media to “show off what they do and how awesome it is”, which he did not understand. He mentioned that if this “is how you do it now … I don't think this is for me.” Another professor described that Facebook \"is the channel for German-speaking science to generate social traffic”, but that he did not like to use it, because “there is so much nonsense ... . It’s just not fun. Twitter is more fun, but the effect is much smaller\", as bigger target groups could be reached via Facebook. The majority of the interviewees did not use mainstream social media because they were intrinsically motivated. They rather did it because they felt that it was expected of them to be there, and that it was important for their career to be visible there. Many were worried that they would miss out on opportunities to promote themselves, network, and receive information if they did not use Twitter or Facebook. One of the postdocs mentioned, for example, that she was not a fan of Twitter and would often not know what to write, but that the professor she worked for had told her she needed to tweet regularly. But she did see the benefits as she said that she had underestimated the effect of this at first: “I think, if you want to keep up, then you have to do that, because people don’t notice you.” This also indicates a disciplinary mainstream of social media usage. Conclusion The interviews indicate that the usage of ResearchGate in particular, but also of Academia.edu and of the societal mainstream social media platforms Twitter and Facebook has become part of the disciplinary mainstream of communication science and the habitus of many of its members. ResearchGate mainly targets people working in the scientific field, while excluding everyone else. Its focus on publication sharing makes the network very attractive among its main target group, and serves at the same time as a symbol of distinction from other groups (Bourdieu, Distinction). Yet it also raises copyright issues, which led at least one of the participants to refrain from using this option. The societal mainstream social media Twitter and Facebook, on the other hand, have a broader reach and were more often used by the interviewees for social networking purposes than the ASNS. The interviewees emphasised the benefits of Twitter and Facebook for exchanging information and connecting with others. Factors that led the communication scholars to refrain from using the networks, and thus were excluding factors, were data security and privacy concerns; disliking that the networks were used to “show off”; as well as considering Twitter and Facebook as unfit for addressing the scholarly target group properly. The last statement on the target group, which was made by a PhD student, does not seem to represent the mainstream of the communication scholars interviewed, however. Many of them were using Twitter and Facebook for scholarly communication and rather seemed to find them advantageous. Still, this perception of the disciplinary mainstream led to her not using them for work-related purposes, and excluding her from their advantages. Even though, as one professor described it, a lot of information shared via Facebook is often spread through other communication channels as well, some can only be received via the networks. Although social media are mostly just a substitute for face-to-face communication, by not using them scholars will miss out on the possibilities of creating the “new kind of friendship” another professor mentioned, where professional and personal relations mix. The results of this study show that social media use is advantageous for academics as they offer possibilities to access exclusive information, form new kinds of relations, as well as promote oneself and one’s publications. At the same time, those not using these social media are excluded and might experience career-related disadvantages. As described in the introduction, academia is a competitive environment where many people try to obtain a few permanent positions. By default, this leads to processes of exclusion rather than integration. Any means to stand out from competitors are welcome to emerging scholars, and a career-related advantage will be used. If the growth in the number of communication scholars in the sample signing up to social networks between 2016 to 2019 is any indication, it is likely that the networks have not yet reached their full potential as tools for career advancement among scientific communities, and will become more important in the future. Now one could argue that the communication scholars who were interviewed for this essay are a special case, because they might use social media more actively than other scholars due to their area of research. Though this might be true, studies of other scholarly fields show that social media are being applied just the same (though maybe less extensively), and that they are used to establish cooperations and increase the amount of people reading and citing their publications (Eysenbach; Lo 192; Terras). The question is whether researchers will be able to avoid using social media when striving for a career in science in the future, which can only be answered by further research on the topic.

Understanding how teachers are affected by globalization, and what role they play in the process of institutional change, requires further theoretical elaboration of (a) the relationship between culture and institutions; (b) the “institutional work” teachers do to transmit or disrupt institutional patterns; and (c) how “institutional logics” may conflict or align with broader cultural systems of meaning, that is, “cultural logics.” Institutional logics are diffused globally across multiple levels, and resonance between national cultural logics and globally diffusing institutional logics aids their diffusion. Teachers, individually and collectively, may advocate for new institutional logics, and thus engage in institutional change, but their efficacy to mobilize on a national scale is often limited. The evolution of technologically supported, dense communication networks affords teachers opportunities to elaborate on diffusing institutional logics.",

Worldwide the manpower constituting an organization is becoming multi cultural. Organizations at times have less than 15% of its employees from the home culture (Ray, 1998). Understanding of different cultures has become a necessity for anyone wanting to conduct business successfully in this global scenario. Managers, besides managing employees, are expected to deal with all kinds of challenges emanating from cross cultural differences. He must understand the laws, customs, and business practices of many countries and be able to communicate with people who speak other languages. The key to managerial efficiency in this modern environment is to have cross-cultural communication competency that includes understanding people, their perceptions, their backgrounds, values etc. in order to get the best out of a multicultural team. Misunderstandings Differences in goals, customs, behavior, values and thought patterns have led to many faux-pas especially in a diverse workforce with increasing numbers of expatriate workers not familiar with the host culture, its language, and communication systems in their intercultural experience (Chen& Starosta, 1998). Some are not serious, while others result in organizational and personal tragedies and affect company presidents and ambassadors, as well as tourists. Using the 2001 accident involving the sinking of the Ehime Maru, a Japanese fisheries high school training boat, Lingley (2006) highlights how differing cultural norms and values surrounding apologies in America and Japan caused serious intercultural communication problems. Gudykunst & Nishida (1994) termed this as the violations of expectations in a communication, causing an arousal in either or both interlocutors. Intercultural Competence Model Byram (1997) proposes a model of intercultural communicative competence which involves four elements: linguistic competence, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence and intercultural competence for interacting successfully with someone from a different culture. Competent communicators are able to identify their goals, assess the resources necessary to obtain those goals, accurately predict the other communicator's responses, choose workable communication strategies, enact those communication strategies, and, finally, accurately assess the results of the interaction (Parks & Kim, 2008).Thus, communicators who do these activities effectively and appropriately, are considered competent communicators. The final component-skill-of ICC competence reflects the needed behaviors to interact appropriately and effectively with members of different cultures. Research has discovered several behaviors that are positively associated with ICC competence: being mindful (Gudykunst, Nishida & Chua, 1986), intercultural adroitness (Chen & Starosta, 1996), interaction involvement (Cegala, 1984), recognition of nonverbal messages (Anderson, 1994), appropriate self-disclosure (Li, 1999), behavioral flexibility (Bochner & Kelly, 1974), interaction management (Wiemann, 1977), identity maintenance (Ting-Toomey, 1994), uncertainty reduction strategies (Sanders, Wiseman & Matz, 1991), appropriate display of respect (Ruben, 1976), immediacy skills (Benson, 1978), ability to establish interpersonal relationships (Hammer, 1987), and expressing clarity and face support (Kim, 1993). These behaviors reflect the ability to communicate in an adaptive, flexible, and supportive manner. Towards Better Intercultural Understanding Within the context of the global workplace, intercultural communication at its foundation aims to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate (verbally and non-verbally) with each other, manage, work together, approach deadlines, negotiate, meet, greet, and build relationships and more. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Frame disputes refer to differences of opinion or preference regarding claims associated with framing activities that social movement actors fashion. Frame disputes are a pervasive dynamic within social movements, one of several contested discursive processes within the movement arena (Benford &amp; Snow 2000). The concept derives from Erving Goffman's observations in Frame Analysis that interpretations of what's going on in a particular circumstance are subject to disagreement. On such occasions “reality” must be negotiated. In the context of social movements, frame disputes erupt within a movement organization ( intra organizational dispute) and/or between representatives of two or more SMOs within a social movement ( inter organizational dispute). Frame disputes in the wider political arena, such as those that often arise between social movements and their opponents (e.g., countermovements, targets of change, media, etc.), have been referred to as “framing contests” (Ryan 1991). The focus of this entry is on interpretive and discursive disagreements that occur within a social movement.",

      "title": "Introducing New Technology into Social Agencies: The Case of Behavior Modification",
      "abstract": "Abstract There seems to be a pattern in the introduction of new practice concepts into social work practice (Carter and Stuart, 1970). First, a few social workers introduce the ideas into practice and the social work literature. As the ideas spread, others in the field may inspect the ideas, often with a negative bias, and achieve consensus in rejecting the new and restating their allegiance to the established. As the number of people who experiment with the approach increase, some in the field begin to rephrase their evaluation in terms of the ideas having some, but limited, applications (Bruck, 1968). Or sometimes, the ideas may be viewed as all right, but nothing really new. Subsequently, the field may bifurcate (as it did in the functional-diagnostic schism) or—as seems to be happening in the case of the introduction of behavior modification—the concepts slowly begin to be infused into the mainstream of social work practice.",

      "abstract": "This is the second part of a pair of special issues dedicated to the area of Intelligence and Interaction in Community-based Systems. The first of these special issues(Stathis and Purcell, 2002) addressed the range of spontaneous interactions that may form part of a set of concentric patterns of personal, familial, social and civic circles. The focus then was on the needs of physically co-located communities, those lay people who may live next door, frequent the local pub, send their children to the same school, or bump into each other intermittently at meetings of local societies or professional associations. This second part of the special issues still keeps the notion of local community in the physical neighbourhood but here the attention is diverted to the kind of relationships that the members of such a community may be establishing with other communities, whether local or global, real or virtual, more simple or more complex. Such relationships can vary enormously in the manner, in which, interactions can be structured and organised. It is this potential development that orients this part of the special issue towards those more social activities that are, by their nature, quite structured and which involve citizen interactions in more formal settings, such as the buying and selling of goods, learning in a local setting, sharing knowledge at work, and accessing local cultural resources in order to support the needs of a modern community's lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "The social sciences play a pivotal role in the accomplishment of developmental objectives by providing the best of what society needs in terms of specialists in the different fields and from different perspectives in addition to the most important scientific and applied research without which it will be difficult to fulfill economic and social advances that go with the social and intellectual trends. Added to this, these objectives won’t be fully achieved without interaction among the individuals on the one hand, and society on the other. Therefore, it is impossible to isolate the university from society or any development projects, and any imbalance in this context will lead to the disintegration of the structure of society as a whole. In this paper, we will hence, try to explore the prominent role of the social sciences with their different disciplines in achieving social balance, and among the most pertinent questions that will be raised are the following: Did the Algerian society get rid of slums by adopting developmental schemes? And what is the extent of social thinking in developmental projects?",

Factions occur when a subset of organizational members begin to develop a distinct collective identity that is at least partially at odds with other members. Factionalism refers to this conflict between an organizational faction and other members, or between competing organizational factions. Strictly speaking, factionalism refers to intra‐organizational conflict. However, many social movement scholars have used the concept of factionalism to understand interorganizational conflict within a broader social movement. In other words, we can use the language of factions to understand a wider range of phenomena, including how different branches of a social movement form and interact. Scholars have paid attention to the ways factions originate, to how they disperse or strengthen over time, to the different outcomes of factionalism, and to the consequences of factionalism for social movements generally.",

Additionally, these problems comprise a wide range of various possible approaches which, because of their imponderability, are not easy to measure. Some of them may refer to education, work, health, as well as income, living standards, etc. The reason for all these planes and dimensions lies in certain conditionings modified complementarily by peculiar circumstances. Thus, the aim of the paper is to show the defined phenomena which may remain either in the input area of the problem of social inequalities or in the output circle referring to the results or definite effects of peculiar inequalities, e.g. differentiation. This differentiation, in turn, will concern the interregional relationships within one state, i.e. the provinces (NUTS 2 level) will be compared to one another and analyzed.",

When administrators act in a manner which is considered to be grossly unethical, debate is initiated regarding the appropriate standards to be applied for ethical behavior. However, gross indiscretions, violation of basic moral principles which state that individuals should not lie, cheat or steal, actually constitute a small proportion of ethical questions raised by the daily activities of administrators (Kaplan, 1963; Lilla, 1981). Concern for sensational ethical violations, when they arise, draws attention away from the more significant ethical dilemmas which occur on a day-to-day basisdilemmas so indistinct that many administrators sense a conflict but are uncertain as to its cause. The source and dimensions of day-to-day dilemmas are often unclear. These day-to-day ethical dilemmas are an inevitable outcome of the nature of American public administration.

      "abstract": "Information processing and communication technologies are developing so rapidly today that it can said that there is a communication technology explosion. The new technologies widen the world for the individuals to reach other human beings regardless of where they are on the globe. Various groups of people can come together according to their private or business interests, forming a virtual community. In the generation and operation of these communities, cooperation and collaboration have significant role. On the other hand, these technologies deeply modify traditional forms of social connections, communication, and cultural habits as well. These modifications can be observed in particular in hierarchies, social rules, norms, conventions, familiarity, and reputation. A very important element of human contacts is trust. In a networked society, trust is the atmosphere, the medium in which actors are moving (Castelfranchi & Tan, 2001). Trust can bridge cultural, geographical, and organizational distances of members. Trust is the basis of cooperation, the normal behavior of the human being in the society. As the rate of cooperation is increasing in all fields of life, the importance of trust is evolving even faster. In this new communication environment new methods and techniques of trust building have to be developed, as the conventional rules of face-to-face approach cannot be applied. According to different experiments, the level of trust is highly influenced by the way/mode of communication and by the duration of contact.

      "abstract": "There are empirical grounds for supporting unrestrained, globalized cooperative human measures as being beneficial to the international standard of living. A high extent of interconnectedness on multiple levels has already been realized in transportation systems, energy distribution channels, and communication networks. However, in periods of societal transition, as can be the case under rapid technology development, tensions may arise if disparities in wealth, power, or infrastructure access widen extensively. When subgroups of the citizenry that do not sufficiently partake in progress feel left behind or disenfranchised, their triggering of pull-back phenomena is very common. The pattern is repetitive: disparities not remedied on a lower scale impair integration on a larger scale. Equitable infrastructure maintenance and development, regionally, nationally, and globally, is a powerful policy tool for preempting pull-backs – especially if it is applied to communities with weak support or high inequality. The characteristics of the modern world demand far-reaching collaborations. Only universal interdependence, built from the roots up, can enable progress and social justice.",

      "abstract": "The perennial problem of identifying who does and who should make decisions in society is not made easier by presenting it to engineers in terms of 'community directions' especially in an environmental context. This framework requires examination of the concept of community, its countervailing components and exploration of the practical limits of community governance. A further difficulty beyond these structural limitations in decision making is whether appropriate and consistent choices of community directions can be made when agreed goals, aspirations and values are only articulated at a high level of generality. Exogenous environmental factors further complicate these difficulties of definition and process. Such factors include not only physical and social (including economic) components but also the technological milieu of the community. In this milieu engineers, proceeding linearly to their own goals in their own closed frames of reference, continuously change the directions of wider communities in ways quite unforeseen by them or the community in which they are embedded. Sometimes other elements of the community see that these changes may not lead to community goals as they perceive them. Occasionally they check the course of the linear engineer. However in the end there seems to be a large stochastic element in setting longer term community directions which remain indeterminant under present processes of governance.",

The constraints on possible patterns in CS are largely under innately based controls. These constraints are presented here in a model of intrasentential CS, and their validity is tested against findings of CS practices in a number of communities; all options can be accounted for under the model. Thus the options for CS structures seem universally set; but community-specific or group-specific social forces may determine which permissible patterns are preferred . In addition, micro-level, discourse-based factors may prompt individuals to produce certain CS structures. A second model of the social motivations for CS helps explain both the macro- and micro-level preferences. (Bilingualism, codeswitching, language contact, socio-pragmatics)",

Furthermore, in times of social change and economic uncertainty, clients often feel discouraged, despondent, and hopeless about their futures. The encreasing complexity of client needs and career counseling interventions have rendered inadquate, and simplistic approaches to resolving career issues. Although traditional approaches still may play a role in career planning, additional emphasis must be placed on other issues: how self-concept is implemented (Super, 1990), personal adaptability (Super, 1985), and personal meaning-making (Miller-Tiedeman & Tiedeman, 1990). Career counseling should also help clients achieve independence rather than dependence. Such factors necessitate a different vision of the counseling process.",

      "title": "When Holding in Prevents From Reaching Out: Emotion Suppression and Social Support-Seeking in Multicultural Groups",
      "abstract": "Members of multicultural groups benefit from developing diverse social support networks. Engaging openly with people who have a different worldview (i.e., given by a different cultural background) broadens one's cognitive horizons, facilitates one's adaptation to new contexts, decreases stereotyping and discrimination and generally improves individual and group performance. However, if this social connection is hindered (either by limiting the number of people one reaches out to or in terms of preferring to connect to similar others), then the diversity advantage is lost – both for the individuals and for the groups. Through two case studies of professional groups with varying cultural diversity (moderate and super-diverse), we investigate the evolution of their members' social support networks (i.e., to what extent and to whom they reach out for support) depending on (1) individuals' habitual emotion suppression and (2) cultural orientation on the individualism-collectivism dimension. Results show that individualistic cultures suffer a double-whammy: when suppressing, their members seek less support (i.e., don't reach out so much to ask for support) and tend to seek culturally similar others for it when they do. Suppressing collectivists are less affected in absolute levels of connectedness, but still prefer culturally similar others as sources of support. Our study offers an emotion-based view of why people stick together with similar others in diverse groups and how learning to better cope with emotions can make us more open-minded towards diversity in professional settings.",

      "title": "Human Cooperation and the Crises of Climate Change, COVID-19, and Misinformation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Contemporary society is facing many pressing challenges, including climate change, Covid-19, and misinformation. Here we illustrate how these three crises are each social dilemmas, characterized by a conflict between short-term self-interest and longer-term collective interest. The climate crisis requires paying costs today to benefit distant others in the future. The Covid-19 crisis requires the less vulnerable to pay costs to benefit the more vulnerable, in the face of great uncertainty. The misinformation crisis requires investing effort to assess truth, as well as resisting the temptation to spread attractive falsehoods. Addressing these crises therefore requires understanding human cooperation. To that end, we present (i) a brief overview of mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation, including mechanisms based on similarity (i.e., kinship, spatial selection, and group selection) and those based on interaction (i.e., direct reciprocity, reputation); (ii) a detailed discussion of how reputation can incentivize cooperation via conditional cooperation and signaling; and (iii) a review of social preferences that undergird the proximate psychology of cooperation, including positive regard for others (i.e., a cooperative orientation to others in general), parochialism (i.e., a cooperative orientation to ingroups, sometimes at a cost to outgroups or the collective as a whole), and egalitarianism (i.e., an orientation that seeks to reduce absolute differences in outcomes for self and others). We then discuss each of the three focal crises facing our society through the lens of cooperation, emphasizing how insights from cooperation research can inform efforts to address these crises.",

      "title": "Community Interpreting",
      "abstract": "Abstract Community interpreting (CI) refers to interpreting in public service institutions and differs from other types of interpreting in a number of aspects (e.g., mode of delivery, interaction situation, level of formality/orality present, level of interpreter involvement, status and roles of the participants, level of professionalization, and power asymmetries) (Hale, 2007, p. 31). Compared to conference interpreting, which has achieved the highest level of professionalization within the interpreting world since the 1950s (Pöchhacker, 2004, p. 29), CI is sometimes described as “the poor relation” (Mason, 2001, p. i), a phrase which reflects the status CI has had in the interpreting community until recently. In spite of its low prestige, CI can be said to be one of the most common and oldest types of interpreting (Roberts, 2002, p. 157). Through the centuries, interpreters have had to bridge communication barriers between speakers of different languages and cultures. In interpreting studies (IS), CI has long been neglected. Throughout the 1990s it has gradually become an accepted field of research (Pöchhacker, 2004, pp. 28–9). With respect to practice and training though, its professionalization and acceptance among practitioners, clients, and the public still varies, with a high level of service provision in only a few pioneer countries and the majority of countries lagging behind. This entry will provide an overview of different aspects of CI, the state of training and CI research. It attempts to address both spoken and signed language (SL) interpreting, specifically highlighting aspects in which SL, which enjoys a higher degree of professionalization, differs from spoken‐language interpreting.",

      "title": "Learning from regulatory failure: How Ostrom’s restorative justice design principle helps naïve groups create wiser enforcement systems to overcome the tragedy of the commons",
      "abstract": "Rule enforcement is critical in democratic, self-governing societies. Many political disputes occur when citizens do not understand the fundamental rationales for enforcement (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). We examined how naïve groups learn and develop wise enforcement systems. Based on theories from behavioral economics, political science, psychology, and education, we predicted that groups need to experience failure of an enforcement system, but be guided on restorative justice principles to collectively learn from this failure. Undergraduate students ( N = 288) from a Midwestern U.S. metropolitan university self-governed a simulated common-pool resource with real financial payoffs. Groups began with one of three conditions designed to create different experiences with enforcement and regulatory failure: (a) no enforcement (no communication or peer sanctioning), (b) lax enforcement (communication with peer-sanctioning), or (c) regulatory abuse (peer sanctioning without communication). Half then received facilitated guidance on restorative justice principles (e.g., discuss whether/why to use sanctions). To examine cooperation, we measured how well participants maintained the resource. To examine group learning, we created a novel coding system, which tracked groups’ constitutional decisions about conservation agreements and enforcement, conceptual understanding, and the enforcement systems they created. The no-enforcement and lax-enforcement conditions quickly yielded moderate cooperation via voluntary agreements. However, such agreements prevented groups from discovering how and why to use enforcement (peer sanctioning) to improve performance. Initial exposure to regulatory failure had different effects depending on facilitation. Unfacilitated groups fixated on initial misconceptions, causing them to abandon or create less sophisticated enforcement systems, hindering cooperation. Facilitated groups learned from prior failure—discovering principles of wise enforcement (e.g., collective efficiency, self-restraint)—and created more sophisticated enforcement systems (e.g., coordinated sanctions) that improved cooperation. Guidance on restorative justice principles and experience with regulatory abuse may be necessary preconditions for naïve individuals to understand and develop wiser collective enforcement systems.",

      "title": "YOUTH DISCOURSE IN MULTILINGUAL MAURITIUS: THE PRAGMATIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SWEARING IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGE",
      "abstract": "Drawing from Dewaele (2010, 2013), this paper seeks to analyse the socio-pragmatics of swearing in face-to-face multilingual conversational encounters and argues that the conversational locus (Auer, 1984) of playfulness favours, amongst others, the co-occurrence of slang and code-switching (CS). Defined by Eble (1996: 11) as an \"ever changing set of colloquial words and phrases that speakers use to establish or reinforce social identity or cohesiveness within a group or with a trend or fashion in society at large\", slang is more often than not associated with the speech of youngsters seeking to set up the linguistic boundaries of their in-group. Viewed as a global phenomenon which is transposed differently in local contexts by young people hailing from different social, cultural and linguistic backgrounds —including, as Zimmerman (2009: 121) notes, dialectal and sociolectal backgrounds — it acts as a marker of symbolic \"desire and consciousness of youth alterity\". Such a situation can be endowed with further sociolinguistic complexity in multilingual situations such as Mauritius where the wide range of available languages endows speakers with an equally fertile repertoire of swear words derived from diverse sources.In keeping with the above, this paper focuses on a series of multi-party recordings carried out between the months of October 2011 and March 2012 and analyses the ways in which the usage of swear words in multilingual contexts can act not just as a reflection of speakers' communicative competence but also as an externalisation of their dynamism and creativity. The use of swear words in conjunction with CS is, thus, viewed as being a pragmatically consequential conversational act. Such linguistic versatility appears to be, therefore, indexical of a reflexive position that youngsters orient themselves to by allowing their linguistic output to be seen as a performance, \"involv[ing] on the part of the performer an assumption of accountability to an audience for the way in which communication is carried out, above and beyond its referential content\" (Bauman, 1975: 293).",

However, behavioural research indicates these inter-individual differences can have significant effects on the dynamics of collective action. The papers contributed to this theme issue evaluate how individual differences affect the propensity to cooperate, and how they can catalyse others’ likelihood of cooperation (e.g. via leadership). Many of the papers emphasize the relationship between individual decisions and socio-ecological context, particularly the effect of group size. All together, the papers in this theme issue provide a more complete picture of collective action, by embracing the reality of inter-individual variation and its multiple roles in the success or failure of collective action.",

Johan Galtung (1969) also refers to it as social injustice and it is characterised by unequal access to education, health, water, food, shelter and other basic services. SV manifests itself through different forms of exclusion supported through both public and private institutions. Without support to address economic and educational opportunities, Zimbabwean youth continue to experience SV and high levels of social inequality (Chimucheka, 2012). Conflict transformation (CT) can help address SV since it provides processes and ways to build something desired thus altering the manifestation of the conflict (Waldman, 2009). CT involves action between parties that leads to both social change and justice (M. Evans, 2016). Social entrepreneurship (SE) can be used as a CT tool because it (i) identifies an unjust equilibrium that perpetuates exclusion and marginalisation, (ii) identifies opportunities and innovatively challenges the status quo to add social value and (iii) provides a better future for the marginalised communities through creating a new and stable alternative equilibrium (Baporikar, 2016). This chapter discusses the SV transformation model which the author tested to address the disparities faced by youth in an urban area in Zimbabwe. The action research, which took place between January and May 2017, was carried out in combination with capacity building, social support systems and community participation to address some of the SV indicators prevalent in the community. Whilst SE showed great potential in tackling SV in the community study, findings also reveal contestations between theory and practice. Some of the barriers identified in the field include the community’s failure to self-organise, lack of financial resources and buy-in from the local government. Future research could test the model in multiple settings and over longer periods to see its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Some risk-related incidents have far-reaching societal impacts while others gradually fade from public attention and memory. These societal impacts include direct policy responses such as stricter regulation of the relevant risk and also “significant indirect impacts such as liability, insurance costs, loss of confidence in institutions, stigmatization, or alienation from community affairs” (Kasperson 1992, p. 158). Paradoxically, the magnitude of such societal impacts often has little to do with the technically assessed magnitude of the actual risks involved. Attempts to explain this puzzle resulted in the development of the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) (Kasperson, Renn, Slovic et al. 1988).",

      "abstract": "As a concept and professional practice, public affairs is both a generic term for the trends and conditions that define and result from socioeconomic, sociopolitical processes, and the executive management function that works to position each organization comfortably in its non‐marketplace context. Taking the typical view of public affairs in the United States, Madden (2005, 665) defined it as “the management function responsible for interpreting an organization's external environment, or in the case of a corporation, its noncommercial environment, and managing an effective and appropriate response to that environment.” Its primary connection with society centers on factors in the public policy (non‐marketplace) arena that can lead government to influence (support or oppose) management decisions and organizational operations and policies (→ Corporate Communication; Corporate Reputation; Organizational Communication; Organizational Image). In the United Kingdom, the emphasis “on managing potentially complex relationships and issues that may ultimately affect the destiny of organisations … led many organisations to recognize the strategic importance of the public affairs function” (Harris &amp; Moss 2001, 6).",

      "title": "Work, recognition and the market",
      "abstract": "Ongoing debates about the (im)proper remuneration of those working in the financial services sector, in the light of the recession, reveal not simply deep-rooted intuitions about the comparative fairness of monetary rewards for different kinds of labour. They also invoke more amorphous but no less real ideals – about the social contribution of various kinds of work (‘bankers are only in it for themselves’) and the respect they receive from the wider society; the way work enables or disables us from meeting our obligations to fellow citizens (‘bankers got us into this mess in the first place’); the comparative merits of regarding work as a competitive domain (which financial markets perhaps exemplify) as opposed to a co-operative one, generating social solidarity; and beyond that an older notion, rather eclipsed by neo-liberalism, that work might be seen as a fundamentally expressive, dignified activity. Beyond money and consumables, then, work produces, or fails to produce, a range of social goods. And workers – highly unpaid, low paid and unpaid (such as parents) – can be recognised for the way in which they produce social goods and realise core values. Conversely, of course, our world of values structures the way different forms of work are perceived and regarded. Since human beings seem almost limitlessly hungry for honour (Brennan and Pettit, 2004) such recognition is as important as monetary reward: it is a crucial source of self-respect and self-esteem. Our aim in this special issue of Renewal is to reflect upon the ways in which different forms of work are recognised, misrecognised or under-recognised for the wider set goods they produce in the contemporary market, and to connect this to debates about the comparative fairness of remuneration.",

      "title": "Sustainable practice: an ontological politics",
      "abstract": "Background: We have a complex and dynamic predicament. Sustainability is often offered as part of the resolution of our predicament. There is though no direct path to resolving issues to do with sustainability for the direct paths often have unintended consequences. Engineers' traditional practice of rationalisation and reduction (for example as embodied in the notion of technical efficiency at minimum cost) is a form of direct response aiming to simplify complex problems to solve them. This rationalising and reducing though has been extremely useful in solving problems of a certain type but now we are in a complex and dynamic predicament and continuing these approaches (in isolation) will exacerbate rather than help to ameliorate. Peoples realities and conceptions are different as a result of their different genetics, histories, experiences, cultures, education, roles etc. and this applies particularly to conceptions of sustainability: there are no or few attempts at shared understanding. Further people's understandings and ways of responding are not static rather their behaviour emerges within context. Reality also includes 'things' both material and conceptual and these 'things' are both mutable and mobile. Some ideas, especially those at a 'system' level are only understood via instruments and the data that is produced - this puts these ideas at a distance - they are more remote to our senses. In the light of all the above, achieving consensus towards meaningful solutions in relation to sustainability or the resolution of our predicament is difficult and requires different practices to those normally used by engineering practitioners. For engineers technology and the technical will be a major part of our solutions but if we are not able to engage at a level that takes into account the complexities and dynamics then we will be doomed to being part of the problem. This paper argues that ontological politics is a useful conception to aid in the navigation of the issue of sustainability. Further the notion of 'practice' is irreducible (it is a personalised and professionalised set of knowledge, skills and attributes). Sustainable practice is a potentially transforming concept. Using this practice we will engage with other disciplines, recognise the complexity and dynamics of our predicament and be empathetic with other peoples' complexities in the process of adapting with our context towards more sustainable futures. Purpose: To continue the re-thinking of the nature of engineering and its' practices in adapting with the ongoing challenges of creating more sustainable futures - in this paper attention is directed to the concept of 'ontological politics. Design/Method: The methods used were desk research of context and philosophy, particularly Mol and Carolan's 'ontological politics', and Latour's metaphysics as described by Harman (2009) as well as, experiences using action research - a form of ontological politics, including the preparation and presentation of these a series of papers exposing these ideas at conferences like this one. Results: Further exploration of this stream of ideas and a paper that is prospective in nature. Conclusions: This is an ongoing study and informing of practice. 'ontological politics' is a useful construct for the work of engineers in relation to adapting with emerging sustainable futures.",

Les divergences dans leurs manières d’appréhender l’activité sportive et de se comporter sont telles que leur commune passion pour le ballon rond ne saurait préserver les équipes des rapports conflictuels. Au contraire comme le montre Camille Martin, les rapports entre personnes socialement très distantes multiplient les occasions de développement de tensions, lesquelles reflètent en fait les antagonismes qui traversent la société. Toutefois, des contacts répétés, orientés autour d’objectifs communs mènent à des rapprochements entre joueuses et à une dédramatisation par l’humour des conflits sociaux. Mais ces rapprochements exigent souvent des joueuses les plus dominées qu’elles adaptent leur comportement à la culture plus légitime de leurs partenaires.",

      "title": "Evolution of prosocial behavior in multilayer populations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human societies include many types of social relationships. Friends, family, business colleagues, online contacts, and religious groups, for example, can all contribute to an individual's social life. Individuals may behave differently in different domains, but their success in one domain may nonetheless engender success in another. The complexity caused by distinct, but coupled, arenas of social interaction may be a key driver of prosocial or selfish behavior in societies. Here, we study this problem using multilayer networks to model a population with multiple domains of social interactions. An individual can appear in multiple different layers, each with separate behaviors and environments. We provide mathematical results on the resulting behavioral dynamics, for any multilayer structure. Across a diverse space of structures, we find that coupling between layers tends to promote prosocial behavior. In fact, even if prosociality is disfavored in each layer alone, multilayer coupling can promote its proliferation in all layers simultaneously. We apply these techniques to six real-world multilayer social networks, ranging from the networks of socio-emotional and professional relationships in a Zambian community, to the networks of online and offline relationships within an academic University. Our results suggest that coupling between distinct domains of social interaction is critical for the spread of prosociality in human societies.",

      "abstract": "Relations of power aﬀect people’s lives, experiences and subjectivities. Governing technologies and techniques shape not only how societies are ordered,\nhow resources are used, what people do and feel, what kinds of lives they can\nlive, but also how they govern and produce themselves as subjects. However,\nrelations of rule never fully dominate the governed subject. People are clearly\nnot only passive victims to the relations of rule to which they are subjected.\nThey choose alternatives and act within (and even peek beyond?) the conditions of possibility that governing discourses deﬁne and that material circumstances dictate. A clear causal mapping of (cause) power and eﬀect is\narguably impossible, and agency remains evasive.1 In short, human beings\nsurely exercise agency and enjoy some extent of freedom. Yet, they are also\n(self-)governed in the very exercising of the freedoms that they enjoy.\nThe complex, intricate relations between governing and agency clearlyinvite critical inquiry and mapping, yet remain at least partially incognizable\nin any eﬀort to explore or chart them. Simply put, querying the agency of\nbeing governed is a specious yet alluring – and, we argue, important –\nendeavour. In so doing, we as scholars can begin to comprehend the ways in\nwhich relations of rule condition people’s lives and the ways in which people\nshape the eﬀects of such conditioning.\nSuch insights are hardly novel. The complex relations between diﬀerentforms of power and their eﬀects have been the subject of much scholarly\ndebate, and have inspired many rewarding and innovative theoretical developments in diverse ﬁelds of study. Most signiﬁcantly, the writings of Foucault\n(1991, 1998, 2003) on governmentality and biopolitics undoubtedly have been\ngreat sources of inspiration for a growing number of scholars who have productively explored and analysed how rationalities, techniques and technologies of government are applied in order to make societies and their citizens\ngovernable.2 In addition to theoretical inquiry, much empirical work borne\nout of a governmentality framework queries the details of how technologies\nof government inform policies and strategies.",

      "title": "Variation at the edges: A liminal approach to assessing social meaning in borderlands",
      "abstract": "Borders are dividing lines – traditionally geographic, but also social – associated with a sense of identity: sameness on one side, and otherness across the threshold. People who inhabit borderlands are particularly attuned to the minutiae that define these edges, arguably more so than people who live deeper inland. This heightened awareness makes borderlands fundamentally interesting to sociolinguists because of the significance of language in defining category boundaries (e.g., Watt & Llamas 2014).\r\n\tThe inherent variability of language poses an analytical puzzle, however: how should we separate social correlates of structural change from socially-driven, identity-laden variation? Structural changes can move through a language system without becoming imbued with strong social meaning (e.g., Labov 1994), such that patterns coinciding with social categories aren’t necessarily indexical of those categories. Stereotypes can offer a starting point for investigating social meaning, but language attitude (e.g., Baker 1992) and dialectology (Labov, Ash & Boberg 2006) have demonstrated that we attune to more than easily-articulated stereotypes (e.g., Preston 2002). In any given borderland, how do we know which variation is doing locally-meaningful identity work? \r\n\tThis paper presents an analytical approach focusing on the linguistic practices of liminal people – border-crossers – as a way of identifying which features are perceptually relevant to the border in question. I explore the socially-reified borderland of gender, considering liminality within the context of transsexuality. A sociophonetic analysis of young trans men (female-to-male transsexuals) in urban New Zealand shows that they are selective in which variables they have adapted in their transition: they have triaged their linguistic landscape and picked out which features are interpretable in their community as indexing gender. This methodological approach is extendable to linguistic exploration of more traditional borders, by drawing on geo-politically liminal people to identify variation that is likely to be relevant in the borderland communities themselves.",

This question is critical for creating and maintaining healthy socio-cultural normative systems (i.e., socially \"normed\" shared beliefs, values, attitudes, practices, commitments, rituals, etc.) that allow individuals within a community to function well (and ideally thrive). It also bears on the question of how virtues develop, and which ones will be prioritized – i.e., those necessary for protecting existing normative systems, and those needed for corrective purposes, when normative systems become dysfunctional and change is required. This introduces space for variation, both within and between cultures. It also highlights a problem – the imperfection of our moral knowledge and the vulnerability of our normative systems to error and corruption. The challenge we face is having an understanding of ourselves as moral beings oriented towards \"the good\" that is stable enough to be meaningfully shared and passed down (as a set of normative systems) to future generations, yet is flexible enough to adapt and change as our cumulative experiences bring that understanding into question.",

      "title": "Critical Reflections Concerning the Concept of Participation in Social Intervention and Research",
      "abstract": "In processes oriented towards social change and transformation, the specification of different concepts and levels of participation is an important intellectual and epistemic challenge. Critical questioning of participation in social intervention and research is fundamental for structuring a common understanding and a grammar for intervention, which supports, in theory, the construction of a type of architecture of participation, that is, a conceptual network that sets the parameters for the evaluation of participation. The concept of participation, used so frequently in a populist way, can adapt as easily to objectives of regulation, as to social transformation, and can be subordinate to such divergent paradigms of social intervention such as task-centered interventions, the building of opportunities for development and the processes which aim to improve personal and social decision-making. One of the major goals of participation is to increase the power of individuals and collective decision-making. Beyond this individual and micro-level dimension, it reveals processes of co-construction of social alternatives and structures of opportunity on the meso level (the community) and the macro level (the political instance). Thus, participation in the present day constitutes a strategic axis for social intervention and research. It is necessary to reflect about it. How to operationalize participation? How important is the way it tackles and develops participation in research and transformative social intervention?",

      "abstract": "In the current managerial approach of social work, social work services are expected to strive for a unambiguous identity: social work services must clarify what they do and whom they are doing it with/for. In this article it is argued that this search for a unambiguous identity of social work services is problematic. One of the consequences is the loss of discretion of social workers, who aren’t allowed to work with problems that fall out of range of the identity of the service. The idea is that every unique question needs a unique answer by a unique service. This constricts discretion, which is necessary to meet the complexity of the problems that social work encounters. The search for an unambiguous identity also focuses on a methodological identity rather than a sociopolitical one. The focus on the methodological identity of social work often stresses the individualisation of social problems. Problems such as poverty are seen in terms of problems of exclusion from care rather than exclusion from society. In the article it is argued that the discussion on the identity of social work must broaden its view from the search for a methodological identity towards a search for a socio-political identity: this implies that social work services reflect on broadening rather than limiting their discretion and reflect on the question whether the problems that social work encounters are care problems and/or societal problems.",

The research method used is descriptive qualitative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;by using inclusive public service theory, and accessibility theory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;While&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; collecting the data through observations, in depth interviews and literature studies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keywords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility, Public Facilities, Implementation, Persons With Disabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abstrak&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=\"AbstractText\"&gt;Penyandang disabilitas dalam kehidupannya masih mengalami berbagai hambatan yang berasal dari lingkungannya. Minimnya kesempatan yang diberikan kepada mereka menyebabkan mengalami keterbatasan akses dalam pemenuhan kebutuhannya, baik yang menyangkut sebagai individu maupun sebagai bagian dari warga negara. Akibatnya, partisipasi penyandang disabilitas di tengah masyarakat menjadi rendah sehingga hanya dianggap sebagai beban dan sebagai obyek santunan (&lt;em&gt;charity&lt;/em&gt;) sehingga pada akhirnya terciptanya eksklusi sosial dimasyarakat. Sejak negara turut meratifikasi CRPD (&lt;em&gt;Convention on The Rights of Person with Disabilities&lt;/em&gt;) dan memuatnya ke dalam Undang-Undang Nomor 19 Tahun 2011 diharapkan &lt;em&gt;social awareness &lt;/em&gt;tentang penyandang disabilitas mulai tumbuh. Salah satu daerah yang turut mengadopsi adalah Provinsi DKI Jakarta melalui Perda Nomor 10 Tahun 2011 tentang Perlindungan Penyandang Disabilitas. Jumlah penyandang disabilitas di DKI Jakarta tahun 2019 sebanyak 14.459 jiwa. Tingginya tingkat mobilisasi di DKI Jakarta sepatutnya turut diimbangi dengan pemenuhan aksesibilitas fasilitas publik bagi semua warganya tanpa terkecuali. Ketersediaan infrastruktur fisik yang ramah bagi penyandang disabilitas dapat meningkatkan kapabilitasnya. Penelitian ini mempunyai tujuan untuk melihat bagaimana pemenuhan aksesibilitas fasilitas publik bagi penyandang disabilitas di DKI Jakarta melalui Perda Nomor 10 Tahun 2011. Metode penelitian yang dipergunakan adalah deskriptif kualitatif dengan menggunakan teori pelayanan publik inklusif, dan teori aksesibilitas. Sedangkan pengumpulan datanya melalui observasi, wawancara &lt;em&gt;indepth&lt;/em&gt; dan studi kepustakaan. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa implementasi perda terkait fasilitas publik bagi penyandang disabilitas masih belum optimal. Masih ditemukannya fasilitas publik yang belum ramah dan tidak dapat diakses oleh penyandang disabilitas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kata &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unci: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aksesibilitas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fasilitas Publik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Implementasi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Penyandang Disabilitas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Further, since sociolinguistic studies generally require some level of ethnographic involvement, planning and conducting the study almost always involve going back and forth between pre-determined definitions and designs and new understandings about what and how to study, gleaned from ongoing participant-observation in the community of study.",

Institutional corrections can come exogenously from a regulatory state that brings in command and control or incentive mechanisms (pecuniary or not-pecuniary), or that reassigns property rights to correct the failure. But solutions can also emerge endogenously from the group, through self-governed institutions, with similar mechanisms of material or non-material incentives, as well as social norms or conventions.",

It goes beyond success at a single point in time, as well-being is dynamic in nature, and is affected by numerous factors, including one's personality, habitual behaviors, social relationships, socioeconomic status (SES), the environment, and cultural aspects. A growing body of literature suggests that proactively supporting and building individual and communal well-being allows people to not only survive but to truly thrive in life. At the individual and organizational level, various interventions and activities have been developed to support and build well-being. Public health and public policy are well suited to target the external context—creating the conditions needed for members of the community to prosper. As a whole, thriving in life is a complex, multiply-determined phenomenon.",

      "title": "Civil Activism In Local Communities: Motivation Of Participance, Performance And Resource Relationship",
      "abstract": "This article considers conditions and factors of civil activism at micro-local and meso-levels of social relations. Civic activism is viewed as attitudes and practices oriented towards solving social problems of different levels through social creativity and self-organization of citizens. Self-organization is the process of establishing direct ties and contacts between citizens to solve personal and socially significant problems. Participation in collective actions, associated with provision of amenities and assistance, becomes increasingly widespread among representatives of local communities in cases of legal insecurity and a deficit of material and information resources. Initiators of collective action are citizens themselves, their neighbors in the house (street), representatives of public organizations, less often - representatives of government bodies or management companies. As results of the survey showed, respondents are more willing to engage in any initiatives organized by others than to act as their immediate initiator. Basic motives of civil activism are a pursuit of preventing social environment of a residential territory from degradation, helping people in a difficult life situation and satisfying needs for altruistic and collective types of behavior. Actors of social work consider it to be quite efficient in terms of social significance (e.g. improvement of apartment houses and surrounding areas, improvement of a legal base, educational effect for the younger generation, preservation of cultural traditions) and personal development (e.g. acquisition of experience, specific knowledge, competencies in the field of public benefit, multiplying social capital, increasing self-esteem, improving self-esteem, obtaining diplomas, letters that can be useful for career advancement).",

      "title": "SOCIAL FACTORS INFLUENCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES CONSUMERS’ BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "In case of dental care consumption, a very special influence will have the social factors. This influence, from the level of consumers’ behavior can be analyzed on two distinct levels – that of normatives impose by the social organization particular for the community that the individual live and that of the influences of the social groups that individual are interacting with. Dental healthcare services consumption is conditioned at the level of consumption motivations by complex needs which are not confined only to the physiological needs of removing pain caused by a certain dental condition, but are going towards the need of self-image improvement, increasing the appreciation offered by the others group members, the congruence with other consumers decisions within the group (family members, friends, colleagues etc). It is important to note in this context the fact that the influence exerted by consumers exogenous factors (external influences in which we can integrate those from the social groups also) will be combined with the one exerted by endogenous factors (personality, learning process, perceptions, attitudes, motivations etc), representing a continuum that shape consumers and allows in the same time the society shaping by them. The present article proposes a research conducted on dental healthcare services consumers. Results revealed the importance that a series of variables like the importance given to image in the workplace, family, friends and colleagues perception towards dental aesthetic, social class has in the context of consumer behavior. It is also noted that the influence of variables is mediated by the importance given to self-image, dental healthcare services consumption being determined by complex needs, consumption motivations being physiological – specific to some medical conditions and psychological – aesthetic or induced by the pressure corresponding to the need to comply with social norms.",

La disorganizzazione dell'orizzonte cronologico dell'esistenza č intesa come una conseguenza delle grandi trasformazioni culturali avvenute nel corso degli anni '70 e '80. A loro volta, questi cambiamenti sono conseguenza di piů discrete modificazioni avvenute nelle relazioni familiari e nella struttura sociale. A livello individuale ciň ha prodotto un'epidemia di disturbi narcisistici che si esprimono in manifestazioni psicopatologiche in passato inesistenti o infrequenti (disturbi alimentari, condotte antisociali, diffuse appetenze patologiche e tossicofilie vecchie e nuove). Mentre nel campo delle dinamiche istituzionali č in aumento la conflittualitŕ esplicita e/o implicita (secondo il modello bioniano dell'attacco-e-fuga o della dipendenza passiva) che coesiste con il venir meno dei conflitti strutturali che strutturanti fra le classi e fra le generazioni.

Mayo (1880-1949) accomplishes modern acceptance of works motivation, that of introducing the theory of human relations, theory in which people, in their process of output, are not following only to ensure money and to preserve an employment, but to be appreciated, respected and also to be integrated into a community. In its common meaning, motivation is defined with all intern movable of guidance, even if they are innate or purchased, acknowledged or not, simple physiological necessity or abstract ideals. An important step in solving labour's motivation is relative acceptance of human necessity systematisation. Related to concept of Maslow, people basic needs could be systematised in five groups, from importance point of view, so that we have: physiological needs (food, water, clothes, refuge, sex); work security needs, (work security, order, lack of threat and fear), social needs of affiliation or of acceptance (group affiliation, settlement of human relationships, acceptance by group, attachment); need of respect (the assertion of art and competence, professional prestige, importance); self achievement needs (self-developing, maximisation of own potential, self-achievement).",

To be successful, public scholarship must be animated by a pluralist conception of society, a vision of the social world that recognizes that all of us live among different and incompatible cultures and that even the cultures we claim as our own have incommensurate and incompatible standards.",

A focus on individual self-actualization is useful, but a focus on sheer self-reliance is not likely to encourage one to try to get things done with and through other people – to be a manager or a leader. Managers and employees who were stymied by the struggles over power and influence that emerge from interdependence and differences in points of view have moved to a world of smaller, simpler organizations, with less internal interdependence and less internal diversity, which are, as a consequence, less political.",

      "title": "Adjacent Opportunities: Reach-From Self to Social Collaboration",
      "abstract": "Within the world of social entrepreneurship, there has been a focus on scaling programs to meet the needs of more and more people. This scaling effort has only had a limited effect to bring about the intention of the work being done. Part of the reason for this limitation is that scale is an industrial age term that is not applicable to human relationships or interactions. It aptly describes what takes place within the mechanical world, a world in which widgets are produced one after the other with little or no differentiation in how they are manufactured. Scaling of these efforts, which may range from being very simple to being quite complicated, do not accurately describe what takes place in the complex world of human interactions. Complex and complicated describe two very different kinds of worlds. Scale can take place in any environment in which the physical pieces can be brought together. Complex interactions and relationships are all situational and context-dependent. They take place within an environment that influences the interaction, whether those are prevailing cultural situations or coming out of specific ways of thinking about the world.When we are involved in complex interactions, whether we are relating to only one other person or to many, something emerges out of those interactions that is greater than the sum of the parts and is not contained alone within the parts. Complex interactions are for the most part bio-based, non-mechanical, non-linear and take place among complex adaptive systems. Since social entrepreneurs, being human complex adaptive systems, are involved in interactive relational efforts, as opposed to the mechanical processes of manufacturing, scaling operations is simply not an effective description of what is taking place. Perhaps a better term for describing and growing these social interactive efforts is, reach. Reach is defined here as an extension from self toward other. In making that effort, it is an invitation to meet and join and relate within a mutual interaction, and toward that end, form a social collaboration.While there may be many more ingredients within the interactive soup from which our reach emerges, there are three essential elements that help describe the extension of our reach beyond the self toward other. They are: Encounter, Engagement, and Enactment. However, at any point within this interactive system, rejection can surface and derail the entire process effort. But when these three elements are effectively applied, our reach can be extended toward the development, goals, and objections we envision. It is within this reach toward other that we move from an individual effort to one embodied in relationship and interaction, and ultimately social collaboration.But what do we mean by encounter, engagement, and enactment? Encounter is how we meet other, our willingness to be open to another and meet them, not just superficially, but at a level of connectedness that lowers our barriers and allows a genuine and authentic conversation to take place. This requires a level of self-awareness and mind-training to be able to show-up ready to encounter the other. Our same old ways may not be enough to build the relationships required to extend our reach if we are stuck in old ways of thinking and we are unable to do the work required in encountering another. That work shows up in how we get to know one another.We learn about each other through the stories we share about our life experiences. We learn how we relate to each other and the world through our reaction to those stories-do they keep us down, enliven our lives, limited our ability to develop, demonstrate our perception of humor, our willingness to meet the world as it shows up. When the stories we tell about ourselves emerge from an open and friendly heart, we connect. That ability to connect and remain open to the goodness we find in that encounter with another readies us for the next step we must take together. …",

      "title": "Health Equity: from concept to application in healthcare system",
      "abstract": "Equity is the prime virtue of social institutions, and its role is as truth is for human thought system [1]. Equity has been studied in various areas such as economics, politics, and judicial system. One of the areas of social equity that has recently been considered by experts is health. Health is defined as comp lete physical, mental, and social well -being. Health refers not only to the physical well-being, but also focuses on social, emotional, spiritual, and cultural well -being of the whole society [2]. Equity in health could be defined as absence of unfair disparities in health. Since social equity and fairness can be interpreted differently by different people, its definition requires measurable functional criteria. For the purpose of functionality and measurement, equity in health can be defined as absence of disparities or systematic prejudices (or in the most important social determinants of health) among social groups with varying levels of social entitlement or deprivation in the social hierarchy. Health inequities systematically expose socially deprived groups to problems associated to their future health. Social entitlement or deprivation, based upon wealth, power, and prestige, determines how people are grouped in the social hierarchy. Deprivation may also be understood as being deprived that can be absolute or relative [3]. Not all health inequities are unjust, only those specific health inequalities systematically created between more and less entitled social groups are unjust. For instance, we expect young people to be healthier than older people. It is expected that baby boys weigh more than girls at birth. Men have prostate cancer problem and women do not. It is hard to judge all these inequalities unfair. Even though differences in nutrition or immunization between boys and girls, or differences in et hnicity or race could be a major concern to equitable approach in likelihood of receiving proper treatment for heart attack [3].",

      "abstract": "The term preferences or system of preferences relates to tastes defined on a set of alternatives. The term choice refers to a pattern of behavior that takes the form of choice from a set of alternatives. In the context of collective choice, that is, choice by a number of individuals, the alternatives can be possible decisions of a group of judges or of a jury, the possible modes of action faced by a board of directors, different policies considered by a government, local community, committee of experts, a political party that wishes to win an election, or a group of civil servants. The use of the terms social preferences or social choice is common in social contexts in which the chosen alternatives affect several individuals (some or all members of society). These terms play an important role in areas of economics and political science that are concerned with decisions that affect different individuals. Not only are these individuals affected by the social decision, they or their representatives are often directly involved in making the decision. In economics, for example, decisions on family consumption are made by family members, decisions on the business strategy of a company are made by members of the board of directors and decisions on government policy are reached by members of a committee of experts.",

      "abstract": "How can organisations cultivate professional and social networks which accelerate knowledge sharing throughout the employee life cycle? The increasing complexity of the workplace environment and continuously changing processes makes it relevant for many organisations to invest in their social network structures, communities, and knowledge sharing. However, ultimately these social and relational processes are depended on the employees’ personalities, interests, ownership, and motivation and which do not necessarily correspond with the organisation’s strategy, priorities, timing, and resources. This constitutes a paradox between the strategic priority for networked learning and the employees’ interest and motivation to participate in knowledge sharing. Both elements are true, interconnected and mutually exclusive elements and raise a paradox (Lüscher, 2019:8) for networked learning designers in organisations between intended design and uncertain evolution.",

Por otra parte, el crecimiento sostenido de la poblacion mundial ha provocado que se haya producido un aumento sin precedentes del tamano de las ciudades, con la consiguiente polarizacion tanto de los estratos sociales como de los espacios urbanos. Este proceso ha estimulado la aparicion de necesidades inexistentes hasta el momento que se han sumado a las necesidades tradicionales de trabajo, formacion y ocio, como la necesidad de acceso al sistema de movilidad. Las grandes distancias, ademas, obligan a utilizar modos de transporte motorizados, lo que puede suponer una causa de exclusion para los integrantes de los estratos sociales mas bajos, generalmente sin acceso al vehiculo privado.\r\nAnte una situacion de vulnerabilidad extrinseca o espacial, un servicio de transporte publico urbano articulado en torno a una red de transporte eficiente cuyo area de influencia cubra todo el espacio urbano supone una disminucion de las desigualdades existentes entre los diferentes estratos sociales, permitiendo a los mas desfavorecidos el acceso al sistema de movilidad urbana y, por lo tanto, la entrada y la participacion en los diferentes espacios urbanos de las ciudades, con el consiguiente incremento de su capacidad para acceder a todo tipo de oportunidades.\r\nEn este trabajo se va a profundizar acerca de la vulnerabilidad espacial en Madrid, a nivel de seccion censal, evaluando la accesibilidad de la poblacion que habita en los diferentes espacios urbanos de la ciudad.

      "title": "Networks, norms and trust: explaining patterns of lifelong learning in Scotland and Northern Ireland",
      "abstract": "If we accept the notion of a learning society, it seems logical to conclude that some social arrangements promote learning more than others. It also follows that different social arrangements are likely to promote different types of learning. Most attempts to explore the Learning Society, and identify the different factors which promote lifelong learning, have focused on either the prospects facing individuals (particularly ‘access factors’ associated with entry into learning programmes or the barriers which prevent entry) or on the fate of nations and other large organisations (here, the focus tends to be on policy issues or the impact of external change factors). Our work within the ESRC Learning Society Programme1, while accepting the importance of both individual and macro levels, focused on what might be called the meso-level of institutional environments and the belief systems of those who inhabit and shape them. In particular, our work was concerned to find out whether patterns of participation and achievement in organised learning were associated with those intermediate relationships, shared values and habits known to some sociologists as ‘social capital’ (Bourdieu, 1985; Putnam, 1993; Coleman, 1994; Riddell et al, 1999). This paper draws on a detailed empirical study of schools attainment and adult learning in Northern Ireland and Scotland. At the outset, in 1995, we asked whether there was less adult learning in Scotland and Northern Ireland than elsewhere in the United Kingdom (Field and Schuller, 1995). We noted that there seemed to be strong evidence in both societies of an apparent divergence between very high rates of attainment in initial education on the one hand, and reports of relatively low levels of participation by adults on the other.",

      "title": "Can collaboration and self direction be learned? A procedural framework for problem-based learning",
      "abstract": "Introduction Around the world, governments, authorities, and educators are grappling with primordial questions about the purposes of institutionalized education: What are the aims and consequences of education for individuals, communities, and societies? Can it be a source of important life-skills and knowledge? The fronts on which classroom, school, and system-policy reform is currently proceeding are many and varied (Darling-Hammond, 1997; Jackson & Davis, 2000; Lee, 2001; Newmann, Smith, Allensworth, & Bryk, 2001; Slavin & Fashola, 1998; Wiske, 1998). In many cases, however, the issues at stake come down to a familiar set of debates about: * classrooms as sites for cognitive learning and growth * schools' capacities to maximize their intellectual, technological, human, and organizational resources * systems as distribution sites for economic, social, cultural, and intellectual resources John Dewey (1916) observed that there is something extraordinary, perhaps even vaguely miraculous, about education: By various agencies, unintentional and designed, a society transforms uninitiated and seemingly alien beings into robust trustees of its own resources and ideals (p. 67). It is significant that one of the first major applications of the new ways of orienting to human behavior and thought offered by the then-new cognitive sciences should be in the field of education. Bruner (1960) pushed for a renewed interest in the idea of mind, and challenged social scientists to account more faithfully and cogently for educational phenomena and concerns.1 In setting up the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies in 1960, Bruner (1990) and his colleagues sought: to establish meaning as the central concept of psychology-not stimuli and responses, not overtly observable behavior, not biological drives and their transformation, but meaning.. .to prompt psychology to joining forces with its sister interpretative disciplines in the humanities and the social sciences (p. 2). At the level of teacher-student interaction in the classroom, according to Ramsden (1992), the main aim of teaching is simple-to make learning possible. Among the recent teaching methodologies relevant to this discussion are collaborative, and constructivist learning (Jonassen, 1999), co-operative learning (Johnson & Johnson, 2003), and problembased learning (Dolmans & Snellen-Balendong, 2000; Gijselaers, 1996; Gijselaers & Schmidt, 1990; Schmidt, 1993) as well as the notion of 'situated cognition'(Vygotsky, 1962). The idea that learning takes place in active, contextualized situations is often used to express dissatisfaction with models of formal knowledge and traditional academic inquiry. This is based on an assumption that most teaching-learning situations focus on the acquisition of inert concepts-for example, algorithms, routines, and decontextualized definitions-and are of no use because the students cannot transfer or apply their learning to other situations. In comparison, common descriptions of problem-based learning (PBL) emphasize the active, situated nature of learning that takes place in such environments.2 PBL offers: * experience-based learning * the development of inductive and deductive reasoning skills * the simultaneous use and challenge of prior learning * opportunities for both independent and collaborative activity * context-specific knowledge use * complex problems in which students encounter ambiguity and multiple perspectives Thus, the key arguments in favor of PBL are that it: * enables students to learn new information-using learning strategies through the activation of their prior knowledge * prepares the students for the workplace through opportunities to learn social and communication skills * enhances the students' intrinsic interest in the subject matter The major complaints about PBL are that it: * does not deliver the deep learning that it promises (Glew, 2003) * does encourage ritual behavior and mindless routine in students, leading to the failure of inquiry and team learning (Dolmans, Wolfhagen, van der Vleuten, & Wijnen, 2001) Since there is empirical evidence to support both sets of arguments, this article critically analyzes the procedural and implementation framework of a PBL environment in a specific setting (namely, at the Republic Polytechnic of Singapore) and offers a discussion of some key lessons learned from the authors' experience. …",

      "abstract": "In general, diversity can be conceptualized as the expression of opposites (BARROS, 2008). Despite the homogenization of several kinds and in the various areas promoted by the current process of globalization, the so-called ‘flat world’ will never be able to express the whole without considering the parts. In such a context of different ways of being in the world, language learning is a crucial condition for citizenship education, it is the key to get to know other people (BYRAM, 2006). Because of that, educational processes have been going through significant changes, fostering, among other things, postures aligned with the new world order, where the preparation of learners to able to exercise their rights at a global level and take advantage of mechanisms which guarantee their intercultural citizenship, has continually gaining ground. Linguistic education has been taking a similar path. In its scope, discourses and pedagogical practices which take into consideration the sociopolitical character of any educational process start to be required. In other words, it has been demanded an egalitarian linguistic education which, above all, struggles for diversity and is able to guarantee total inclusion, creating ample opportunities, especially for those learners who come from less privileged classes and historically marginalized groups. Having human diversity in the background, the article aims to discuss the role of the contemporary language teaching professional, highlighting the challenges and commitments which await them at different levels, and the central position this professional occupies at this crucial moment of the global society in which we fight for the historical, cultural and social (re)construction of our differences.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we examine the notion of linguistic and other types of societal diversity that have become an important factor in evaluating economic, political and societal progress. While most of the existing research on the measurement of diversity has been focused either on the number and size of different groups, this approach fails to take into account the degree of their distinctiveness. Thus, it is important to incorporate the notion of distances or dissimilarity between groups which should help resolving the difficult group identification problem. We discuss various ways of measuring similarity between groups, the wide range of fractionalization and polarization indices and their impact (positive or negative) on various economic and political outcomes. To mitigate the negative impact of linguistic fractionalization, societies has often chosen to standardize by reducing the number of official languages. The numerous examples of such standardization policies (in the Russian Empire, India, Sri Lanka, among many others, including the European Union) lead to the feeling of disenfranchisement experienced by some population groups, and often end up failing. The search for a compromise between efficiency and the sentiment of being disenfranchised represents a serious challenge for any multi-lingual country or union; we examine this problem in the context of the European Union for which good data are available.",

For very different reasons, they rebel against established orders and authorities and question existing boundaries and conventions.

      "title": "Ethical Investment of German Non-Profit Organzations - Conceptual Outline and Empirical Results",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Non-proﬁt organizations are generally seen as hybrid institutions between the market and the State. The term ‘non-proﬁt’ can be misunderstood, however, as it is frequently interpreted as meaning ‘no-proﬁt’. In contrast, the way in which proﬁts are generated is typical for many non-proﬁt organizations. The so-called ‘non-distribution constraint’ dominates their ﬁnancial behaviour; usually the statutes of non-proﬁt organizations ban the distribution of realized periodical surpluses between members of the institution. Instead they demand that assets be accumulated within the organization and used only for organizational objectives (see Hansmann 1980 and Salamon et al. 1999). These objectives can be generalized as representing and articulating the interests of certain stakeholder groups; for example, they offer services otherwise not supplied by private companies or public institutions, or they promote dialogue with companies and the State on socially important issues. Many non-proﬁt organizations devote their activities to certain values or principles, often very closely related to moral stand-points or ethical views, such as the conservation of nature, social services, catastrophe aid, etc. The funding of those activities often depends on the legal form of the organization. In many cases the organizations are funded by membership fees, donations, and income from invested assets (e.g. foundations whose income is derived from their capital endowment). It is this latter form of funding that is addressed by this paper. Both proﬁt-making organizations and non-proﬁt organizations pursue ﬁnancial objectives with their investments. Non-proﬁt organization are, however, additionally motivated to promote the intangible objectives and values of their organization. In this respect there is also, or can be, a close link between their investment behaviour and the so-called socially responsible investment (SRI) or ethical investment. This form of investment opens up the possibility of non-proﬁt organizations incorporating their organizational principles and values into their investment decisions (see Salamon & Coe 1997). Investing ethically also presents the opportunity to send signals to their target member groups and, related to this, achieve strategically desired external effects that are in line with their organizational mission. The empirical analysis in this paper focuses on the willingness of German non-proﬁt organizations – especially those whose self-conception involves a strong commitment in their mission and values to ethical concerns – to subject their investment decisions to ethical, ecological and/or social parameters.",

      "title": "The psychology behind graffiti involvement",
      "abstract": "A person’s sense of belonging within society has been described as being a convergence of\ncognitions, behaviours and emotional affect as well as an environmental experience (Pretty et\nal., 2003). Moreover, the desire for a sense of place belonging within society is not constricted\nby age, gender, ethnicity or economic status. For, as Antonsich (2010) points out, both society’s\n‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ have an inherent longing to claim bodily, temporal and/or ephemeral\nownership of a place within society. Once they have located this place, their sense of belonging\nis realised through their physical or cognitive occupation of that space. Such occupation may\nbe permanent (i.e. residential) or, transitory in nature (Grillo et al., 2010). To identify with\ntheir selected place within society it is commonplace for insiders and outsiders to use language\nmarkers to indicate their occupancy of that space to other members. In the case of society’s\ninsiders these markers typically include such things as residential addresses, business cards and\nclothing/accessories emblazoned with a club, church or organization’s logo. In contrast, society’s\noutsiders (e.g. graffiti crew members) often resort to monikers (e.g. cryptic tags) to inform fellow\noutsiders of their sense of place, belonging, or identity affiliations. For example, graffiti crews\nregularly use zip or postal code numbers (e.g. 5163) to identify their suburb of origin or tagging\nterritory and letters to denote their place location (e.g. HU – Hills Unit; WC – Wanneroo\nCrew; AB – Aus[tralian]-Boys), tagging range (e.g. A2M – Ashfield-to-Midland; ACK – AllCity-Krew; UTB – Up-Town-Boys), cultural origins (e.g. BP – Black Power; BWC Blackand-White-combined; ABC – All-Black-Crew), identity (BB – Bowl Boys; SK8S – Skaters;\nBK – Bike Krew), tagging times (ANC – All-Night-Crew; DNK – Day-Night-Crew; M2K\n– Morning-to-[K]night) and focus activity (FNC – Fun-Not-Crime; DF – Drunken Fools; DK\n– Dope-Krew; LBB – Lone-Bum-Boys; NSH – Non-Stop-Havoc; SDC – S[e]Duce-Crew)\nto name just a few. Such monikers demonstrate that while the crew’s tags can appear to be\n‘mindless scribble’ to those outside of the graffiti subculture, to those within the graffiti sub -\nculture they are well known and informative.",

      "title": "Multi-unit questions in institutional interactions: Sequential organizations and communicative functions",
      "abstract": "This article deals with multi-unit questioning turns used in different genres of institutional interactions. Analyzing in detail a corpus of about 400 multiunit questions from health care interactions, court trials, police interrogations, and social welfare office talks from Sweden and Finland (all in the Swedish language), a number of sequential patterns are established. Some of these sequential organizations revolve around the interplay between declarative and interrogative units. Several interrogatives in a series usually narrow down questions, for example, by suggesting candidate answers to the initial more general questions. However, many multi-unit questioning turns are concluded with an appended generalizing question. The communicative functions of these different question delivery structures are summarized. We argue that the theory must be sensitive to differences between communicative activity types. However, on the general level, we propose that designing a multi-unit question is an attempt at solving a complex communicative task, which typically involves several, possibly mutually conflicting, demands on the speaker. For example, in court trials, the avoidance of leading questions must be balanced against the need for precise answers. At the same time, the use of an appended generalizing unit might be formulated to secure anything that could count as an acceptable response.",

      "abstract": "Many professions, organizational, and institutional settings are required to ensure the care and support of migrants at different times of their life in exile. Sometimes favoring legal-political criteria, sometimes social-health criteria, these working frameworks raise the question of the room for maneuver, the spaces of play to be built in order to support the challenge of confronting experiences of deprivation, fear, astonishment at what was experienced “there” and/or what is experienced “here,” and work that consistently exposes people to the risks of “dirty work.” The issues of recognition are essential: recognition of the subject in the category to which he or she is assigned (foreigner, asylum seeker, undocumented, unaccompanied minor, immigrant worker, etc.), but also recognition of professional practices, not only through the prism of professional rules, but also through cultural work that resists the forms of dehumanization contained in the various modes and systems of “welcoming.” The intensity of affects, psychological tensions, conflicts, and ethical suffering can lead to exhaustion and even collapse. This questions the collective resources for thinking about an ever-uncertain form of action such as the means of subverting the impediments or deviations that impact negatively on the activity.",

      "abstract": "Discussing the first-person pronoun I, Silverstein (1977: 142) argues that it is the role of speaker in a speech event that is denoted by the pronoun. Grammarians analyzing such forms are therefore “in the realm of social anthropology.” The same applies to illocutionary forces, deference behavior in speech and sociolinguistic variation, all considered (parts of) social actions by Silverstein. Now, by an automatic reflex almost, a statement that some phenomenon is part of social anthropology is taken to entail that not only is it extragrammatical, it is actually “beyond pragmatics,” at least as pragmatics is conceived in the restricted, Anglo-American tradition. Phenomena studied by sociocultural linguistics and psycholinguistics were simply stipulated to be outside the domain of pragmatics, although in practice, researchers found it quite difficult to conceptually tease these apart from pragmatics (see Levinson, 1983: 27–29). Sociolinguistics, for example, sets out from the obvious assumption that language is a social phenomenon, performed by social actors, and relates language use to social class, ethnic group, color, gender, interpersonal relationships, etc. Such assumptions are not too different from the contextual definition of pragmatics (see 2.1.1), where attention paid to the users of the language makes a phenomenon pragmatic. Thus, it seems that if pragmatics handles contextual factors in communication, it should include sociolinguistics, since the context perforce has a social dimension. This is indeed the European research tradition (and John Benjamins has been publishing a thriving book series called Pragmatics and Beyond since 1980). Silverstein adopts neither position.",

Yet agreements in international relations, business, and personal relationships show that people can regulate their conflicts of interest and ideology constructively and sometimes to mutual benefit. When individuals, and their groups, create such mutually beneficial, integrative agreements, they promote economic prosperity, stabilize society, and reduce conflict. Key insights from social-psychological science show (a) when and why people initiate negotiation, (b) how negotiators’ cognitive strategies manage complex and uncertain information, and (c) how their goals and motivations can release their capacity to create value in conflict and deal-making. These integrative agreements grow from both concern for own interests and respect for the other side. Reaching integrative agreements is cognitively taxing and difficult, yet facilitated when negotiators adopt long-term perspectives focused on own and others’ interests rather than immediate competing positions. Institutions can help negotiators to seek integrative agreements that benefit all rather than some by nurturing mutual respect and promoting benign, low-pressure environments.",

Through descriptive analysis, observations and interviews several findings were obtained: a)  community empowerment through the agroecotourism development  has not been run optimally; b) low competence of human capital; c) initiatives are top-down; d) lack of social capital socialization resulted in the many missing value systems in the community; e) development of agroecotourism seems redundant because the strengthening of social capital is not yet a consideration for implementation.Elements of value system which are necessary for social capital for community empowerment are: a sense of love, trust, self-esteem, empathy, honesty, openness, mutual sharing, altruism, visionary, and rationality; while advancement in meeting the material needs of the people is the initiative from the community at the grassroots level, a continuous and planned socialization and commitment is required.

      "abstract": "The connection between arts and social work is a rapidly developing area. However, the specific advantages of arts-based research for social work have yet to be articulated. In research in general, arts are defined as less important than words, or numbers – a leitmotif, or illustration (Martinez-Brawley et al., 1997). Often ‘art’ is experienced as the opposite of ‘science’ and thus the opposite of ‘evidence’. In social work specifically, arts are experienced as a luxury, an illustration rather than content, peripheral rather than the ‘on the ground’ problems that social work deals with. Often social workers feel that they have not been trained in the arts and so cannot use it. This is based on a misunderstanding of what social art is. Indeed, arts-based research is most traditionally connected to education, where the use of images is a natural language for children (Eisner, 1997). Of late, however, we see a ‘visual turn’ in social sciences in general, and also in social work practice and research. This includes the use of community art, Photovoice, outsider art, arts for social change, arts and health, arts to humanise institutions, de-stigmatise minorities, and to give voice to silenced groups (Chamberlyne &amp; Smith, 2008; Huss, 2012, Huss &amp; Bos, 2019). This has extended the use of arts-based research in social work. This book aims to capture this promising process. It will show how arts-based research is in fact an especially effective methodology to embody, and will articulate many of the epistemological aims of, social work research.",

(1) 통합은 사회적 차원(social integration)과 체계적 수준(system integration)으로 구분된다. (2) 통합의 문제는 사회해체(social disintegration)만이 아니라 과잉통합(over-integration)도 포함한다. (3) 사회통합과 체계통합은 서로 영향을 미친다. 기존의 통합 논의들은 이 사항들을 고려하지 않아서 문제들을 만든다. 사회적 수준과 체계적 수준을 구별하지 않고 논의를 진행하여 불필요한 혼란과 혼동을 유발시킨다. 또한 각종 사회문제들을 통합이 해체되어 생기는 것으로 간주하여 문제 상황을 적절하게 인식하지 못한다. 특히 적지 않은 사회문제들이 과잉통합으로 인해 생길 수 있다는 점을 보지 못한다. 마지막으로 무조건적인 통합은 문제가 되는 상황에는 긍정적인 역할을 미칠 수 있겠지만 다른 부분과 영역에서 또 다른 문제를 야기할 수 있다는 점을 간과한다. 그런 의미에서 통합은 해결책이면서 동시에 문제의 촉발자이기도 하다. 이런 점을 고려치 않은 통합 요청과 이를 실현하고자 하는 노력은 문제를 해결하기보다 문제를 더욱 심화ㆍ악화시킬 수 있다.",

For all we know, writing was communicative rather than private from its inception (Harris 1986; Coulmas 2003), and some of its earliest functions are bound to public display. Property marks, brands and border stones, for example, speak to all members of a relevant community. Monumental inscriptions, too, appear early in all literate cultures. In the modern sense of the word, ancient civilizations were not (fully) literate, because in antiquity the art of writing was confined to a scholarly elite rather than being a basic qualification for full participation in society (Goody 1987). Yet, even when writing was a specialized skill and literacy restricted, the exhibition of visible language marked a fundamental change in the human habitat. It changed the way people saw the world, it changed their worldview, it changed their attitude towards and awareness of language, and in many ways it changed the organization of society.",

      "title": "Pragmalinguistic analysis of multimodal satirical discursive practices in Re-nha-nhau in a transcultural/translingual context (Madeira)",
      "abstract": "Humour is often used for aesthetic, pedagogical and sociocultural purposes in satire, either dividing and/or uniting interlocutors, and simultaneously uncovering power relations, i.e., injustice and inequality (Sousa 2009a-c; Sousa, Bazenga, &amp; Antunes 2009). Further studies are claimed (Duch 2014) to be still undertaken about the way humour is conveyed in (trans)cultural / translingual contexts as the ones in insular settings like the archipelago of Madeira (Portugal). Hence, it is relevant to see whether humour strategies evidenced in a satirical newspaper; Re-nhau-nhau (a local publication issued in Madeira throughout the 20th century), could entail a way of raising citizens’ consciousness of the sort of power relations in cosmopolitan contexts (following the notions by Norrick, &amp; Chiaro 2009, Dovchin, &amp; Canagarajah 2019). Locals / residents in Madeira have been reported to be both under the sovereign influence of Portugal (as a Portuguese region), and the British socio-cultural, economic, as well as linguistic influence, due to the century-long (trans)cultural contact (Sousa 2017). Thus, this paper of empirical and exploratory kind intends to account for the way power relations are addressed in humour discursive practices, selected from a satirical newspaper issued in Madeira during dictatorship in Portugal. Do caricaturists only portray unfair situations via diverse humorous strategies to make readers aware of injustice to be overturn, in part, via the implementation of fairer government measures in the following decade? A pragmalinguistic approach underpins the analysis of twenty-two caricatures, selected from Re-nhau-nhau (between 1934 and 1948), in the line of research suggested by Kecskes, &amp; Romero-Trillo (2013). A set of British public figures, like Henry Hinton and Graham Blandy, frequently displayed in this satirical paper, have led the selection criterion of the corpus to be studied, given their meaning potential as multimodal discursive practices. This study entails the study of coherence, irony (i.e., echoic irony in Attardo’s stance, 2000), speech acts (Austin 1962; Searle 1996) and face-threatening acts (Brown, &amp; Levinson 1987) as mechanisms to achieve humour and social intervention goals in the corpus selected for this study. Research findings point to the relevance of pragmalinguistic strategies to disambiguate humour strategies as well as the underlying aesthetic and pedagogical effect of caricatures in Re-nhau-nhau. Power and agency are overturned and defamiliarized in the dialogic process of meaning making always with a humorous undertone, sometimes making use of conceptual metaphors and translanguaging. Considering the principle of ridendo castigat mores, this satirical paper points to some discrepancy concerning the way the sets of British residents (Mr Hinton and Mr Blandy) are represented, being Henry Hinton the most openly criticized figure at the time.",

      "abstract": "The literature of social dilemma explores the willingness of group members to \nengage in actions that help their group (Dawes, 1980; Komorita & Parks, \n1994). Such behaviors are broadly labeled cooperative behaviors. When a \nperson acts cooperatively, he or she engages in an action that is beneficial to \nthe group, but is typically not in their own short-term self-interest. As a consequence, people are often reluctant or unwilling to act cooperatively, and gaining sufficient cooperation to sustain groups is a constant issue within both \ninformal and formal groups. (This does not mean, of course, that there is no \nreason for people to help groups. The core insight of the social dilemma literature is that people benefit from helping groups, since their long-term interests \nare typically served by group survival. In that sense, people are better off personally if they can avoid acting in their short-term self-interest.)Types of cooperative behaviorThere are two potentially valuable types of cooperative behavior: individual \nand structural. Some cooperative behaviors are individual in character and \ninvolve actions that group members take on their own. People engage in individual solutions to social dilemmas when they use less water when there is a \nwater shortage, turn out their lights to conserve electricity, and/or use a car \npool to minimize the use of gasoline (see chapter 1). In each of these cases, \nindividuals have some freedom to choose how much to act in cooperative \nways, and society benefits to the degree they choose to behave cooperatively.",

Particular characteristics of complex social systems and learning from change processes in complex social systems are described. The relevance of systems thinking to epidemiology, public health research and 'evidence' is noted including the importance of recognising wider context, the relationship between knowledge and uncertainty and development of new methodologies. It is noted that approaches to public health such as socio-ecological, community development and policy, regulation and 'whole organisation' approaches show some features of systemic approaches but that this is not always explicit or consistent. Opportunities and barriers to further development of systemic approaches to public health in the new organisational arrangements for public health in England are highlighted.",

Nonetheless, traumatic suffering, particularly when associated with cataclysmic world events, political ideology, and/or institutionalised oppression, is characteristically processed through an assortment of memorative activities and occasions frequently in conflict or contradiction: autobiographical archiving; reminiscence; nostalgia; public commemoration; the influence of memory milieux such as family, state, class or religion; historical consciousness as reflected in public or academic scholarship; memory sites such as museums, heritage societies and public archives. The content or even viability of memory is caught up in such systems, ‘which either support, suppress, distort or even destroy the potential of other collectives and of individuals to remember’ (Domansky, 1997, p. 238). ‘Memory work’, such as might be undertaken in the construction of a memory play, may involve the negotiation of a complex infrastructure consisting of ‘all the different spaces, objects, “texts” that make an engagement with the past possible’ (Irwin-Zarecka, 1994, p. 13). Further, history and memory may be seen to take different paths of engagement with the past. Historians aim to capture the synchronicity of a past moment so that conditions and interpretation match, attempting to bridge temporal distance in a sort of intellectual leap.",

      "title": "BUSINESS COMMUNICATION IN FUNCTION OF IMPROVING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE OF THE COMPANY",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONWe all learn to communicate from the earliest age. It is interwoven with all the additional elements that the family teaches its child and they have to do with family, social or national culture. It is with this culture, additionally refined from the social functioning of the individual up until his/her employment, (i.e. the educational system and all the remaining formal and informal organizations in which the individual has participated and communicated, which in turn have affected his/her behavior) that he/she enters the new organization.The culture of behaving presents a mixture of manners and actions that the individual uses and through which he/she manifests them in the surrounding. Each individual is different because he/she presents a product of various cultural influences: family, social, educational, informal and formal organizational associations.Organizational culture refers to a core set of attitudes and practices that are shared by the members of the organization and that determines their behavior. (Engelen et al. 2014). The organizational culture can be noticed by the clients who frequently communicate with the employees, by the manner of communicating as a dominant form of communication, etc. This is a sign of good or bad organizational culture and contributes to building the image of the company. Each company strives towards building an image and self-branding or branding its products, yet that cannot be achieved without appropriate communication as part of the organizational culture.1. BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONCommunication has been widely accepted by scholars and academics as the lifehood of an organization, because communication is needed for exchanging information, exchanging opinions, making plans and proposals, reaching agreement, executing decisions, sending and fulfilling orders and conducting sales (Blalock 2005).Communication is essential for the success and growth of an organization (Udegbe et al. 2012). It is widely accepted that business management and business educators perceive communication skills as highly valuable to employees and organizations alike (Conrad and Newberry 2011). Communication in context of the activities of one organization (products, services, clients, coworkers...) is called business communication. It is a process of generating, transmitting, receiving, and interpreting messages in interpersonal, group, public, and mass communication contexts through written and verbal formats. This type of communication is aimed toward organizing activities that will lead the members of the company to making a profit. (Safran 2010).Business communication is done in and outside the organization; of course within the context of the organization itself. Effective business communication is the key to planning, leading, organizing, and controlling the resources of the organizations to achieve objectives, and may be formal or informal in nature (Hynes 2005). Unlike formal communication, informal communication is not tied to the work place and hierarchy. This communication, in any type of form, no matter whether in or outside the organization is done quickly.The vertical communication which is communication between a superior and a lower ranked employee is most often formal, unlike the lateral communication which is mostly informal.Since communication is a precondition to development, access to and control over the means and processes of communication are properly questions of great social importance. (Hoover, Venturelli, and Wagner 2009). Even though the basic goal of every sender in every communication is for the recipient to get the information precisely and fully, this does not always happen. Sometimes the information does not reach the recipient, fully or partially, due to various barriers in the surrounding. There are two types of communication barriers: external and internal.There are also two sides in the communication process. …",

      "title": "Dislocation and Social Change",
      "abstract": "The concept of dislocation can be found in various fields including social psychology, urban planning, philosophy, political science, public health, migration studies, environmental psychology, and international psychology. Specifically, social dislocation refers to detachment and loss of identity, home, or culture in individuals and groups (Alexander, 2000). It often occurs among migrants and is a concern with the current wave of migration among large numbers of people globally, in response to specific events, circumstances, and geopolitical realities in their communities. Global migration and forced displacement are primary causes of displacement. Dislocation can also occur in communities in which people remain in place and experience isolation or exclusion. Shifts in society, job loss, and disconnection from cultural ties can result in detachment from family and community. Loss of identity can result in weaker connections among individuals and groups, and loss of integration in society. Theory and research on dislocation can be found across a broad range of disciplines, as the concept describes a dialectical reality that exists between sociological and psychological phenomena. That humans are social creatures has been widely accepted in both sociology and psychology (Umberson & Montez, 2010). When people are isolated and separated from their social community, it has an impact on their psychological health both individually and collectively. Resilience in individuals and cultural groups can protect against dislocation during the challenging experiences of migration and displacement. Receiving communities can increase positive acculturation through strategies that promote integration of newcomers and accessing their cultural strengths.",

      "abstract": "In the mid 1970s, during field research carried out in the villages of Breb and Sirbi in Maramure*2 (northern Transylvania), I was confronted with a socio-cultural life where rituals and ceremonials centred around birth, puberty, marriage and death had preserved their viability due to the people's belief in their capacity of relating fundamental conceptual values (defining rules of social interaction) to the random present (Karnoouh 1983: 37). Puberty and marital rites and ceremonials build coherent and meaningful ensembles. The processes which make them up interrelate and interact by completing and/or opposing each other not only on one but several levels of sense. The power of dance, as part of these ensembles, rests only in acts of performance, in the people's of making sense of and in linking experience to other sets of ideas and social experiences (Blacking 1984: 20). Thus, the focus of my inquiries shifted from the dance object to the dance process and finally to the dancing people. The double orientation of the research towards the people and towards the unitary ensemble of their practices, contribute to disclose the meaning of the symbol and its function for young men's and women's social interaction, social status differences and balance of power in the pre-marital stage of life.",

      "title": "Strategic Communication for Non-Profit Organisations [Hardback]",
      "abstract": "Communication in the public sphere as well as within organizational contexts has attracted the interest of researchers over the past century. Current forms of citizen engagement and community development, partly enabled through digital communication, have further enhanced the visibility and relevance of non-profit communication. These are performed by the civil society, which is 'the organized expression of the values and interests of society' (Castells, 2008) in the public sphere. Non-profit communication feeds the public sphere as 'the discursive processes in a complex network of persons, institutionalized associations and organizations,' whereas those 'discourses are a civilized way of disagreeing openly about essential matters of common concern' (Jensen, 2002).\r\nDespite the relevance in the public sphere, non-profit communication was never properly defined within communication research. The aim of the present book is to offer an overview and report on Strategic Communication for Non-Profit-Organisations and the Challenges and Alternative Approaches. Considering the assumption that a key principle of strategic communication is the achievement of organisational goals, the majority of research developed in the field has used business environments to develop theories, models, empirical insights and case studies. Here, we take a step towards new approaches centred on the concept of non-profit in various dimensions and from various perspectives, showing the diversity and complexity around this subject and at the same time the need of further theoretical and empirical work that provides frameworks and also tools for further understanding of the phenomena.",

A comparative overview of legislation and administrative practice reveals that the term homeless is used to cover quite diverse living conditions of socially deprived individuals or households. The European research discourse has largely been influenced by the policy context under which homelessness emerged as a social construction in Europe. Social exclusion entails an accumulation of deprivation in several of the most important domains of human activity: labour, education, consumption of public services and care, family and informal networks, communication, political participation, leisure and recreation. The combination and the feedback between background, intermediate and personal factors causes homelessness. The proximate or personal causes of homelessness are a set of factors associated with a personal history and personality features of individuals.",

The studies investigated natural errors in which people called a familiar person by the wrong name, misremembered with whom they had interacted, or mistakenly directed an action at an inappropriate person. These studies tested the relational-models theory of A. P. Fiske (1990b, 1991) that people use 4 basic models for social relationships. All 7 studies provide support for the theory; Ss tend to confuse people with whom they interact in the same basic relationship mode. In addition, Ss confuse people of the same gender. Other factors (age, race, role term, similarity of names) generally have smaller, less reliable effects, indicating that the 4 elementary modes of relationships are among the most salient schemata in everyday social cognition.",

      "abstract": "Imagine popular music cultures in the mid-2020s without digital platforms: no song snippets as part of TikTok trends, no Spotify playlists, no music videos on YouTube, no concert streams on Twitch, and no reels and stories on Instagram. Since the mid-2000s, web-based communication and creativity have become increasingly dependent on a relatively small number of digital platforms, which can now be understood as the sociotechnical nucleus of today’s internet (Dolata 2021). Platforms occupy a powerful position in modern media cultures, exerting a decisive influence on the exchange of information, processes of communication, and the organisation of work and markets, as well as creating digital spaces for social action (Dolata and Schrape 2023). Functional rules, defined by the tech companies behind the platforms, are expressed in the platforms’ interfaces and algorithmic logics (van Dijck et al. 2018). These functional rules do not determine the behaviour of cultural workers active on platforms, but they can substantially influence it – notably in the field of popular music. Due to the platforms’ pre-defined media formats, such as short-form videos, playlists, and similar content, it appears feasible to hypothesise that musicians endeavour to adapt their content – including songs, videos, visual media, and lyrics – to achieve optimal visibility within the digital spaces facilitated by these platforms.",

      "abstract": "Most institutional history moves slowly. One explanation for the slow movement of ideas, customs and practices is that political communication, like other forms of interaction, often operates in a circular or self-referential manner. This chapter, by focusing on social movements, explores how we can circumvent or break out of these circular patterns of communication, how institutions can become more responsive to new issues, ideas and challenges, and how social forces can reshape and influence the rules and procedures of institutions. Social movements can play a crucial role in challenging the slow movement of institutional history. There is general agreement among social theorists that the collective action by social movements ‘involves a specific type of socially conflictual relationship’ and that the types of social movement include the ‘classical’ workers' movement at the turn of the century, the student and civil rights movements in the 1960s and the ‘new social movements’ which, in the 1970s and 1980s, focused on or rediscovered questions of the environment, women's rights and peace (Renon 1994: 599). In the area of social movements the notion of the slow movement of institutional history is by definition subjected to a challenge: ‘Most social theorists agree that this mode of collective action [social movements] involves a specific type of socially conflictual relationship’ (Renon 1994: 599).",

The current work utilized a visual measure to assess frequency, variety, and degree of contribution to social fulfillment of 17 social behaviors. Overall, the conceptualization of the need to belong as flexible and able to be satisfied by a variety of social behaviors was supported; both traditional and nontraditional social strategies were related to positive outcomes. Results suggest that nontraditional strategies may contribute an added layer of vibrancy to our social lives.",

La reforme a fait du bruit des deux cotes de l'Atlantique et la traduction defectueuse a conduit, depuis 10 ans, a des controverses dommageables. Plus generalement, cet exemple permet de considerer ce qu'on peut considerer comme une reticence de la comparaison internationale des politiques sociales - et, sans doute, plus largement, de l'analyse des politiques en sociologie et en science politique - a poser serieusement la question des differences culturelles et de la variete des cultures politiques.",

This paper examines the potential for adoption of this Statement, through interviews with managers of a not-for-profit organisation, social enterprise, and private sector for-profit organisation. Current social reporting approaches are explored, together with opportunities and barriers to adoption of the proposed Statement. Findings highlight the complexity of applying a single social reporting framework across sectors (particularly for private sector for-profit organisations), as well as the reluctance towards comprehensive reporting until positive results are achieved for ‘survival’ stage third sector organisations.",

The paper is concerned with some experiences made with such boys, aiming to put them in a situation where they could try a different relation with rules: they usually come indeed from a social marginal environment, where rules (namely the ones accepted in central society and enforced by law) are generally refused; here two experiences are examined: a regular job within a big manufactory (electrical household appliances), as well as a practical sailing course with participation to a big final regatta, where the boys have had a positive relation with rules, namely the ones necessary to achieve the goals connected with the experience. From a theoretical point of view, such experiences could give a new perspective on the classical concept of “discipline” proposed by Foucault, putting it in relation with the Marcuse’s theory of “necessary/additional repression”.",

      "abstract": "Modern socio-economic transformations and the development of ideas of universalization of individual rights and needs emphasize the urgency of overcoming the new forms of inequality and finding effective mechanisms for consolidation and integration of social systems to avoid negative social phenomena that threaten national security, preventing the exclusion of certain groups from public life, forming the stable social ties and interpersonal cooperation, which is an important condition for the successful development of the state and society as a whole. The changes taking place in Ukraine today are marked by the ambivalence of their impact: on the one hand, there are positive changes towards the necessary reforms, on the other – the aggravation of social tensions due to instability, bottlenecks or imperfections of the reform process itself, increasing income gaps and limiting the access of large sections of the population to resources, including basic social services, etc. Despite the significant number of scientific papers on the phenomenon of social exclusion, the issue of substantiation of the forms and features of social exclusion, as well as the dynamics of its spread in Ukrainian society remains insufficiently elaborated. Thus, the purpose of this article is to study the phenomenon of social exclusion in Ukrainian society. In the context of the study, the reasons underlying the formation of the phenomenon of social exclusion in Ukraine in the early stages of statehood are substantiated, the problems that determine its spread in modern Ukrainian society, and the consequences of the impact on society are highlighted. A categorical analysis of the phenomenon of social exclusion is carried out, in particular by forms of manifestation, criteria and factors, scale of distribution, levels of formation, and nature of social ties.

      "abstract": "Despite many points of divergence, social scientists and social theorists seem united by one primary concern: to identify what it is people are doing (or sometimes merely the negative of this, to expose that people are not doing what they took themselves to be doing, or that their peers or ancestors are not doing what folk had took them to have been doing). The thought that this might count as not only a viable but centrally important concern is grounded in a scepticism about the ability of societies’ ordinary members to reliably correctly identify their own and others’ actions. In this scepticism, such social scientists and social theorists usually situate themselves in opposition to ethnomethodologists and Peter Winch. This scepticism is grounded in a belief that ordinary or competent members of societies are unreliable authorities on the identity of their own and others’ actions because they are subject to systems of sociological refraction. The idea being that ordinary members of society are systematically misled as to the identity of their actions and those of their peers because they - or their perceptions of actions - are subject to the refractive properties of (for example) ideology, or folk theories of action, and so on. In this paper, I subject to analysis this core commitment of much social science and social theory.",

      "title": "An enquiry into the concept of social innovation: new theoretical and policy insights from recent developments",
      "abstract": "An enquiry into the concept of social innovation: new theoretical and policy insights from recent developmentsRelevant topic of call: ? Innovation and Entrepreneurship in ContextAbstract (max. 1000)Introduction:There is general consensus on that is the engine of growth and little doubt that, through innovation, entrepreneurs and businesses seek to realise opportunities for profit. By means of the compounded effect of innovations, at a macro-level, economic growth emerges from a creative destruction process. Social innovation, on the other hand, is often seen as with a social twist. In the latest years, the concept, or better the conceptualisation of social innovation, has produced a number of definitions and interpretations each with implications for social and economic development. Although a common definition of the concept hardly exists, distinctive tracts, widely used within the policy circles of the EU institutions, refer to social as the development and implementation of new ideas (products, services and models) to meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations. In other words, social is characterised by novelty, sustainability and social relevance in its means and effects. Adding to these, other definitions emphasise the empowerment of society, and application of democratic decision-making and inclusive participation in the design and operation of relevant ventures. Question:The theoretical implications of the definition(s) adopted are that social innovations are substantially innovations driven by social motives i.e. business-technological is driven by personal gain whilst social is driven by altruistic gain. A further consequence of this theoretical ante fact is that business-technical pertain to the private sphere whilst social to the social and public sphere.Is this necessarily the best way to look at and frame the concept of social innovation?The various conceptualisations of social reflect different dimensions and aspects of what ?social? and what ?innovation? is considered to be. Given this, trying to frame the concept of social becomes even more difficult. In this essay we are looking at the rationales behind the definitions and practices of social innovation, what social means for the social and economic growth trying to distinguish between social innovations tout court and other facets of the economic and social spheres which more often than not are classified under the social umbrella or plainly excluded from it. This dichotomy, even when extended to portray a continuum between technological/business and social innovation, evokes a framework which is closer to the linear model of than that the non linear-systemic view of innovation. The purpose of this essay is to analyse the definitions and practices of social through the lenses of the systems approach and to enquire into the how the systemic approach underlies policy rationales for policy intervention. Methods:This essay is meant as a theoretical contribution to the social debate and the rationale for social policy. The work underpinning it is based mainly on a critical review of scholarly contributions to social research and desk research complemented by discussions and interviews with scholars in the field of (social) policy.Results:From the extensive literature review many facet of the concepts of social are derived and discussed in the light of a systemic view. Several degrees of sociality of innovation are therefore extrapolated and classified according to the sphere of economic and social domain within which they reside. The (provisional) taxonomy is hereby presented in table 1The emerging taxonomy, on the one hand, reveals the elements of social that contribute to a systemic rationalisation of its definition, on the other hand, it shows the complexities of relations between actors, the underlying motives and the effects of social innovation. Conclusions:With the main aim to improve our understanding of social from an systems perspective and positioning social in the portfolio of types of innovations, we are confident that integrating the objects and the methods of analysis within a systemic framework sheds a brighter light on the rationales and motivations for social innovation, and consequently extend our understanding of policy intervention rationales.Main references:Christensen, Clayton M., Heiner Baumann, Rudy Ruggles, and Thomas M.

      "abstract": "In order to solve complex problems or make difficult decisions, people must strategically combine personal information acquired directly from experience (individual learning) and social information copied from others (social learning). The game of football (soccer) provides a wealth of real world data with which to quantify managers' use of personal and social information in selecting team formations. I analyse a 5-year dataset of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in the five top European leagues (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie A) to quantify the extent to which a manager's initial match formation is guided by their personal past use or success with that formation, or other managers' use or success with that formation. I focus in particular on the use of the 4231 formation, which was the dominant formation at the start of this period but showed a gradual decline in use over time. I find that, as predicted, a manager's choice of whether to use 4231 or not is influenced by both their recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the use of 4231 in the entire population of managers in that division (social information). Contrary to expectations, managers appeared to rely more on personal than social information, although this estimate was highly variable across managers and divisions. Serie A managers, in particular, showed a much stronger use of personal information, likely due to the rarity of 4231 in that division. Finally, there did not appear to be an adaptive tradeoff between social and personal information use, with the relative reliance on each failing to predict managerial success.",

Der Zugang zu Gutern und Dienstleistungen bzw. die Einflussnahme auf Entscheidungen uber personliche Netzwerke und informelle Kontakte wurde in der UdSSR Blat (блат) genannt. Bei Blat wurden unter dem Deckmantel des freundschaftlichen Aushelfens staatliche Ressourcenflusse zur Deckung des personlichen Bedarfs umgeleitet. Die Leistungen wurden nicht umsonst vergeben, sondern der Empfanger zahlte den staatlich festgesetzten Preis. Blat wurde nicht eingesetzt, um Leistungen unentgeltlich zu erhalten, sondern um den Kauf zu ermoglichen. Durch die Gewahrung des Zugangs zu knappen Ressourcen sicherte sich der Spender im Gegenzug den Anspruch auf eine Ausgleichsleistung. Die Abgeltung konnte sofort erfolgen, fand jedoch ublicherweise zeitverzogert statt – manchmal sogar erst Jahre spater. \r\n\r\nDie informelle Abwicklung verhinderte eine allgemein gultige Reglementierung von Blat-Aktivitaten, weshalb im Zuge dieser Diplomarbeit versucht wurde die sozialen Funktionsmechanismen von Blat anhand von vier sozialen Konzepten (Sozialkapital, soziale Netzwerke, Reziprozitat und Klientelismus) zu analysieren. Die dafur erforderlichen Informationen wurden anhand von acht problemzentrierten Interviews (vgl. Witzel 1982) mit Bewohnerinnen der ehemaligen Sowjetunion erhoben und anhand der strukturierten, qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse nach Mayring ausgewertet. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass Blat-Kontakte einen Ressourcencharakter aufwiesen, wenn es darum ging Leistungen zu erhalten. Die Basis des Austauschs bildete die wechselseitige Zugangsgewahrung zu Gutern und Dienstleistungen. Die hohe Prasenz von Blat in der Sowjetunion lassen auf die Existenz von Blat-Netzwerken schliesen, wobei zwischen den beteiligten Akteuren sowohl ein gleichberechtigtes, als auch ein asymmetrisches Verhaltnis bestehen konnte.",

      "title": "Called to repair injustice: Connecting everyday practices to societal phenomena, creating momentum for solidarity and change",
      "abstract": "Abstract I have been working with a model of witnessing for more than 30 years (Weingarten, 2000a). In this article, I add layers to its conceptualization by discussing several related concepts: the implicated subject (Rothberg, 2019) and ethical loneliness (Stauffer, 2015) among them. What distinguishes the Witnessing Model positions from the implicated subject is that the implicated subject is always aligned with power and/or domination, whereas a witness may not be. Certain responsibilities accrue if we take our implication seriously. Just as I have suggested there are steps one can take from positions two, three and four of the Witnessing Model to enter, return or remain in the aware and empowered position, a position from within which accountability is more likely, I offer ideas about how one can respond accountably when one acknowledges one's implication. Throughout this article, I raise questions, some of which I cannot answer. For instance, can empathic repair be undertaken by one party to a ruptured relationship, one segment of a society, without an unfolding process of mutual recognition and compassion? The contemporary moment in which we are living presents us with dire outcomes if the answer is “no.” The entire article is an extended meditation on the following central question: How can we, implicated subjects, practice solidarity to diminish ethical loneliness and create movement toward the personal, interpersonal and structural changes necessary to address the truths that our implication entails?",

      "abstract": "Abstract and Organization of the Session: of or plural knowledge are presented as social and methodological processes and conditions for the resilience of socio-ecosystems. But few information are provided on: (i) the modalities and practical conditions for these socio-cognitive processes, and (ii) the political and ethical dimensions of the co-production of knowledge for the resilience. Some studies discuss the resilience benefits from the complementary of different knowledge systems (Berkes & al., 2000 ; Long & al., 2003). These researches support that a combination of different knowledge systems can improve the management and the resilience of socioecological systems (Folkes, 2004). But what are the concrete modalities (kinds of articulation, redefinitions) of the various knowledge integration? As Bohensky and Maru (2011) point out, references to resilience are mostly theoretical or hypothetical rather than empirical. Furthermore, the word ?integration' remains problematic implying unequal social relationships between groups provided with different cognitive frameworks, as well as it suggest new ways of thinking the social act to integrate and the links created between different categories of knowledge (hybridization is not the only form - or result - of these news links). So, the words Integration and Co-production of knowledge impose to question the political issues of the socio-cognitive processes implied and the way the coproduced knowledge constitute instrumental categories for actors in development or political arenas. This point imply to consider the motivations, the forms of engagement and their justification by actors (researchers, politics, social groups) working in these processes of knowledge co-production for the socio-ecological systems resilience. Organization of the session After a brief introduction reminding the focus of the session, four papers will be presented. The both first ones will discuss some examples of what is usually done in terms of knowledge articulation and how it questions the nature of the coproduced knowledge. The both last papers will focus on approaches engaging various actors through different scales in the process of cobuilding, asking more specifically how to validate the knowledge co-produced : 1/ Ways of knowing and the production of blended knowledge when managing for resilience - Marcela Brugnach & Helen Ingram. 2/ Diffusion of agro-ecological knowledges for the socio-ecological resilience in the state of Oaxaca (Mexico). Some political and epistemological dimensions of different knowledges integration - Frederique Jankowski. 3/ Developing resilient, adaptive water management systems through a bottom-up participatory technology development process - A case study in four Indigenous communities in Canada - Khosrow Farahbakhsh. 4/ Knowledge synergies for the Anthroposcene - A Multiple Evidence Base approach - Maria Tengo, Pernilla Malmer, Thomas Elmqvist, Jacob Von Heland, Eduardo Brondizio & Marja Spierenburg If all these papers give priority to the meanings and empirical implications of the knowledge coconstruction, they refer as much to various scales of integration as diverse political context of knowledge co-production for resilience.

      "title": "ETIKA PROFESI DALAM PERSPEKTIF HUKUM ISLAM",
      "abstract": "Profesi tumbuh dan berkembang akibat dari perkembangan spesifikasi­ spesifikasi disiplin ilmu \r\npengetahuan yang ada hingga saat ini. Dengan adanya perkembangan yang terns menerus dari hasil \r\npemikiran manusia ini dan didorong oleh tuntutan kehidupan yang semakin khusus, maka profesi \r\nsebagai sebuah pekerjaan menjadi kenyataan yang sulit dihindari. Akibat lebih jauh yakni \r\ntimbulnya jenis-jenis profesi yang ada dalam masyarakat dan hubungan saling ketergantungan tiap \r\nindividu pada pelayanan profesional. Keberadaan profesi merupakan akibat dari kebutuhan masyarakat \r\nterhadap aspek-aspek kehidupan yang semakin komplek. Pengertian profesi sering disamakan dengan pekerjaan yang dilakukan oleh setiap orang, karena baik pekerja biasa maupun seorang profesional \r\nsama-sama menggantungkan kebutuhan hidupnya dari kegiatan yang dilakukan. Karakteristik khusus yang \r\nmembedakan profesi dengan pekerjaan lainnya adalah bahwa, kegiatan-kegiatan yang dilakukan \r\nseorang profesional harus dilandasi keahlian dan ketrampilan tertentu dan bersifat tetap. \r\nSementara pekerjaan biasa lebih didorong oleh pemenuhan kebutuhan hidup belaka tanpa dilandasi \r\nkeahlian yang memadai sebagaimana yang dimiliki para profesional.\r\nSemakin beragamnya profesi yang berkembang saat ini, berdampak pada kepercayaan masyarakat terhadap \r\npelayanan seorang profesional, sehingga masyarakat kurang memperhatikan perilaku-perilaku \r\nmenyimpang yang mungkin\r\ndilakukan oleh profesional. Hal ini disebabkan pula oleh kurangnya pengetahuan masyarakat. Dari \r\nsini timbullah berbagai kemungkinan terjadinya penyalahgunaan\r\ntindakan profesional terhadap masyarakat sebagai obyek pelayanan. Dengan melihat \r\nrealita tersebut, maka perlu adanya suatu standar pelayanan yang\r\nmelandasi seorang profesional dalam rangka menjalankan profesinya. Hal ini\r\nsecara intrinsik menunjukkan bahwa pelaksanaan suatu profesi akan berkaitan erat\r\ndengan kaidah-kaidah moral baik dalam putusan tindakan, mutu pelayanan dan akibat yang \r\nditimbulkan dari keahlian profesional tersebut.\r\nDari sinilah urgensi pembahasan mengenai etika profesi akan menemukan korelasinya. Dalam arti lain, \r\nsuatu profesi tidak hanya dipahami sebagai pelaksanaan suatu keahlian dan ketrampilan profesional \r\nbelaka. Namun akan selalu berkaitan erat dengan etika yang ada dalam masyarakat. Untuk mendukung \r\npelaksanaan suatu profesi sesuai dengan norma etik yang ada, maka diupayakan adanya kodifikasi \r\nterhadap kaidah-kaidah moral yang terdapat dalam dunia profesi. Hasil dari kodifikasi ini \r\nterwujud dalam kode etik suatu profesi yang bersangkutan misalnya, kode etik kedokteran, hakim, \r\njaksa dan lain-lain. Namun temyata keberadaan kode etik tersebut tidak menjamin pelaksanaan profesi \r\nyang bertanggungjawab. Dari sinilah pentingnya etika yang berdasar pada sumber hukum Islam yakni \r\nal-Qur'an dan hadits, karena hukum Islam yang bersifat Universal dan komprehensif mencakup segala \r\naspek kehidupan, termasuk di dalamnya etika dalam menjalankan profesi. Untuk menemukan etika \r\nprofesi dalam hukum Islam, sebagai padanan maka digunakan pedoman pokok profesi secara umum yaitu, \r\nprofesi yang dijalankan berdasarkan pelayanan (altruistic), herlandaskan pada nilai-nilai \r\nluhur, adanya sikap sosial dan memperhatikan",

Immigrants, in particular, are affected by their acculturation processes. Thus, when employees negotiate organizational workplaces, they need to factor in the influence of socio-cultural forces. Stereotyping is one way in which the external environment is manifest in workplaces. It has been found to be persistent, influential, and deeply impactful on careers. Stereotypes are affected by social and cultural factors, and in turn, they affect workplaces by shaping employees' perceptions and experiences. At the same time, the external environment can also present positive attributes for employees, for instance by being a source of social and emotional capital.",

Entre los aspectos abordados en dicho estudio, se consideró la relación entre factores sociodemográficos, el uso social de internet y percepción de aislamiento. Los resultados muestran una influencia diferencial de factores sociodemográficos (nivel de estudio, años de residencia, entre otros) en distintas dimensiones del aislamiento (vial, de lugares de trabajo, entre otros). Es decir, hay distintas variables asociadas a diferentes sentimientos de aislamiento. Por su parte, el uso social de internet, orientado a establecer lazos personales, generaría una sensación de “conectividad” que trascendería a otras esferas, de tal modo que aquellos que tienden a tener más contactos establecidos a través de Internet, tienden a no sentirse aislados en cualquiera de las dimensiones en que se desagrega la noción de aislamiento.",

While focusing upon the traditional issue of individual-gr oup differences, the theory is aimed at accounting for the distribution of group decisions by using formal hypotheses about the effects of social interaction when the inputs to discussion are individual member preferences. The basic assumptions underlying the model are similar in several respects to proposals by Restle and Davis (1962) and Steiner (1966) in group problem-solving research, and the model itself represents the general case of earlier theoretical notions by Smoke and Zajonc (1962), Davis, Hoppe and Hornseth (1968), and Zajonc, Wolosin and Wolosin (1972) in group decision making. In addition, several nonintuitive consequences of group decision making, assuming some form of the model, are discussed.

This mixed-methods study of 300 consumers of mental health services in the Southeastern US aims to better understand the impact of community supports, termed distal supports, on community integration and recovery from mental illness. Qualitative content analysis, tests of group mean differences, and hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed the following: (1) participants primarily reported receiving tangible support (e.g., free medication/discounted goods) from distal supports rather than emotional support (e.g., displays of warmth/affection) or informational support (e.g., provision of advice); (2) women and older participants reported more distal supports than men or younger participants; and (3) distal supports played a unique role in predicting community integration and recovery even after accounting for the influence of traditional support networks. Results highlight the importance of considering diverse types of social support in naturally occurring settings when designing treatment plans and interventions aimed at encouraging community participation and adaptive functioning for individuals with psychiatric disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Die Vitalitat von Sprachen kann u.a. daran gemessen werden, ob sie im beruflichen und namentlich im wissenschaftlichen Alltag eingesetzt werden (Gebrauchsfrequenz) bzw. eingesetzt werden konnen (Vorhandensein der entsprechenden Fachterminologie). Angesichts der Globalisierung der Arbeitswelt haben auch verbreitete Sprachen wie Franzosisch und Deutsch damit zunehmend Muhe. Ein franzosisches Gericht musste z.B. die Tochter einer amerikanischen Firma mit der Androhung von hohen Bussen dazu zwingen, Arbeitsanweisungen auf Franzosisch statt auf Englisch zu verfassen — nicht zuletzt wegen Unfallen aufgrund von mangelnden Sprachkenntnissen. In der Tat ist der Trend nach Englisch als lingua franca in vielen europaischen Betrieben und Universitaten allgegenwartig, und dies obwohl die Vorteile der sprachlichen und kulturellen Vielfalt schon vielerorts theoretisch begrundet wurden. Eine multikulturelle Organisation setzt sich nicht nur aus Personen mit unterschiedlichem kulturellen Hintergrund zusammen, sondern schatzt auch den Wert der Vielfalt hoch ein (Cox 1991). Sie bringt sowohl einer Organisation wie auch ihren Mitgliedern substantielle Wettbewerbsvorteile wie bessere Entscheidungsfindungen, verfeinerte Problemlosungsprozesse und grosere Kreativitat und Innovation (Page 2007). Sprachliche Anpassung hingegen kann Schaden anrichten, weil ‘those who assimilate are denied the ability to express their genuine selves in the workplace; they are forced to repress significant parts of their lives within a social context that frames a large part of their daily encounters with other people.’ (Fine 1996: 494) Allerdings ist es ein Irrtum anzunehmen, es musse immer die eine oder die andere Sprache verwendet werden. In sehr vielen Fallen aussert sich der Widerstand gegen die „Standardisierung“ (sc. die Wahl von Englisch als corporate language) in vielfaltigen Formen von Sprachmischungen — ein Basler Manager sprach von „Chuderwalsch-Esperanto“ —, in welchen die Sprecher ihr gesamtes mehrsprachiges Repertoire in kreativer Weise und mit grossem kommunikativem Erfolg einsetzen. Dieser Problemtik wird hier  aufgrund von Beispielen illustriert und diskutiert, die im Rahmen des Basler Moduls des DYLAN-Projekts (www.dylan-project.org) in Betrieben unterschiedlicher Typen in der Oberrhein-Region gesammelt wurden.",

We extend previous work in discursive psychology, in which notions of self or others' identity have been well-studied as categorial practices, by focusing specifically on the occasioned use of '[descriptor] person' formulations which index the characteristics of people. Drawing on a British corpus of 315 telephone calls about neighbour problems (e.g., noise, verbal abuse) to environmental health and mediation services, we show that callers build in-situ descriptions of self and neighbour for the practical activity of complaining or defending against accusations – as types of people that are, for instance, reasonable (e.g., 'I'm an extremely tolerant person'), in contrast to their neighbours' shortcomings (e.g., 'he's a rather obnoxious person'). Our findings demonstrate that psychological predicates of self and other, indexed through characterological formulations, are recipient designed (i.e., formulated to display an orientation to co-present others) in ways that shape the institutional relevance for service provision. We conclude that, like many other aspects of the psychological thesaurus, 'character types' are not just the preserve of psychologists but also a routine resource for ordinary social interaction.",

Aujourd'hui, la representation de l'individu autonome, qui pourrait battre en breche cette conception structurelle des parcours, doit tenir compte du fait que l'autonomie individuelle devient l'objet meme de bon nombre de politiques publiques (sociales et de sante, educatives et de formation, etc.). Si l'on prend cette entree, plusieurs choses sont alors a dire et a debattre : 1) ces politiques de l'individu produisent parfois des fuites : ce que nous appelons la non demande ; 2) ces fuites sont manifestement des parcours ; elles en ont les caracteristiques : imprevisibilite et reversibilite ; 3) d'autres offres s'organisent pour rattraper et rerouter les fuyards ; 4) ces offres engendrent d'autres parcours, parfois davantage prescriptifs, qui a leur tour peuvent provoquer d'autres fuites. Ce processus n'ayant pas de raison de s'arreter - car c'est la dynamique de gouvernement par l'Etat social de plus en plus liberal dans ses logiques de ciblage et de conditionnalite -, cette approche des parcours sociaux lies aux politiques publiques cherche a indiquer la nature consubstantielle et inflationniste de leur relation.",

      "abstract": "Models of reproductive skew have provided useful conceptual frameworks for analyzing social conflict and cooperation in groups of reproductively totipotent individuals, in that they specify explicitly how aspects of ecology and genetic relatedness can generate within-group variation in behavior and reproduction. The main outcome of many years of development and application of these models, however, is a growing consensus that transactional models apply to few if any real situations, and that the models cannot be critically evaluated because assembling sufficient quantitative information to allow critical tests of their assumptions and predictions is not feasible. The “top-down” approach of skew modeling, which makes strong yet unsubstantiated assumptions to extract explanations from data, can be contrasted with a “bottom-up” approach, which involves inference of convergences in sets of diverse social, demographic, and life-history traits across highly diverse taxa, and analyses of fine-scale divergences in small sets of traits between conspecific populations and closely related species. The bottom-up approach explicitly recognizes that each population and taxon exhibits a constellation of more or less similar evolutionarily interrelated traits, especially those that affect (1) the ecological circumstances that underly benefits of dividing labor, (2) the opportunities, costs, and benefits of using force (taking control of behavior away), coercion (cost imposition or repression), or persuasion (providing benefits) to modify the expression of conflicts of interest, and (3) the life-history trade-offs and feedbacks that coevolve with social adaptations. I illustrate this approach with examples of social convergences among insects, birds, and mammals (including humans, Homo sapiens) that yield insights into selective pressures, and present a model based on such convergences for the role of cooperative breeding in the origin and expansion of modern humans.",

      "title": "The Communities First Programme: A Case Study of Social Innovation",
      "abstract": "The research project aims to evaluate the extent to which the Communities First Programme has increased levels of innovation activity. The Communities First Programme is a Welsh Assembly Government initiative. The programme is designed to improve ‘opportunities and the quality of life for people living and working in the most disadvantaged communities in Wales’ (Welsh Assembly Government, 2002). The main themes of the Communities First Programme may be stated as: involvement, action, sustainability, innovation, entrepreneurship, problem solving and teamwork. Innovation may be considered to be a learning process, relying partially upon technological competence and partially upon ‘entrepreneurial and learning competence’ (Morgan and Nauwelaers, 1999). Fundamentally, the innovation potential of a region is heavily reliant upon socio cultural factors, which if appropriately developed may enhance the ‘collective learning and diffusion mechanisms’ of a region (Morgan and Nauwelaers, 1999). Indeed, it may be stated that there is a social dimension to successful innovation; Bachmann (2003) identifies the importance of trust in such social interaction between players/stakeholders in the innovation process. It should be noted that the impact of sociocultural issues upon innovative activity is notoriously difficult to measure. Given that similar sociocultural traits may affect several regions in differing intensities (Pilon and DeBresson, 2003). Further, Cooke, Roper and Wylie (2002) exploring the social dimension to innovation view innovation as the ‘result of interaction between economic actors in an open social system’. Pilon and DeBresson (2003) refer to the prerequisition of a form of socio-cultural openness as a genesis for innovation. The problematic issue here is likely to be how to capture instances of ‘socially interactive learning’ to facilitate evaluation. It is highly unlikely that evaluation methods founded on positivist principles may offer a justifiable means to capture such interaction. As champions of the pluralistic paradigm, Diez and Esteban (2002) strongly support the use of ‘participatory evaluation’. This enmeshes with the philosophy of policy evaluation contributing to policy making. Such an approach involves regional innovation policy stakeholders at all levels and at all stages in the policy making process. The research project explores the Communities First Programme in terms of business innovation and social innovation outcomes. Business focused innovation activities such as new: product, service, process or working practices are analysed and evaluated. For social innovation the new activities and services motivated by the goal of social need (Mulgan, 2006) are analysed and evaluated. Ultimately, the research project will consider the extent to which innovation policy stakeholders may/should be involved in the policy making process. As Diez and Esteban (2002) observe, a possible logical progression from stakeholder involvement in policy evaluation to stakeholder involvement in policy formulation.",

However, the point of departure must be the community.

It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional “receivers” (→ Models of Communication). Paulo Freire (1983, 76) refers to this as the right of all people to individually and collectively speak their word: “This is not the privilege of some few men, but the right of every (wo)man. Consequently, no one can say a true word alone – nor can he say it for another, in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words” (→ Freedom of Communication).",

      "title": "<i>Tell me Pastor</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract In any society, advice-giving and -receiving are everyday practices of knowledge transmission between people in private, public and in institutional contexts. Advice is part of a complex speech activity in which the speaker typically gives a directive which they believe to be beneficial to the hearer. Depending on the situation (solicited or unsolicited) and the relationship between hearer and speaker (familiar, hierarchical, expert or user, etc.), this speech act might also be seen as face-threatening. In face-to-face contexts, Sidnell ( 2005a , 2005b ) has shown the complexity of interactional organization of advice-seeking, advice-giving and -receiving. For many sensitive areas in social life concerning sex, relationship and health matters, advice is sought from experts (doctors, counsellors, etc.) in the anonymity of written exchange. Dear Dolly ( Mutongi 2000 ) or Dear Dr. Springer ( Springer 2013 ) as types of advice columns have existed in many newspapers and magazines around the world, including many postcolonial anglophone countries, ever since the early 1960s. This chapter looks at the construction of expert and user roles in the display of certainty, directness and evaluation in advice-giving in contemporary Jamaican newspaper advice columns ( Doctor’s Advice, Tell me Pastor ). Particular emphasis will be placed on the advice-seeker’s request as a form of confession and the assertion of moral attitudes and norms in the advice column Tell me Pastor . An outlook to user-user advice in online forums will also be given.",

      "abstract": "Across various domains---such as health, education, and housing---improving societal welfare involves allocating resources, setting policies, targeting interventions, and regulating activities. These solutions have an immense impact on the day-to-day lives of individuals, whether in the form of access to quality healthcare, labor market outcomes, or how votes are accounted for in a democratic society. Problems that can have an outsized impact on individuals whose opportunities have historically been limited often pose conceptual and technical challenges, requiring insights from many disciplines. Conversely, the lack of inter-disciplinary approach can leave these urgent needs unaddressed and can even exacerbate underlying socioeconomic inequalities.",

      "title": "Creating Sociological Awareness: Public and Applied Sociology",
      "abstract": "Introduction The following review essay focuses on three books that demonstrate how the complexity of socio-cultural issues can be broken down into specific patterns of behavior and symbols that define and give meaning to human activ ity, attitudes, social structures, and gender identity. Each employs variations of applied sociological research methods combined with an approach that has recently been labeled public sociology. Sociologists for many years have successfully balanced the application of scientific rigor with sociological theory as the foundation for exploratory investigations into a range of social problems in order to create a more informed populous and to facilitate social change; public sociologists seek to reach out to multiple publics in a manner that both facilitates an understanding of sociolog ical subject matter and instills a sense of empowerment and awareness among mem bers of disenfranchised groups (Klayman 2007). Despite critics' somewhat obtuse descriptions of this hybrid sociological prac tice, public sociology incorporates the theo retical and methodological tools of the disci pline. It is not, as some would have it, a partisan unscientific enterprise (Deflem 2005). Several well-known books by public soci ologists, including Steven Fraser's (1995) The Bell Curve Wars: Race, Intelligence and the Future of America, Massey and Denton's (1993) American Apartheid and Ehrenreich's (2001) Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, influenced the popular socio political discourse at the time of their publi cation. These, as well as many other works of public sociology, have tempered the neolib eral rhetoric championing cuts in welfare and other social programs, the devastating impact of urban isolation and poverty, and stereo types of the working poor. As exemplary works of Public Sociology, these books spoke to people at both ends of the eco nomic spectrum and elucidated complex social problems.",

      "abstract": "There is a great deal of controversy concerning the effects of mass communication on political socialization, in terms of both its size and direction (→ Media Effects). Political socialization can be understood as the processes through which democratic societies instill the proper norms among their members to maintain social institutions and practices. Most research on this topic focuses on how individuals engage in political development and learn basic civic skills, with family, schooling, peer groups, and media serving as the major factors involved in this dynamic. Early studies focused on adolescence as a critical period for political socialization, though this has given way to lifelong learning models, attention to generational differences, and consideration of civic modes of participation alongside the political (Sears &amp; Levy 2003; Sapiro 2004).",

A good is non-excludable if it is costly and counterproductive to exclude individuals from using it. It is non-rivalrous if one person's consumption cannot reduce or impede the ability of others to consume the good. When individuals do not take into account the marginal social cost of consumption, the public good becomes congested. Generally, a public good is also indivisible; one cannot meaningfully speak of units of a public good (e.g., ambient air).",

From a social science perspective, transnationalization leads to and is sustained by pluri-local cross-border social spaces at the micro, meso and macro level. At the micro level, transnationalization refers to habitual and accountable patterns of transnational perception and action in everyday life (such as telecommunication, shipment of goods or sending of money and information seeking across borders). At the macro level, it includes social institutions as complex programs of routines, rules and norms that increasingly structure significant terrains of life and span different countries (such as transnational educational careers or labour markets). Finally, at the meso level transnationalization is linked to the growth of organizations as stable and dense loci of cooperation with rules of membership, given structures and processes, and stated goals which span over different countries.",

      "abstract": "Often the studies of the social protest tend to give him an excessive importance to the act of protest. The variables that explain it can be contextual (resources, opportunities, cultural frames, etc), but the importance of the protest does not yield. Nevertheless, in many cases, the protest is manipulated by successes and blunders of the government, by absence or affirmation of certain policies. The educational conflict, in Argentina, during 1992, demonstrate a) a weak and relatively spontaneous actor, b) a conflict immediately after the lack of public policies that channel a process of transformation of the educational system and c) a decline of protest immediately after a governmental intervention orientated to the application of an educational global reform.",

      "title": "The Relationship Among Higher Education, Community Service Work Activities and “Connectedness”: Simply a Matter of Doing More and Expecting Less",
      "abstract": "IntroductionCommunity service activities and volunteer services that help bring isolated community members together are rapidly becoming popular areas of research in community psychology and sciences in general (Dale 791-796). Despite the increasing popularity of community service work activities, opportunities for interpersonal community service activities are more frequently being replaced with more technologically- based activities (Seifer and Vye Mihalynuk; Anderson 195-199). Many of these changes are primarily reflected through increased interpersonal technological and media innovations (i.e., social networking) that influence and increasingly define our relationships today. The purpose of the current study was to explore the relationship of participation in a variety of community service work activities with individual perceptions of connectedness and belonging to the community in which one resides.As a result of these rapid technological changes within communities, many individuals have reported feeling overwhelmed (i.e., burnout), alienated and disconnected within the communities in which they reside (Koepsell 14- 16). More recent research, however, has described modern technology as phenomena that may actually improve bonds but unfortunately seems to perpetuate and economic inequalities (Spears, Postmes, Lea and Wolbert 91-107). Since before the Industrial Revolution (early 18th century to the late 19th century), individuals within various agricultural industries and skilled labor have worked collaboratively within communities and townships to improve the quality of living conditions (Dunn, 2010). The nature and context in which industry developed was defined by the direct connection and relationship between consumer and manufacturer (Maw, Wyke and Kidd 20-33). Different types of innovations were beginning to develop with unprecedented speed: textile manufacturing, advances in agricultural development, advances in technology, iron making and newer energy sources allowed people to combine their skills and labor to produce goods that were distributed in greater quantities.People worked collectively by sharing individual skills that typically served a common good and purpose. A collective work environment allowed community members to work cooperatively and develop a variety of goods that also served to improve relationships among each other. Furthermore, the development of tools and commerce during the Industrial Revolution allowed members of communities to share their skills with each other in ways that gradually developed and produced a strong sense of community trust, integrity and identity (Green 75-83). The idea that a strong sense of community is contingent on community activism and involvement is certainly not a new topic in psychological literature. Karl Marx describes the deleterious psychological consequences of a society that prevents individuals from meaningful economic contribution (i.e., unemployment) as well as the psychosocial consequences of a labor force that experiences alienation from one another within the work force (Seeman 135- 143).Cooperative work environments offer more than increased product and technology development. Collaborative work environments also allow the participants to discover each other's strengths and skills by working within a shared environment. A key element among cooperative work environments is interdependency, that is, the combined efforts of groups of individuals as a way to achieve one goal that has benefits for all group members. Within more traditional work environments, members know that if they do not participate in their shared responsibilities, the quality of the product is compromised, thus negatively impacting the entire group.Robert Putnam (Putnam 137-174) noted that communities should still provide opportunities for individuals to work cooperatively because of the numerous psychological and long-term benefits to society: improved inter-ethnic relationships, greater creativity relative to the development of entertainment industry (Putnam also noted that immigrants to the United States account for three to four times as many Nobel Laureates) and broader economic development within underdeveloped regions. …",

      "title": "The Emergence of Social Consensus in Boolean Networks",
      "abstract": "Social order and unity require consensus among individuals about cooperation and other issues. Boolean network models (BN) help to explain the role played by peer interactions in the emergence of consensus. BN models represent a society as a network in which individuals are the nodes (with two states, e.g. agree/disagree) and social relationships are the edges. BN models highlight the influence of peer interactions on social cooperation, in contrast to models, such as prisoner's dilemma, that focus on individual strategies. In BN models, the behavior that emerges from peer interactions differs in subtle, but important ways from equivalent mathematical models (e.g. Markov, dynamic systems). Despite their simplicity, BN models provide potentially important insights about many social issues. They confirm that there is an upper limit to the size of groups within which peer interactions can create and maintain consensus. In large social groups, a combination of peer interaction and enforcement is needed to achieve consensus. Social consensus is brittle in the face of global influences, such as mass media, with the peer network at first impeding the spread of alternative views, then accelerating them once a critical point is passed. BN models are sensitive both to the network topology, and to the degrees of influence associated with peer-peer connections",

      "title": "Pemgambilan Keputusan dan Strategi Pemasaran Politik",
      "abstract": "Ketika kita memasuki era Revolusi Industri 4.0, diakui atau tidak media sosial memiliki kekuatan yang luar biasa. Hampir seluruh interaksi yang kita bangun atau selenggarakan dengan pihak lain tidak bisa lepas dari keterlibatan atau kehadiran media sosial. Tidak ada celah dari seluruh aktivitas manusia yang tidak bersinggungan dengan media sosial. Budaya, sosial, ekonomi, teknologi, olah raga, seni, alam, ruang angkasa, pendidikan, spiritualitas hingga politik pun semua meniscayakan kehadiran media sosial di dalamnya.\r\n\r\nGelombang Pilkada serentak yang beruntun datang untuk ketiga kalinya (2018) setelah sukses pada dua gelombang (2015,2017) sebelumnya juga menyiratkan bahwa medsos berperan sangat penting. Tidak hanya calon kepala daerah yang berkompetisi yang memberdayakan keampuhannya, tetapi juga partai politik pengusung. Itu sebabnya, meskipun media mainstream (koran, televisi dan radio) tetap eksis, tetapi fungsi tersebut telah banyak diambil alih atau tepatnya dikudeta oleh media sosial. \r\n\r\nKomunikasi yang dilakukan dalam partai politik sebagai wadah berorganisasi pun dalam beragam format. Format komunikasi dari anggota ke anggota dikenal dengan istilah satu level atau pola horisontal. Format dari anggota ke pengurus partai atau pengurus partai ke anggota dikenal dengan istilah pola vertikal. Format komunikasi lainnya adalah dari anggoa ke pengurus lalu ke anggota atau dari pengurus-anggota-pengurus disebut dengan istilah pola komunikasi silang. \r\n\r\nMereka secara intens mempercakapkan perkembangan dan isu-isu pemilihan kepala daerah atau chatting secara instensif terhadap topik aktual yang menjadi perhatian atau trending topic dengan menggunakan aplikasi whatApps, line, telegram, facebook. Tentu karena media yang digunakan medsos, isi percakapan atau konten sangat variatif. Da yang sangat serius, serius, hingga obrolan yang mendiskusikan isu-isu yang tidak penting berkait berita yang sifatnya desas-desus.\r\n\r\nPenulis sengaja memilih Pilkada Kota Kediri sebagai wilayah kajian empirik, mengandung maksud berdasarkan pertimbangan bahwa PDI Perjuangan adalah pemenang dalam Pilkada 2013 di Kediri dan pada Pilkada Serentak Gelombang ketiga tahun 2018, PDIP juga mengusung calon yang berkoalisi dengan Hanura. Detik-detik menjelang penutupan pendaftaran calon di KPU menjadi saat yang sangat menegangkan karena calon koalisi belum kunjung menyerahkan berkas pengusulannya. Ini yang sempat memantik demo ke Ketua DPC Hanura, seolah-olah Hanura tidak mau berkoalisi dengan calon yang diusung PDIP yang juga mantan Walikota.\r\n\r\nBuku ini ditulis sebagai pengembangan lebih jauh dari hasil riset lapangan kami yang berjudul Kajian Pola Komunikasi Berbasis Media Sosial Sebagai Penentu Strategi Pemasaran Politik Pada Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan, dalam skema Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi. Namun demikian, secara sengaja penulis juga melengkapi dengan perspektif lain yakni PR (Public Relation) sebagai sarana marketing politik. Ini dimaksud, ternyata dalam kontestasi politik apakah itu pada level pemilihan legislatif (DPR/DPRD termasuk juga pemilihan senator daerah/anggota DPD) serta pemilihan Presiden, menjual �branding calon� itu sama penting dengan menjual produk dalam konsep produksi barang/jasa di bidang ekonomi. Pilkada bukan sekedar festival politik, tapi lebih kepada bazzar politik. Dimana pembeli/pemilih memiliki otoritas penuh menentukan pilihan apa yang dibeli atau dipilih. \r\n\r\nPada bagian akhir buku ini, penulis menyajikan sisi lain kontestasi politik yang terjadi di AS ketika Obama, Hillary dan Trump berretorika pada masa pencapresan dan penerimaan kemenangan di antara mereka. Retorika adalah kajian awal komunikasi politik yang banyak memberikan inspirasi bagaimana opini publik itu juga sangat dipengaruhi kemampuan retorik sang kandidat. Mengkomunikasikan pesan perlu strategi yang relevan, pilihan media yang tepat sasaran sekaligus kelihaian membaca situasi yang terjadi saat itu. \r\n\r\nTidak mudah memang bagi politisi untuk memenangkan sebuah pertarungan politik pada era transparansi demokrasi modern sekarang ini. Kontestasi di Kediri, pemilihan Gubernur di Jawa Timur dan agak melompat jauh ke pemilihan Presiden AS seolah memberi gambaran riil betapa calon yang semula unggul dan partai pengusungnya relatif punya suara di legislatif ternyata kalah dalam pemilihan.\r\n\r\nApa maknanya itu? Berdasarkan data empirik yang peneliti kumpulkan baik melalui wawancara langsung dengan sejumlah narasumber baik pada level lokal maupun nasional serta dokumen kepustakaan, ternyata partai politik bukan preferensi utama konstituen menjatuhkan pilihan politiknya. Aspek lain yang perlu diperhitungkan adalah figur atau sosok yang dipilih. Persis sama dengan produk barang dan jasa, konsumen tidak begitu menghiraukan dimana diproduksi, tapi bagimana kualitas produk dan akseptabilitasnya di masyarakat.\r\n\r\nPada alenia penutup ini, penulis tak lupa mengucapkan terima kasih kepada pihak Kementerian Ristek Dikti yang telah memberi kesempatan kepada penulis untuk mengeksekusi hibah Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Tahun 2018 dengan Nomor 002/SP2H/LT/K7/KM/2017 tertanggal 26 Februari 2018, pihak penerbit Rajawali Pers Jakarta, LPPM UK Petra, seluruh kolega di Program Studi Ilmu Komunikasi UK Petra serta para mahasiswa ilmu komunikasi yang memperkaya khasanah dan diskusi ketika di kelas Komunikasi Politik dan Komunikasi Organisasi. Harapan kami buku ini memiliki sumbangsih akademis dan praktis terutama dalam konteks penyadaran pentingnya media sosial dalam Pilkada.",

      "abstract": "Along with the description of contemporary societies, including the indication of clear tendencies towards „individualisation” of lifespan, focusing on subjects that observe themselves with reflection, an issue appears regarding the creation of a community, including the educational one. A peculiar outline of the reflexive modernity is recognised on the basis the ways how individuals achieve social integration.Des pite the differentiating forms of social and cultural life, the foundation of the accomplishment of self and the society, is still „community”, which constitutes an encouragement to enter the issue of social (dis)integration, an inspiration allowing to bestow a defined sense on democracy, and socialization processes. Therefore, the need to consider the issues of communities arises, including their confirmation in education. To present a path for social integration, with the full awareness that in modern societies the „common good” ideal is being lost, one should be accompanied by indications regarding education itself. One may reduce them to how the community constituted due to and within education, ensured the integration of all entities concerned, and helped accomplish democracy.",

      "abstract": "Comme dans d'autres regions saheliennes, disettes et famines sont un phenomene recurrent en pays soninke. Les graves crises alimentaires sont neanmoins vecues comme des echecs et des periodes de grande perturbation, susceptibles de remettre en cause l'ordre socio-politique. Pour survivre, les membres des familles nobles peuvent en effet etre amenes a avoir des comportements reserves habituellement aux gens de metiers ou aux esclaves. Avec le risque de perdre leur position sociale, ce qui explique leur reticence a evoquer par la suite ces annees difficiles. Les famines sont cependant mises en avant dans certaines sources orales, telles que chants et recits historiques. Elles peuvent alors souligner les liens entre detention de nourriture et pouvoir politique ou religieux. Dans d'autres cas, la reference a une periode de famine, tout en ayant une part de realite, peut servir aussi a masquer un rapport de forces defavorable, qu'il s'agisse de la periode precoloniale ou des debuts de la conquete francaise. A travers differentes evocations du probleme des subsistances, ces traditions orales expriment des enjeux politiques et sociaux ainsi qu'un certain rapport a l'histoire.",

      "abstract": "A person's mental health and many common mental disorders are shaped by various social, economic, and physical environments operating at different stages of life. Risk factors for many common mental disorders are heavily associated with social inequalities, whereby the greater the inequality the higher the inequality in risk. The poor and disadvantaged suffer disproportionately, but those in the middle of the social gradient are also affected. It is of major importance that action is taken to improve the conditions of everyday life, beginning before birth and progressing into early childhood, older childhood and adolescence, during family building and working ages, and through to older age. Action throughout these life stages would provide opportunities for both improving population mental health, and for reducing risk of those mental disorders that are associated with social inequalities. As mental disorders are fundamentally linked to a number of other physical health conditions, these actions would also reduce inequalities in physical health and improve health overall. Action needs to be universal: across the whole of society and proportionate to need. Policy-making at all levels of governance and across sectors can make a positive difference.",

      "title": "The Great Illusion: Ignorance, Informational Cascades, and the Persistence of Unpopular Norms",
      "abstract": "Norms of discrimination against women and blacks, norms of revenge still alive in some Mediterranean countries, and norms that everybody dislikes and tries to circumvent, such as the invisible norms of reciprocity that hold among the Iks studied by Turnbull, are all examples of unpopular and inefficient norms that often persist in spite of their being disliked as well as being obviously inefficient from a social or economic viewpoint. The world of business is not immune to this problem. In all those countries in which corruption is endemic, bribing public officials to get lucrative contracts is the norm, but it is often true that such a norm is disliked by many, and that it may lead to highly inefficient social outcomes (Bicchieri and Rovelli 1995). From a functionalist viewpoint such norms are anomalous, since they do not seem to fulfill any beneficial role for society at large or even for the social groups involved in sustaining the norm. In many cases it would be possible to gain in efficiency by eliminating, say, norms of racial discrimination, in that it would be possible to increase the well-being of a racial minority without harming the rest of society. To social scientists who equate persistence with efficiency, the permanence of inefficient norms thus presents an anomaly. They rest their case on two claims: when a norm is inefficient, sooner or later this fact will become evident. And evidence of inefficiency will induce quick changes in the individual choices that sustain the norm. That is, no opportunity for social improvement remains unexploited for long. Unfortunately, all too often this is not the case, and this is not because people mistakenly believe inefficient norms to be good or efficient.",

Take, for example, the resurrection of Hebrew as a lingua franca in multicultural Israel, the role of French in Quebecois separation, and the revival of Catalan in Spain. Yet beyond nationalist and ethnic arenas, forms of language (e.g., dialect, nonverbals, and discourse) play key roles in virtually all intergroup situations—as evident in adolescents' distinctive speech styles, patronizing ways of addressing and referring to older adults and those physically challenged, gay expressions and tone of voice, and so forth (see Clément, 1996). In fact, intergroup processes have become core foci in the social psychology of language, as witnessed by their frequent occurrence across many different chapters of The New Handbook of Language and Social Psychology (Robinson &amp; Giles, 2001), and language and communication issues have, in turn, featured prominently in the study of intergroup relations (Kashima, Fielder, &amp; Freytag, 2007; Reid &amp; Giles, 2005).",

This can be interpreted as a modern form of the traditional patronage as a social institution of supporting arts. Despite the apparent similarity of the external features of the traditional patronage and some forms of social responsibility of business, value-motivational aspects of such business initiatives remain unclear for researchers.

Indeed, nearly all studies of social movements include some acknowledgement or discussion of the role of leadership in relation to, for example, recruitment, mobilization, or the achievement of goals. Rather, the area suffers from weak theoretical development, and a general failure to place leaders and leadership at the center of the analysis. Leadership is often tangential to analyses of social movement development, goals, tactics, and outcomes. Until recently, leadership has been treated as a structurally or socially constituted dependent variable, thus we know little about its independent effect on social movements.",

From the real proves of usage taken along the fieldwork that we have carried out with the scholastic community of the Public School «Es Puig» from Sóller (Balearic-Isles) we have obtained series of phonetics features which show us a remarkable influence of Catalan language patterns over Castilian, in this linguistic community. This linguistic features move away from the standard of Castilian in other geographical areas; they are provoked by the environmental bilingualism which exists in the Balearic Community and present a great vitality stimulated by the progressive social normalization of Catalan language, which reach the acceptation of many of them by the non-bilingual Balearic Community.",

      "title": "On the importance of sport as political action: Reasons and governance measures",
      "abstract": "Abstract As acknowledged in the Comision Europea (2007) White Paper on Sport, sport can be understood as “all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.” (2007, p. 2). Thus, considering that sport is a social phenomenon of enormous dimensions, the absence of public debate on sport policy results remarkable, especially when compared with the ideological exchange aroused by other areas of culture or education. Let’s recall, for example, the social discussion produced by the introduction of the subject Education for Citizenship and Human Rights in the educational system. In sharp contrast, without considering if it is positive or negative, advisable or inadvisable, when one talks about sport, it is usually from the position of a spectator, a practicing amateur, or a professional involved in sports as a journalist or technician, but it is unusual, with a few exceptions, to approach sport from a political standpoint. This will not be the case this Editorial, where four reasons will be presented as to why sport should be a fundamental line of political action, while postulating governance measures in regards to sport policy. Accordingly, it is worth noting that it is not the writer’s objective to politicize sport in the sense of promoting a partisan use of it, but to emphasize what sport can do positively for the development of peoples, in this case the Spanish people. === Resumen Como hiciera el Libro Blanco para el Deporte de la Comision Europea (2007), el deporte puede ser entendido como “cualquier forma de actividad fisica que, a traves de participacion organizada o no, tiene por objeto la expresion o mejoria de la condicion fisica y psiquica, el desarrollo de las relaciones sociales o la obtencion de resultados en competicion a todos los niveles” (2007, p. 2). Asi, pese a que el deporte es un hecho social de enormes dimensiones, llama la atencion la ausencia de debate publico sobre politica y deporte, especialmente si se compara con el intercambio ideologico que suscitan otras areas de la cultura o de la educacion. Recordemos, por ejemplo, la discusion social que supuso la implantacion en el sistema educativo de la materia Educacion para la Ciudadania y los Derechos Humanos. En agudo contraste, sin llegar a valorar si es positivo o negativo, aconsejable o desaconsejable, cuando se habla de deporte, generalmente se hace desde posicionamientos de espectador, de aficionado practicante o de profesionales vinculados al deporte como periodistas o tecnicos, pero no es habitual, salvo excepciones, abordarlo desde un enfoque politico. No sera el caso de este Editorial, donde se expondran cuatro razones de por que el deporte debe ser una linea fundamental de accion politica, a la vez que se postulan medidas de gobernanza en materia de politica deportiva. Al respecto, cabe destacar que la voluntad de quien escribe no es politizar el deporte en el sentido de promover un uso partidista del mismo, sino poner de relieve lo que el deporte puede hacer positivamente por el desarrollo de los pueblos, en este caso el espanol.",

      "abstract": "Despite the clearly specified conditions laid down in the Slovenian Local Self-Government Act, both in theory and practice, the question often arises whether or not the Slovene municipalities are able to perform original tasks. In this regard, it must be noted that the local communities, i.e., municipalities and wider self-governing local communities, are not formed on the basis of certain criteria of rationality according to which it would be possible to prejudge whether or not they are capable of performing the tasks that they must perform, namely, the local public services. Today's municipalities are mostly the result of the historical development, traditions, political compromises, geographical and other factors that have nothing to do with the criteria of rationality with regard to the tasks and needs they must carry out and satisfy. Due to a large number of relatively weak local communities in Slovenia, the cooperation between them is important in carrying out the functions that are common to municipalities, to the state or to the EU. It is about public-public partnerships where local communities can play a key role because they know the needs of the local population.&#x0D; &#x0D; KEYWORDS: • local authorities • local self-government • joint tasks public-public partnership • Slovenia",

However these policies or guidelines in some cases are unrelated to the specific conditions of the nation in which it is applied. This situation implies the need to adapt the suggested development policies, to local conditions of the country in which they are applied, and moreover, it is required to adapt them to the social reality of the regional space, where will be carried out. However, it is not easy to achieve this as it requires involving different «actors» that in many cases, tend to disagree: the population that will be affected or impacted in any way by the implementation; levels of Government involved (federal, state, municipal); agencies or bodies that develop or supervise the work (this implies both government agencies and private contractors) international funding agencies and interests.",

      "title": "Selves as Solutions to Social Inequalities: Why Engaging the Full Complexity of Social Identities is Critical to Addressing Disparities",
      "abstract": "Social disparities tied to social group membership(s) are prevalent and persistent within mainstream institutions (e.g., schools/workplaces). Accordingly, psychological science has harnessed selves - which are malleable and meaningfully shaped by social group membership(s) - as solutions to inequality. We propose and review evidence that theoretical and applied impacts of leveraging 'selves as solutions' can be furthered through the use of a stigma and strengths framework. Specifically, this framework conceptualizes selves in their fuller complexity, allowing the same social group membership to be associated with stigma, risk, and devaluation as well as strengths, resilience, and pride. We provide evidence that by enacting policies and practices that (a) reduce/minimize stigma and (b) recognize/include strengths, mainstream institutions can more fully mitigate social disparities tied to inclusion, achievement and well-being. Using social groups that vary in status/power we examine implications of this framework including the potential to foster positive, recursive, and intergroup impacts on social inequalities.",

      "abstract": "The question of the so-called “dark side of communication” embraces a variety of communication practices and concepts, ranging from “dark public relations”, “dark intercultural communication” to “dark side of social media”. This seems to be at the cornerstone of growing interests in our disciplines, for PR and communication practitioners as well as the civil society actors, all debate the opacity of public relations and organizational communication practices (Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Proctor, 2012). Likewise, organizational communication and public relations researchers across countries and communication research traditions are questioning topics like “communication on sensitive subjects” (Libaert, 2006 & 2013), “crisis communication” and its limits (Heath & O’Hair, 2010; Johansen, Aggerholm, and Frandsen, 2012), lobbying abuses (Arboit, 2006) and organizational communication malpractices (i.e. lies) (Vaughan, 1999; Benoit, 2003). Moreover, international communication conferences on the “dark side” or “boundaries” of communication are organized with interdisciplinary and bridging perspectives on this topic in France: “darkside-2019: le « cote obscur » de la communication des organisations” (Org&Co, 2019) or in Danemark: “The Dark Side of Communication” (Aalborg, 2019). How can we explain this convergence of research questioning both the ethical and theoretical boundaries of our field of research?",

      "abstract": "While nearly 20 years of public communication about climate change has undoubtedly raised international awareness and concern, large-scale behavioural change has not followed. The aim of the current paper is therefore twofold, namely; (a) to provide an extensive review of the theoretical and empirical evidence on which past and current climate change campaigns are based and (b) to advance a new communication model. With regard to the former, it is argued that the evolution of public climate change campaigns can be delineated according to the following typology; (1) 'the cognitiveanalytical type', (2) the 'affective-experiential type' and (3) 'the social-normative type'. In addition, three major explanations are offered for the relative ineffectiveness of past campaigns: (a) while human behaviour is often the result of complexly integrated behavioural processes, most public climate change campaigns ought to be, but are unfortunately not, designed in an integrative manner, (b) public campaigns do not pay sufficient attention to the psychological determinants of the behaviours that they are trying to change and (c) often fail to make the climate change context explicit. Based on these shortcomings, an integrated conceptual framework is advanced to guide the design of future public interventions and to help narrow the gap between communicating climate change and changing individual behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The self, in late modern societies, is expressed as fl uid abstraction, reifi ed through the individual's association with a reality that may be equally fl exible. The process of self presentation becomes an ever-evolving cycle through which individual identity is presented, compared, adjusted, or defended against a constellation of social, cultural, economic, or political realities. Goff man (1959) described this as an information game; \"a potentially infi - nite cycle of concealment, discovery, false revelation, and rediscovery\" (p. 13). This somewhat ego-centered approach has been related by other sociologists to contemporary historical developments, which render the self more liquid (Baumann, 2000; 2005), refl exive (Giddens, 1991), or self-identity a process (Jenkins, 2004). Self-identity in public and private life thus traverses distinct yet connected planes of interaction or networks. Technology may provide the stage for this interaction, linking the individual, separately or simultaneously, with multiple audiences. Online social networks constitute such sites of self presentation and identity negotiation. This paper focuses on what it means to present the self in online networked environments.",

The word \"company\" derives by the two Latin words \"cum\" and \"pains\" , that mean \"to share the food together\". Despite the negative sides and distortions, this term lately , is translated by the result of a widely usage as an instrument for the public relations (PR). CSR represents the idea of an ethical organization, that has social obligations and that can take responsibilities as the individuals can do. The high rhythm of the technological advances,services and new products that change in a constantly way the needs and desires, the innovative ideas, the similarities and the business requests to exceed and the consumer's expectations. All these factors that contribute for the crossing of a society oriented in goods into a society oriented in persons. The lack or the absence of realization and the sense of the cause, the weak role of society in relations take and give to the CSR's business and the legal frame in equation to support the increase of community's commitment are the factors which contribute in the concentration of the CSR on the business side. In developed countries the business should take the direction and involve operations with social commitment and manners. Meanwhile the governments should behave like a \"laissez faire\" to encourage the civil orientation and the consumption interests groups.",

Or dans le cas francais au moins, force est de constater que les acteurs des relations sociales demeurent structures sur un mode sectoriel et centralise, alors que l'intervention du politique promeut toujours davantage les logiques territoriales, la transversalite et le decloisonnement des systemes d'action. De nombreuses observations empiriques realisees depuis une dizaine d'annees montrent cependant une certaine tendance a la territorialisation du dialogue social. Mais ce mouvement est d'intensite variable selon les espaces de dialogue social consideres, comme l'est sa capacite a remettre en cause le caractere sectoriel des logiques d'action, des organisations et des regulations etablies. La ou le dialogue social est le plus autonome et producteur de normes (dans l'espace de la negociation collective) les dynamiques sectorielles resistent encore tres fortement aux logiques territoriales. A contrario, plus le dialogue social est partie integrante de l'action publique (en fonctionnant comme cadre procedural de cooperation davantage que comme source de production normative), plus il tend a s'inscrire dans des dynamiques territoriales emergentes. Dans cet espace institutionnel intermediaire qu'est le paritarisme, cette inflexion vers le territoire prend surtout la forme d'une simple territorialisation de structures et d'appareils sectorises et centralises.",

      "abstract": "Change occurs at all times. However, current changes are accompanied by an unprecedented dynamism and complexity. It is a consequence of an enormous and increasing rate at which new developments emerge, developments with a global nature that are also completely interwoven with the local environment, such as the internet, social media, economic uncertainty and the energy transition. The interconnectedness of these processes is only increasing, and their dynamics have an unstoppable effect on almost everything. Societal processes are part of a dynamism in which connections that are deemed relevant, the intended approaches and the targeted processes that were embraced yesterday and still feel familiar today, could very well be entirely outdated by tomorrow. These are the circumstances that spatial planning is confronted with. Planning can no longer afford to ignore fundamental uncertainties. Key is how planning can relate to change in a way that is different from before. Adaptivity is often mentioned as the answer to increasing uncertainty, societal dynamism and spatial transformation. It is then about the way in which planning is able to respond to unforeseen, autonomous or spontaneously occurring changes (acting in response to change), the way in which planning is able to influence such changes (addressing the possibility to change) and how planning may increase the options for dealing with change (capacity to perform in moments of change). Based on this distinction, various forms of adaptive planning will be presented that together offer a world of planning opportunities.",

In contrast, our work examines adaptive features of authoritarianism. Evolutionary game theoretical considerations (e.g., biased social learning) point to authoritarian psychological processes that establish and foster group life (e.g., high levels of ingroup cooperation). First, the evolution of social learning (particularly conformist and prestige biases) leads to the establishment of local and distinct cultural groups (conventionalism). Second, local cultural rules solve coordination dilemmas by transforming these rules into normative standards against which others are evaluated (authoritarian submission). Third, the common rules within a particular culture or group are reinforced by a tendency to reward norm compliance and punish norm deviations (authoritarian aggression). Implications regarding the deduction of novel research questions as well as dealing with authoritarianism as a social problem are discussed.",

Questa diffusa sensibilizzazione in concomitanza con l’insorgere di specifici bisogni, ha fatto si che non rimangano piu “solo” una proposta quegli accordi che sono oggi per la Categoria, per la Psicologia dell’Emergenza e per la collettivita una vera e propria norma per il Supporto Psicosociale nelle catastrofi. La psicologia dell’emergenza si occupa di preparare ad affrontare tali situazioni come aiuto alla persona ed alla societa nel suo complesso. I danni psicologici provocati dal sottosviluppo, dalle catastrofi naturali o dalle guerre agli individui e alle comunita, ma anche dall’esasperazione delle situazioni di prossimita con culture ed abitudini altre, alla difficolta di elaborare risposte riadattive ai contesti/eventi quotidiani considerati critici, non sono meno importanti di quelli di ordine sociale, igienico - sanitario, nutrizionale o abitativo. E dunque necessario per gli psicologi attrezzarsi di un repertorio specifico di conoscenze e di competenze che li metta in grado di affrontare in modo professionalmente adeguato i compiti complessi che sono chiamati a svolgere nei contesti locali, nazionali ed internazionali. La sinergia che si creerebbe formando gruppi misti di soccorritori, psicologi e vigili del fuoco, potrebbe apportare una ricchezza non solo di competenze ma anche di relazioni che nel momento operativo rappresenterebbero una risorsa ineguagliabile.

These changes can be formal, leading to a change in law; they can also be informal, resulting in an alternative set of social norms. In contrast to social movements, social mobilization is intermittent and transient by nature. As an integral part of a social movement, however, social mobilization helps build a sense of solidarity, identity, and public awareness that supports a cause. Social mobilization can be legitimized by a political institution, including a government. It can also be used to challenge the moral authority and political legitimacy of an institution. In short, social mobilization provides a means for a social movement to achieve its goals. The mere presence of some forms of social mobilization is not a suffi cient proof of the existence of a social movement. However, no social movement can exist without some visible forms of social mobilization.",

      "abstract": "Gerhard Maré Race, Nation, Democracy: Questioning Patriotism in the New South Africa Just as you cannot survive without dreams, you cannot move on without the memory of where you come from, even if that journey is fictitious. Is what we call identity not that situation made up of bits and pieces which one remembers from previous encounters, events and situa­ tions? Is memory not hanging from the branches? — BREYTEN BREYTENBACH (1998) . . . since memory, which is veiy sensitive and hates to be found lacking, tends to fill in any gaps with its own spuri­ ous creations of reality, but more or less in line with the facts of which it only has a vague recollection, like what remains after the passing of a shadow — JO SÉ SARAMAGO (2000:174). INTRODUCTION W HILE BEN ED ICT A N D ERSO N (19 8 3 ) HAD QUITE CORRECTLY DRAWN our attention to the “imagined” nature of political social identities (in particular the imagined communities that shelter under national­ ism), his phrase had also been too appropriate and soon became the new common sense. It is necessary to go beyond that common sense, social research Vol 72 : No 3 : Fall 2005 501 to see why populations are “available” (John Saul’s term [1979]) for mobilization, and not just investigate the methods through which that community is called into being, is mobilized, or imagined. Bowman, in a provocative contribution on Palestine and the imagined commu­ nity of Palestinians, argues that “the reader [of print media which, in Anderson’s argument, calls upon its mass audience] does not . . . ‘find’ a national identity through imagining a simultaneity of thou­ sands (or millions) of others who are reading the same text at the same time. Instead, a national identity is constituted by discovering a set of concerns he or she ‘recognizes’ as his or her own within a text or texts” (1994:141, emphasis added). Shared memories would be one set of such discoveries, even if only “more or less in line with the facts.” What do South Africans recognize after the transition to an inclu­ sive democratic order and within the common call to “build a nation” after 1994? Here lies my quest in this paper, asking whether the “nation” is feasible or even desirable: asking whether there are not more appro­ priate recognitions that can provide social cohesion. My argument is that the notion of a South African nation is tenuous at best, but that there are in any case more promising social commitments. In South Africa, since 1994, the call for “nation-building” has become familiar in many political discourses. This is not surprising in a country that had to create the new out of the fragments created by apartheid: fragments of ethnic “homelands” and divisions of “race,” certainly, but also of gender and of massive inequality, and of a labor exploitation system that relied on the “oscillating” migration of hundreds of thousands every year. However, the process of finding the most adequate and achievable form of “nation” has not been that easy and is far from realized, and here memory (also in the fleeting forms indicated by Breytenbach and Saramago), but also, and even more important, the material traces and scars of the past, are pertinent. How do these elements—race, nation, democracy, exploitation, and patriotism for that matter—relate to each other in this unusual context, a society in transition for a decade now: a society that was not colonial, in the strict sense, but sometimes characterized as “colonial­ 502 social research ism of a special type”; a society that was democratic, but for a very small proportion of the total population; a society that had been deliberately isolated, from within and without, and which was suddenly thrust into a world already transformed by processes of globalization and by the collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellites, effectively remov­ ing whatever options toward socialism that would otherwise have been considered in the transition? In this “new world” these elements are deliberately addressed at the local, the South African level, through policy and political discourse in a nation-state that both exists, as state, and has still to be created, as nation.

Public opinion bears a sort of syntactical internal contradiction: While “public” denotes the group and the universal, “opinion” on its own is typically associated with the individual and considered a somewhat internal, subjective formulation. The rise of survey research during the early twentieth century further complicated matters with a trend toward quantifying public opinion as a simple aggregation of individual survey responses (→ Survey; Public Opinion Polling). The rejection of such mathematical reductions – along with the suggestion that public opinion was in fact a group‐level social force iteratively constructed through interpersonal interaction and media use (→ Interpersonal Communication; Political Media Use; Media Use by Social Variable) – set the stage for a social science debate that has continued for well over 50 years.",

Son prestaciones que adicionan valor agregado directa o indirectamente a otra persona o a un bien que pertenece a otra persona. A diferencia de los bienes, son intangibles e invisibles, no son almacenables, y para la mayoría de los servicios involucran una acción simultánea entre el proveedor y el consumidor. La propiedad no es transferida durante el proceso de provisión del servicio, el productor mantiene la capacidad de proveer el servicio en el punto en el tiempo en el que se demande el servicio.English Abstract: In a modern society, services are not seen, they are present in much of the activities that are carried out and play a major role in the economic development and well-being of individuals.

Cualquiera sea el escenario es importante contar con una fuente de financiamiento publica o privada que coadyuve a alcanzar el objetivo propuesto; por otra parte, la banca, dada su naturaleza tiende a generar instrumentos para personas, asociaciones o proyectos que estan ampliamente referenciados o definidos y cuyo fin se dirija mas hacia la expansion de un proyecto, cuyo financiamiento se extienda a los mas a tres (03) anos, con lo cual, la figura de los microproyectos pareciera que excluida de las posibilidades de atencion a sus necesidades de financiamiento. Ahora bien, cuando caracterizamos un microproyecto, se le entiende como un conjunto de actividades cuya finalidad es dar solucion a un problema local (generalmente los microproyectos, esta enfocados en un canton especifico), en la generalidad de los casos estos proyectos estan llamados a resolver problemas de caracter comunitario (lo cual no excluye el aspecto productivo) por tanto, comunmente generan beneficios no monetarios, todo lo anterior, plantea un escenario restrictivo a la hora de acudir a la banca. Realizando un sondeo rapido por las opciones de financiamiento de los principales bancos del pais (banca publica y privada), se observa que el financiamiento disponible, esta dirigido a proyectos medianos o emprendimientos que cuentan con cierto musculo financiero que les permite iniciar funciones y que con la ayuda de la banca alcanzaran su objetivo, es decir, es escasa la oferta de financiamiento a proyectos que por su dimension deben iniciar desde cero.",

      "abstract": "The term of “innovation” has become increasingly frequent as people begin to recognize both the need for fundamental change in human beings’ relationships with each other and their environment. This paper wants to bring up also the complexity theory matter in order for us to be able to build a connection between innovation and complex adaptive social systems. The critical question is whether and how social networks can help facilitate innovations to bridge the seemingly insurmountable chasms that separate local solutions from broad system transformation; that is, how they help innovations to “cross scales”. Using a complexity lens to understand the meta challenges confronting the world, and applying a social innovation framework to illuminate how local novelty spreads so as to have broad system impacts, this paper proposes that institutional entrepreneurship enhances the understanding of agency that is active within networks. The Public sector adopts strategies for dealing with complexity, therefore, focuses on outcomes (rather than inputs and outputs) that are demonstrable and measurable (even if only qualitatively), collaboration and co-ordination (across sectors, fields, organizational boundaries etc.), decentralization and self organization (by increasing decision making powers of local communities), building adaptive capacity (in order to support decentralization and self-organization and build resilience).",

      "title": "Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action",
      "abstract": "The contemporary moment is characterized by unmet challenges both in theory and practice. The processes of change at work in individual social systems as well as interaction among different societies in the global ecumene bring to the fore the unfinished task lying before us with regard to moral consciousness and communicative action. Now because of globalization, as \"moral issues stemming from cultural diversity ... that used to arise mainly between societies now increasingly arise within them\" (Geertz 1986: 115), the nature of interaction between different cultures with widely variant moral standards and the development of a critical reflective consciousness on the part of the actors where moral issues are not easily disposed of either through a convenient relativism or universalism is an epochal challenge before us. Similar is the task when we come to individual social systems as they are characterized by pervasive structural differentiations and as in these societies \"morality gets no clear status in the construction of a structurally differentiated life world\" (Habermas 1987a: 92). A related issue here is the unprecedented crisis of institutions including media institutions that characterize individual social systems to cope with the contemporary dynamics of change in self, society, and culture. For many insightful critics, our contemporary dilemmas are also significantly institutional, in as much as they spring from the irrelevance of existing institutions and lack of availability of new institutions to guide our private lives and the public sphere. These institutional dilemmas are primarily \"moral dilemmas\" (Bellah et al. 1991: 38) which call for a new moral language to think about our institutions as they are now ridden with \"unprecedented problems\" (Bellah et al. 1991: 42). For instance, reflecting on contemporary American society Robert Bellah and his colleagues argue that in the face of the challenge of the present and the dislocations of the post-industrial transition there is an urgency to think of \"democracy as an ongoing moral quest,\" not simply as a political process – \"as an end state\" (Bellah et al. 1991: 20). They are emphatic in their proposition that we currently need a new \"moral ecology\" to think creatively about institutions – their predicament and possibility since \"the decisions that are made about our economy, our schools, our government, of our national position in the world cannot be separated from the way we live in practical terms, the moral life we lead as a people\" (Bellah et al. 1991: 42; emphasis added).",

      "abstract": "The evolutionary dynamics of social traits depend crucially on the social structure of a population. The effects of social structure on social behaviors are well-studied, but relatively little is known about how social structure itself coevolves with social traits. Here, I study such coevolution with a simple yet realistic model of within-group social structure where social connections are either inherited from a parent or made randomly. I show that cooperation evolves when individuals make few random connections, but the presence of cooperation selects for increased rates of random connections, which leads to its collapse. Inherent costs of social connections can prevent this negative feedback, but these costs can negate some or all of the aggregate benefits of cooperation. Exogenously maintained social inheritance can mitigate the latter problem and allow cooperation to increase the average fitness of a population. These results illustrate how coevolutionary dynamics can constrain the long-term persistence of cooperation.",

Expressing concern about certain conditions in a society is perceived as a threat to those values and interests – that is, to the power structure in society. To maintain the legitimacy of those values and interests, the power holders seek to remove social problems from the social sphere either by shifting them through explanation or deliberate action to places and forces beyond the control of the state, or by relating such problems through residualist conversion to the characteristics of the population strata experiencing them. Sometimes, a problem may remain in both the public and private spheres, its position being contested by parties with conflicting interests, according to their respective perceptions and interpretations. For example, unemployment has been explained by government policy, by unfair competition from other countries, or by the influence of some imported films or fashions being reflected in young people's ‘disruptive’ social behaviour and unwillingness to accept the discipline of formal and sustained employment obligations. Once a social problem is effectively located in a particular population group, it may further serve to maintain the legitimacy of those dominant values and interests by being used as an illustration of the penalty suffered by those who ‘fail’ to actively pursue the dominant values and corresponding goals.",

The tendency to tolerate the other also seems obvious and for these reasons, marital solidarity has many functional problems. In the common culture, the conflict is equivalent to scandal, so often the tendency to avoid the conflict is a priority to mediate the conflictual situation. At the same time, in the process of self-mediation, a priority effort tends to be to look for the guilty one and, at the same time, to dominate the mediation process. And because a certain set of tips already seems socially validated (\"Communicate better!\"), many couples end up mediating the effects of the conflict, not the state of the conflict itself. The study aims to analyze the opinions on the strategy of self-management of the conflict within the couple, based on a qualitative research, the research tool being the semi-structured interview.",

Building on the theoretical framework of symbolic interaction, this article explores how the concept of impression management during social interaction can help understand NRM conflicts. A qualitative study was carried out on a Swedish case involving a conflict over clear-cutting of a forest. To explain why the conflict escalated and destructivity increased, we investigated how the involved actors interpreted each other’s actions. For an individual, role confusion occurs when a particular interaction creates a conflict between the presented self and the self expected from the social situation (Goffman 1956). The analysis shows that actors could not use\r\ntheir established social arenas to address dissatisfaction due to the fear of role confusion. Instead, they avoided informal face-to-face meetings and changed the conditions of the social situation to avoid role confusion.",

      "title": "Brain Mechanisms in the Typical and Atypical Development of Social Cognition",
      "abstract": "DEFINING SOCIAL COGNITION Definitions of social cognition are diverse and wide ranging. Therefore, we look to various scientific disciplines to delineate this multidisciplinary construct. Social psychologists generally describe social cognition as a range of phenomena including moral reasoning, attitude formation, stereotyping, and related topics (Kunda, 1999). This may include the processes underlying the perception, memory, and judgment of social stimuli, the effects of social, cultural, or affective factors on the processing of information, or even the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of these cognitive processes. In developmental psychology, the depiction of social cognition and its development has focused most frequently upon the study of \"theory of mind,\" the awareness that other individuals maintain thoughts, beliefs, and desires that are different from our own and that their actions can be explained with reference to their individual mental states (Premack & Woodruff, 1978; Frith & Frith, 1999). The discipline of neuroscience, however, defines social cognition more narrowly. Neuroscientists tend to view this versatile construct as the ability to perceive the intentions, actions, and dispositions of others (Brothers, 1990). In this chapter, we use the termsocial cognition to refer to the fundamental abilities to perceive, categorize, remember, analyze, reason with, and behave toward other conspecifics (Adolphs, 2001; Pelphrey, Adolphs, & Morris, 2004).",

      "title": "Social Welfare Policy and Politics",
      "abstract": "The statement \"Policy affects practice and practice affects policy\" helps educate and remind social workers of the dual role they play—practitioners, working with individuals, groups, organizations, and communities to improve currently occurring difficulties, and advocates, working through political means to alter or remove the causes of current problems. Working both in the present and for the future places social workers in a unique position. Still, the connections between social welfare policy and the political world are not always well explained or understood. This essay defines basic terms, presents a range of political philosophies, and shows how their adherents operationalize their view of the \"ideal\" social policy. A brief description of the process of politics, advocacy, is also provided, in the context of the generalist model of social work practice. Social welfare policy, a complex and ill-defined term, has three important characteristics: it relates to enhancing the quality of life of individuals, sometimes acting through groups or communities to do so; it is created by both action and lack of action on the part of decision-makers; and it is the outcome of a process involving politics. Politics, as a term, has two separate meanings which are both explored. First is politics as ideology, or a view or how the world does or should operate. Second, politics is also a process that is used to create, defend, or change social welfare and other types of policy. A spectrum of ideologies and their associated policy implications are presented. Starting with libertarians, on the right, we move leftward, looking at conservatives, centrists, liberals, social democrats, and socialists. The connection between politics as ideology and social welfare policy is made clear by showing the variation in desired policies, depending on the ideology used for their justification. Following the discussion of politics as ideology, we turn to politics as process. Advocacy in the political world is broken into six steps that anyone can follow, modeled after the steps in the generalist, problem-solving model of social work. These steps are: getting involved, understanding the issue, planning, advocating, evaluating, and monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Much of the literature on international democratic diffusion appeals to mechanisms—competition, learning, emulation or socialization, and coercion—that typically are treated as competing and theoretically separate. All four, however, fit within a coevolutionary framework, that is, one integrating the concepts of variety, retention, and selection of traits (in this case, regime type). Competition, learning, and emulation are not mutually exclusive and all find support in the large literature on cultural and social evolution. Coercion may seem anti-evolutionary, inasmuch as it implies design and implementation by a powerful rational actor (state, international institution, etc.), but <italic>co-evolution</italic> can accommodate coercion as well. In co-evolution, agent and environment evolve together: an agent shapes its environment (engages in niche construction), and that reshaped environment alters the fitness of the agents’ traits. A powerful democracy can alter its social and material environment so as to increase the fitness of its own regime. Co-evolution can provide a framework to integrate mechanisms by which democracy and other regime types spread and contract across time and space, and hence can aid empirical research on the effects of global power shifts, including the rise of China, on the fate of democracy in various regions around the world.",

      "title": "English) The Relational Know for a New Configuration of Civil Society (Italiano) Il sapere relazionale per una nuova configurazione della società civile",
      "abstract": "(English) The changing contexts and their complexity has placed the need to start thinking about social innovation actions that have the capacity to provide social responses to the real needs of citizens with sharing and participation of all social actors. The sharing and participation are two processes that cannot be separated from the social relations that constitute the mutual action of the people, and from which develops the order of reality which requires an act of mediation (social reflexivity) between human subjectivity and social systems. The social reflexivity, however, is not sufficient for the emergence of the “relational know” – knowledge about what you do, you think, and is experienced in a relational context – as “emergent effect” of the interactions between specific forms of “being” and “doing” of people. In fact, the social reflexivity needs to be transformed into “relational reflexivity”. These processes allow the emergence of a “relational know” that directs the action towards social innovation of a civil society. The civil society does not configure more as a “rights” but also a “duty”. (Italiano) I mutamenti dei contesti e la loro complessita ha posto la necessita di iniziare a pensare a interventi di innovazione sociale che hanno la capacita di fornire risposte sociali alle reali esigenze dei cittadini con la condivisione e la partecipazione di tutti gli attori sociali. La condivisione e la partecipazione sono due processi che non possono essere separati dalle relazioni sociali che caratterizzano l’azione reciproca delle persone, e dalla quale si sviluppa l’ordine di realta che richiede un atto di mediazione (riflessivita sociale) tra la soggettivita umana e sistemi sociali. La riflessivita sociale, tuttavia, non e sufficiente per la nascita della “sapere relazionale” - conoscenza di cio che si fa, si pensa, ed e vissuta in un contesto relazionale - come “effetto emergenti” delle interazioni tra specifiche forme di “essere”e “fare” delle persone. Infatti, la riflessivita sociale deve essere trasformata in “riflessivita relazionale”. Questi processi permettono l’emergere di un “sapere relazionale” che dirige l’azione verso l’innovazione sociale di una societa civile. La societa civile non si configura piu come un “diritto”, ma anche un “dovere”.",

      "title": "How Employment Generates Social Integration: Trends Towards Disintegration and Over-Integration in the Hyper-Work Society",
      "abstract": "Abstract Using an analytical framework that further develops Jahoda’s ideas and distinguishes between two manifest and five latent mechanisms for the production of employment-based social integration, three research questions are examined: How does employment generate social integration in German welfare capitalism? How have these employment-based integration mechanisms changed in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) since the Second World War? What dangers to social integration can be identified because of these changes? The manifest mechanisms establish socio-economic integration directly via employment or indirectly through de-commodifying welfare state interventions. The latent mechanisms ensure that social relationships can be formed by providing a time structure, extending social contacts, enabling participation in collective goals, offering collective identities and activating people. We analyse different social orders at the macro-level (labour and social legislation), meso-level (company structures, industrial relations, work environments) and micro-level (employment relationships, household models, action orientations, subjective identifications) of society to identify conditions that promote or endanger social integration. On the one hand, the danger of over-integration (reflected in the term “hyper-work society”), which arises from generalising employment-related performance and exploitation criteria, erects integration barriers for other forms of social integration beyond employment because alternative premises for organising one’s life are devalued by predominantly adopting capitalist criteria of social recognition. On the other hand, the binding power of employment and the integrative power of workplaces are weakened by disintegrative trends such as insecure employment, blurring organisational boundaries, as well as fragmentation of employment and social relations, jeopardising social integration through employment.",

      "abstract": "A new approach for the description of phenomena of social aggregation is suggested. On the basis of psychological concepts (as for instance social norms and cultural coordinates), we deduce a general mechanism for the social aggregation in which different clusters of individuals can merge according to the cooperation among the agents. In their turn, the agents can cooperate or defect according to the clusters distribution inside the system. The fitness of an individual increases with the size of its cluster, but decreases with the work the individual had to do in order to join it. In order to test the reliability of such new approach, we introduce a couple of simple toy models with the features illustrated above. We see, from this preliminary study, how the cooperation is the most convenient strategy only in presence of very large clusters, while on the other hand it is not necessary to have one hundred percent of cooperators for reaching a totally ordered configuration with only one megacluster filling the whole system.",

      "abstract": "The problem of modern society is that it does not integrate its members into functional systems as a collectivity of individuals with a sense of community and interdependence, but makes them a group of consumers who want to achieve success on their own and for their own benefits. However, not everyone is able to achieve the desired goal. As a result, we have social inequalities that significantly affect relationships and social processes. For many years, economists and sociologists have pointed to the fact that economic success does not necessarily translate into welfare (or quality of life) of societies. They even talk about the “breakdown of society” phenomenon, i.e., an increase in antisocial behaviour and a loss of a sense of community. In the current social reality, we can identify many examples of the fact that their fears are justified. All this makes the need for educational measures to stop or even reverse these phenomena threatening social cohesion seem reasonable.",

The regulation of social relationships reflects adaptive mechanisms of deliberate acquisition, maintenance, transformation, or discontinuation of relationships within the individual's personal network. Mechanisms of relationship regulation in later life are illustrated on the individual level with recent empirical findings on social motivation. Close emotional ties are relatively stable until late in life, whereas peripheral (i.e., not close) social relationships are preferably discontinued. Such patterns of change and continuity were found to reflect individual differences in goal priorities and in future time perspectives (i.e., subjective nearness to death). Proactively molding the social world in accordance with one's age-specific needs also contributes to subjective well-being. The regulation of social relationships is proposed as a promising venue for further research in this field that may also reflect key issues in social, emotional, and cognitive aging.",

But this common-sense idea of social innovation is based on a quasi-concept, where processes of innovation are absent. To restore some academic rigour to this important concept, we argue more attention need be paid to these innovation processes in social innovation, and that there is value in using innovation concepts drawn from other areas of innovation studies (disruptive innovation, innovation systems, institutional innovation and socio-technical transitions) in highlighting how small-scale social experiments can ultimately lead to the solution of pressing societal problems. Through a subtle critique of the current policy conception of social innovation, it is possible for the field of Innovation Studies in general to help provide better insights into social innovation processes and ultimately to lead to better support frameworks and interventions for promoting solutions to these Grand Challenges.",

This is hardly surprising, since institutions play a central role in the production and maintenance of social order, and, for instance, in the allocation of services and resources to citizens. The position that the institutionality of talk can be derived from the words on the page has consequences at many levels. The local accomplishment of talk is therefore also the accomplishment of a certain moral order. The traditions of argumentation seem to work as living constitutive possibilities that enable the participants in a complex society to argue in situated practices. An institutional category in this perspective is thus characterized by a double dialogicity: it is 'dialogical' both in the contexts of in situ interaction and within the sociocultural practices established over long traditions of indulging in such interactions.",

Citizens, policy makers, social workers, schoolteachers, and politicians wrestle with these problems, and with difficult questions these issues pose: - What causes conflict to escalate? - How should we manage conflict within communities, and also in society at large? - Is conflict always bad, or does it have other more beneficial consequences? Social Conflict within and between Groups provides an overview of contemporary research from the social sciences on these questions. It brings together the research output of a number of leading researchers in psychology, management and economics, sociology and political science, and draws on the outcomes of ten prominent research programs conducted over the past five years. The chapters cover a range of fascinating topics, including prejudice and discrimination in multi-ethnic societies, and conflict and negotiation in the field of industrial relations. The authors also consider the possibilities for intervention at the interpersonal, intergroup and societal level.",

      "title": "Indigenous communication and women politics in Ado-Odo Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",
      "abstract": "IntroductionAccording to Oyesomi and Okorie (2013), effective communication which operates in a society through the mass media cannot operate in isolation; it has to operate with the society so as to reflect the needs of the people. Many of the initial assumptions that the media had enormous potential to inform the poor, rural and illiterate people about ways to act on information to improve their lives have been challenged (Hedebro, 1992). Wilbur Schramm, one of the most influential communication scholars, admits:I should have been more skeptical about the applicability of the Western model of development. I should have paid more attention to the problem of integrating mass media with local activity. Above all, I should have given more thought than I did to the social requirements and uncertainties of development and in particular to the cultural differences that make development almost necessarily different, culture to culture, country to country (Mante, 1999, p.221).Attempts to address these concerns have led to an approach to development communication characterised by an emphasis on self-reliance, grassroots participation and productive use of local resources. Indigenous communication, as defined by Obeng (1992), seems to fit this new approach. It is embedded in the culture and still exists as a vital mode of communication in many parts of the world, presenting a certain degree of continuity. Indigenous communication modes include drama, dance and story-telling, etc.Several of the advantages of indigenous communication have been identified by Obeng (1992, p.30):They have credibility, particularly among rural populations, that modern media often lack. Press, radio, television and cinema are often alien and elitist in outlook, and those at the periphery of modern life tend to identify them with the centres of power. They employ the idiom of the people and are readily intelligible to them. Even the poorest have access to indigenous media, whereas radio and television may be beyond their means and newspapers beyond their comprehension. Indigenous media demand active participation in the communication process- the audience is involved rather than passive.Indigenous communication aims at the transmission of entertainment, news, persuasion, announcements, and social exchanges. It is an aspect of culture that should be respected by people. It is the means by which culture and the indigenous knowledge embedded in it is preserved, handed down, and shared. Research has quite often shown that most farmers, both male and female, do not learn about new technologies through the media or the extension services, but rather do so from their friends and neighbours or through their own experiments. Indigenous communication enjoys high credibility status because it is familiar and controlled locally. Local audiences are often sceptical of externally-controlled mass media, viewing them merely as government propaganda. Indigenous communication has a much wider audience, as it can reach those who do not read or write. It is therefore, crucial for exchange of information with those (people) who are out of the reach of external channels (Agunga, 1997).Statement of the problemIndigenous communication offers opportunities for local participation in development efforts. Its channel allows the local people to communicate among themselves and with development professionals, using forms with which they are familiar. In most local communities in Nigeria, electricity is in short supply and sometimes, the technology of reception is not readily available. If and where available, the content of the media may not facilitate women's participation in politics. Adeyokunnu (2006) posits that the use of radio and television for participation of women in politics in the rural areas has not been effective as many women do not even have access to the media.The relevance of women in the society and in politics cannot be undermined. …",

      "title": "Bringing the Crowd Back In: The Nonorganizational Elements of Social Movements*",
      "abstract": "Organizations are very important in social movements, but they are not the whole story. Social movements are exceedingly complex phenomena encompassing the actions of organizations and their members, the actions of nonmembers in activities planned by organizations, and the actions of nonmembers in activities that organizations have nothing to do with, and may even oppose. Crowds and diffuse collectivities are important parts of social movements. This essay sketches an understanding of social movements which integrates organizational and nonorganizational elements of social movements, and the relations among them. Social movements are viewed as large, complex sets of collective events oriented toward some general social change goal. These events are seen not merely as common responses to the same external stimulus, but as affecting each other and accumulating into the dynamic event we call a movement. Actions can affect the likelihood of other actions by creating occasions for action, by altering material conditions, by changing a group's social organization, by altering beliefs, or by adding knowledge. The effects of one action on another are filtered through communication networks and the mass media. Giving attention to the ways in which actions affect other actions will allow us to understand the dynamic processes involved in the growth (or lack of growth) of widespread social movements.",

      "abstract": "A networked software development effort is any software development effort that is carried out through a network of multiple, heterogeneous organizations. A core constant behind a networked software development scenario is the emergence of development communities, i.e., social networks across which certain conditions and organizational/social arrangements are constantly true, either explicitly (i.e. enforced by a managing body) or by emergence (e.g. as a consequence of contextual conditions and other emerging relations). Producing software better in these conditions means researching the organizational and social structures behind networked communities, to find means that support their key characteristics. This book offers the state of the art in organizational and social structures, investigating organizations research and social network analysis, later discussing mechanisms to support such structures for networked development.",

      "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The equality and work well-being group at the Institute for Atmospheric and&amp;amp;#160;Earth System&amp;amp;#160;Research (INAR) has comprised a list of everyday behavior patterns that we should&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;pay attention to when striving to make the workplace culture welcoming to people with diverse backgrounds. The examples in the list are&amp;amp;#160; broadly categorized&amp;amp;#160; as 1) Accept and be interested in people as multidimensional beings, restricting manifestation of fear of differences 2) Be aware of the space and time different people are taking in workplace meetings and social situations 3) Support a balance between work and private life and recovery from work equally for different genders as well as for people with different ages and family situations 4) Be aware that discussions focusing in competition, status, hierarchies, and comparing the achievements of people (those present or not present) make many people uncomfortable&amp;amp;#160; 5) Be aware that discussing people in terms of being &amp;amp;#8216;smart&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;intelligent&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;brilliant&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;genius&amp;amp;#8217; is not gender and culture neutral 6) Avoid boss-centric atmosphere where the role of the boss is to decide alone and be revered by the rest&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;5) Avoid discussing the physical appearance or capabilities of other people even if they are not present 6) In both work related discussions and when telling jokes, stories and anecdotes in social situations, keep in mind you position with respect to people present when&amp;amp;#160; choosing the content or style&amp;amp;#160; 7) Don&amp;amp;#8217;t use &amp;amp;#160;gender specific words etc as a compliment: &amp;amp;#8216;real man&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;has got balls&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;strong for a woman&amp;amp;#8217; 8) Remember to consider the language barrier(s) when a multinational set of people is present&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We recommend that the list is discussed, for example, in a departmental seminar: our approach was to have three members of the equality and work well being group perform some of the examples in the list as a dialogue, after which the audience discussed whether they have encountered something similar and how that has affected them. Afterwards, the complete list was distributed to the staff on the unit. We received encouraging feedback on the session with requests to organize similar events in the meetings of the individual INAR research groups. We want to remind that non-one is perfect, and our vision is not to construct strict foolproof rules to avoid all situations leading to feelings of discomfort. However, a little change goes a long way in making the working environment better for everyone. Opening the eyes to how other people might experience common encounters can be aided by using an externally constructed list of examples as a starting point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

An immigrant is confronted with a variety of problems, such as maintenance or change of his own cultural identity, and dealing with conflicts between different systems of values, beliefs and behavior, namely those of the mainstream society, those of his own ethnic group, and those belonging to his own personal sphere. In addition, an immigrant has to solve problems such as housing, finding adequate nutrition, often acquiring a new language, realizing his or her traditional religious practices, finding a job, dealing with immigration and other public authorities of the host society, adjusting to a different educational system, initiating new social contacts, etc. In particular the first months of an immigrant's life in a new society, while he is trying to find his way to acculturate, are experienced as stressful because adequate acculturation strategies have not yet been developed.",

      "title": "Designing Retirement Community Third Places: Attributes Impacting how Well Social Spaces are Liked and Used",
      "abstract": "Retirement years are a time of shifting social networks, in part because workplace relationships are often left behind. This is particularly detrimental for older adults because social interaction has been shown to have a greater impact on health of older adults than younger adults (Lee, Jang, Lee, Cho, &amp; Park, 2008). This positive relationship between social interaction and health outcomes underscores the importance of helping older adults establish and maintain social relationships. To support resident social interaction, Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) commonly provide spaces for social use including recreation rooms and commercial services such as cafes. Accordingly, CCRCs serve as fruitful ground to explore how social space design relates to why some spaces are popular gathering places and others are underutilized. Third places, defined by Oldenburg (1999), are lively gathering places where people can engage regularly in conversation, satisfying social needs. While Oldenburg's study provides guidance about designing third places to host quality interaction among the general population, it does not distinguish social behavior for people of different ages or living contexts. The research reported here takes steps to bridge this gap. Confirming earlier findings, this study of a CCRC's independent living residents ( n = 179) found social spaces residents characterized as having third–place atmosphere and décor characteristics were more well liked and well used than other spaces designed to promote socialization. This suggests designing CCRC social spaces with third–place characteristics may lead to more use and in turn contribute to healthier resident social lives.",

Finally, these three forms of conflict resolution are demonstrated in the game of rugby football.",

      "title": "Educational Planning: Politics, Ideology, and Development",
      "abstract": "When we begin to talk about planning in any society, we are immediately confronted with a whole range of ambiguities. First, are we talking about persuasion or prescription about the future allocation of resources in the society? Are we considering the operation of a technical sector where all issues will be decided by equations and empirical studies? Do we have adequate information about the present, much less the past and its trends or the future? Who will be actually planning for whom? These questions and many others are endemic to any consideration of the social and political environment of the polity under consideration but will also demand clear judgments about what values are important for that society as well as about the dynamics of history and change which will guide what is actually likely to happen. The conceptual difficulties involved in any sort of planning and the complexity of all societies within which one might undertake planning have combined to make me quite skeptical of most planning procedures outside of a few areas of human concern where there is no dispute about the measures of value, although even there (the market place and/or military body count) one finds room for great dispute about the values measured in relation to the goals of the larger society. This general skepticism about planning has led me to cast a cold eye on the planning processes I have observed in developing countries as well as those in which I have participated in this country. Therefore, I propose in this brief paper to raise the questions of the skeptic about planning as they apply to the particular area with which I have had some experience, that is, education, and as the processes have been manifested in countries with which I have some familiarity, in this case in Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. However, before raising these questions within the context of developing societies, I believe it is a useful exercise to see that the questions all emerge in post-industrial settings as well. Therefore, I shall begin by raising the questions in quite general terms and putting these questions in the context of one developed society—our own. Then, I shall move to a consideration of how the questions themselves might be affected by the institutional context of the developing country, and, in particular, two developing countries with very different conceptions of their present and future—Kenya and Tanzania.",

      "abstract": "Social interaction is an important—and often forgotten—aspect of conflicts in natural resource management (NRM). Building on the theoretical framework of symbolic interaction, this article explores how the concept of impression management during social interaction can help understand NRM conflicts. A qualitative study was carried out on a Swedish case involving a conflict over clear-cutting of a forest. To explain why the conflict escalated and destructivity increased, we investigated how the involved actors interpreted each other's actions. For an individual, role confusion occurs when a particular interaction creates a conflict between the presented self and the self expected from the social situation (Goffman 1956 Goffman , E. 1956 . Embarrassment and social organization . Am. J. Sociol. 62 ( 3 ): 264 – 271 .[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). The analysis shows that actors could not use their established social arenas to address dissatisfaction due to the fear of role confusion. Instead, they avoided informal face-to-face meetings and changed the conditions of the social situation to avoid role confusion.",

Esta reacción o resonancia es el origen de todos los planes habitacionales. Pero es importante tener en claro que en cada caso puede tener diferente signo y obedecer a distintas motivaciones así como puede ser experimentada por distintos protagonistas. La reacción y las acciones de respuesta que se originen en ella pueden tener como motor, objetivos genuinos de justicia social; impulsos de solidaridad social (en las muy diversas y a veces antagónicas versiones de la noción de solidaridad); nociones de orden y seguridad (también de muy variados signos, incluso los de autoritarismo extremo); objetivos de estética urbana; y también especulaciones sectoriales de los actores sociales externos: beneficios electorales, beneficios económicos, publicidad institucional, etc. Obviamente las soluciones habitacionales originadas en estas motivaciones o lo que es más frecuente, en complicadas combinaciones de motivaciones como éstas son profundamente diferentes entre sí como lo son también las consecuencias sociales de esas soluciones.&lt;/p&gt;",

This article discusses the barriers of social solidarity at various levels of Russian society. At the societal level, the formation of social solidarity prevents a high level of social economic polarization, degradation and commercialization of social sphere, the absence of value consensus on the key parameters of the development of the country. The main barrier of formation of social solidarity in the Russian society is aborted local communitarian communities. Exactly in those ones, people acquire primary skills of self-organizing and mutual aids. In the organization of collective actions in the community, vertical structures (government, state and municipal institutions) continue playing a significant role. Thus, in the territorial communities the self-organization processes – micro practices of solidarity – are actively developing. They are based on the desire to improve citizens' living environment and to help people who turned out in difficult life situations, and to a lesser extent – on defending their rights.",

      "abstract": "The concept of social cohesion is currently popular among the political establishment and the general public alike. Since the 2000s, various government and non-government institutions have been presenting the idea of social cohesion as a key benchmark of social development in their concept papers. A series of interviews was carried out to determine how and in which way general public perceives the concept of social cohesion. According to the results, general public sees social cohesion more as a regulatory trait of Russian society rather than a descriptive one. In public discourse, social cohesion is strongly connected to the common goals and interests that bring people within different groups (e.g. small communities or population as a whole) together. Social cohesion is defined as an ability of citizenry to unite in order to achieve a common goal. Shared system of values, moral and spiritual affinity along with legal and cultural identity are key components of social cohesion. In some cases social cohesion is connected to mental and behavioral traits shared by the members of society. Public discourse also presents social cohesion as an action, e. g. active assistance and support provided by the members of society to one another. Local communities with strong collective identity and highly developed communication (a village or a neighborhood in a small town) are considered to be the base of solidary society.",

The overtly individualistic framing in its most common usage—the centering of oneself for the sake of oneself—obscures power relations and structural/institutional inequalities that create the need for self‐care. To deal with difficult work or family lives, taking up a hobby or some kind of diversion offers an escape that feels good; self‐care serves as a kind of coping mechanism, but not a solution to a social problem. It also lets society, or more specifically, managers and administrators in organizations, off the hook because it places the onus on individuals to deal with challenges on their own rather than situating them as social problems. We critique shortcomings in self‐care rhetoric employed by organizations—and specifically university administrators—to their members, by extending Hochschild's economy of gratitude framework.",

Thereafter the emphasis shifts to how migrants are connected to political concerns and disputes about membership and collective purpose. Two metaphors are used: first, of glue (strong enough for everyday needs but not so strong as to discourage diverse viewpoints); and second, of sugar (people's sense that they can borrow (in the case of baking) and share with others unlike themselves).Finally, the chapter explores three prominent 'laboratories' of social cohesion: through social relations (social networks, friendships and sharing); economics (jobs and opportunity structures); and politics (the sources of political difference and common interest and mobilisation).",

      "abstract": "In important respects, European ideas of the university have spread across the world. The principal ‘philosophical’ statements on which this idea of the university is based (Humboldt and Newman) assumed the people inhabiting universities—as students—would come from the youth of a social elite. The outward-facing elements of the Bologna Process, and the European Higher Education Area, aiming mainly at promoting higher education as an export business, focus on students of similar age and social status; its internal mobility dimensions have a similar effect within Europe. The social dimension of Bologna, in contrast, aimed to open higher education more across the social spectrum—though still assuming that the principal groups enrolling would be young. Bologna’s social dimension was strongly influenced by EU debates and policy approaches: while it arguably owed its origins to this fact, the social dimension’s limited success (and more recent displacement from policy, if not rhetoric) can be put down in large part to the difficulties in encapsulating complex and contested social priorities in internationally acceptable indicators, and to the EU’s valorisation of competitiveness in the Lisbon Process (particularly after the onset of recession in 2008).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social relationships are multifaceted and can act in many ways on physical and emotional well-being. We aim to study whether social networks and support are associated with functional limitations in Chilean older adults. Cross-sectional study with baseline of two cohort studies: the SABE cohort (born before 1940) and the Alexandros cohort (born between 1940 and 1948 from Primary Health Care centers), from Santiago. Were considered 1733 elderly. Performance variables were studied in 7 Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL): preparing food, managing money, leaving home alone, making purchases, making calls, doing light housework, organizing and taking medications, and 6 basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL): bathing, dressing, use of the bathroom, transfer, continence of urine and feeding. Having difficulties or inability to perform at least 1 activity was classified with having functional limitations (FL). Social network variables were: housing arrangement and marital status; social support variable was perception of material support, company or advice. Adjustment variables were: sex, age, education, income, depression, cognitive impairment, multimorbidity. Robust Poisson Regression was performed, prevalence ratios (PR) of FL were reported (α ≤ 0.5). Living accompanied (PR 0.96; 95% CI 0.88-1.03) and being married or live as a couple (PR 0.99; 95% CI 0.85-1.6) were not significantly related to functional limitation in IADL, similar in relation to living accompanied and performance in ADL (PR 0.96; 95% CI 0.88-1.03). Married or living couples have a lower prevalence of FL in ADL (PR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.92). Having material support, company or advice was associated with a higher prevalence of FL in ADL (PR 1.84; 95% CI 1.11-3.06) and in IADL (PR 2.48; 95% CI 1, 64-3.74). Being married or living as a couple in old age is a protective factor for functional limitation while having a positive perception of material support, company or advice showed to be a risk factor. Key messages Single, widowed or separated Chilean older adults are at greater risk of functional limitation, regardless of sociodemographic and health characteristics. The findings of this study should be confirmed with prospective design studies since the transversal design does not clarify the temporality of the relationship.",

      "title": "Mutual Cooperation In The Modern Era: Is It Still Relevant?",
      "abstract": "Background. Gotong royong is a cultural value rooted in the life of the Indonesian people. It reflects the spirit of togetherness, help-to-help, and cooperation in solving various social problems. However, as times develop and lifestyles become increasingly individualistic, these values face challenges in maintaining. Aim. This research aims to analyze the relevance of the culture of mutual cooperation in the modern era and how this culture is still applied despite social changes. Methods. The study used a qualitative approach with in-depth interview techniques with three respondents who lived in the KPAD area. The data obtained was analyzed to identify the form of mutual cooperation implementation and its supporting and inhibiting factors. Results. The study's results show that mutual cooperation is still carried out in various forms, such as community service, social activities, and the construction of public facilities. However, several obstacles, such as individual busyness, differences in values between generations, and the influence of technology, decrease active community participation. Conclusions. The culture of cooperation is still relevant in the modern era, but it requires adjustment to the current context of life to remain effective. Implications. Preservation efforts can be carried out through increasing public awareness through socialization, community coaching, and involving the younger generation in community activities to strengthen the spirit of togetherness. Avoid writing literature citations and abbreviations in the abstract. Don't forget to include the title of the research.",

      "title": "Social ageing and higher-order interactions: social selectiveness can enhance older individuals’ capacity to transmit knowledge",
      "abstract": "In long-lived organisms, experience can accumulate with age, such that older individuals may act as repositories of ecological and social knowledge. Such knowledge is often beneficial and can spread via social transmission, leading to the expectation that ageing individuals will remain socially well-integrated. However, social ageing involves multiple processes that modulate the relationship between age and social connectivity in complex ways. We developed a generative model to explore how social ageing may drive changes in social network position and shape older individuals’ capacity to transmit knowledge to others. We further employ novel hypernetwork analyses that capture higher-order interactions (i.e. involving ≥ 3 participants) to reveal potential relationships between age and sociality that conventional dyadic networks may overlook. We find that older individuals in our simulations effectively facilitate transmission across a range of scenarios, especially when transmission resembles a complex contagion or when social selectivity (i.e. prioritization of key relationships) rapidly emerges with age. These patterns result from the formation of tight-knit sets of older associates that co-occur in multiple groups, thereby reinforcing one another’s capacity to transmit knowledge. Our findings suggest key avenues for future empirical work and illustrate the use of hypernetworks in advancing the study of social behaviour. This article is part of the discussion meeting issue ‘Understanding age and society using natural populations’.",

Moreover, the audiences addressed by such media are not open-ended, democratic masses but rather distinct publics constituted by the very forms of discourse chosen by the works: gender roles are consolidated around songs addressed either to men or women, political preferences swayed through the promotion of certain celebrities, ethnic identities unified or exacerbated via the use of different languages, and so on. However widely it spreads, distribution is never even nor unbiased; it is always colored by processes of disparity.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the authors share and discuss their experience of how the marketing subject team of lecturers at Brighton Business School brings social concerns at the heart of their teaching, both at undergraduate and postgraduate level, in an attempt to develop students’ social consciousness and train social and environmental leaders of the future with a big- picture vision of the systems they will have to work within. There is a need for marketers who can drive change at organisations by coming up with new product or service ideas supported by business models that also help to address societal needs (Doyle, 2008). Addressing grand societal challenges demands a new kind of innovation, changing existing social paradigms, innovations that must create new social networks and capacities that evolve into new social structures and systems (Benneworth & Cunha, 2015). This corresponds to a shift in society’s expectations of business, forcing marketing educators to retool curriculum content (Borin & Metcalf, 2010). All the more since marketing has often been perceived as part of the problem rather than the solution to societal problems such as pollution, overconsumption, the depletion of natural resources, unhealthy lifestyles, and human rights abuses (Rowntree & Koernig, 2014). If developing learners’ capacities for social innovation has become part of universities’ objectives, and if particular courses have been designed in business schools to develop students as agents of change (Nicholls et al., 2013; Hesselbarth & Schaltegger, 2014), the biggest part of core marketing modules taught in business schools throughout America and Europe still consist nowadays of strategic marketing, principles of marketing, marketing research, and marketing communications (Kuster & Vila, 2006). The field of nonprofit or social service marketing is more rarely included (Harrigan & Hulbert, 2011). How can marketing lecturers focus on the areas of “people” and “planet” that appear to be lacking in their subject as most commonly taught? This communication is divided into five sections. First, the authors briefly review what social consciousness consists of and why it is of importance to marketing learners. The authors then report, as marketing faculty members at Brighton Business School, their own experience of how they tried and developed marketing students’ social consciousness in their modules and courses. First author describes how she, as marketing lecturer, embedded social matters into traditional modules of strategic marketing and international marketing at Masters’ level. Second and third author explain, as MSc in marketing and BSc business with marketing course leaders, how ethics, CSR, sustainability, social marketing and other social matters were integrated within their courses, both at postgraduate and undergraduate level. The final section contains discussion and conclusions.",

      "abstract": "The job of the school leader is becoming very difficult. During a working day, he has to face a variety of challenges and to find solutions for many problems of all kinds. The concerns and interests of parents, teachers and district administration do not always coincide. (Johnson, 1976: 80). On the other hand, public schools do not select the pupils who will attend. (Ibid) The children community in school is growing diverse due to their family origins which have different and unique structures, and to demographic movements. A diverse community represents diverse demands. The school leader shall be the manager and the teacher, the planner and the implementer, the school advocate and its critique, so as to be committed and able to perform its responsibilities (Pierce & Stapleton, 2002), comply with the requirements of DAR and MAS and find the right balance between different stakeholders. There are many complex roles a leader shall take which means assuming many accountability, however, not always justified by the salary. But, our main concern is to save the public schools, and in order to be able to compile such a mission, we need a new kind of leadership, visionary, able to understand what will happen to school at 5 to 10 years following, to identify problems and to know how to respond the needs in change of the community (Pierce & Stapleton, 2002).

      "title": "On the Problem of Structural Analysis in History",
      "abstract": "The very rapid growth of factual knowledge that characterizes contemporary scholarship has confronted research with the task of synthesizing this knowledge and of employing it to develop integrated ideas about the subjects studied. This task is not confined to the field of natural science, but confronts historical scholarship, too, in all its complexity. Thus, in recent years, the question of the possibilities for and methods of applying systems and structural analysis to the social sciences, particularly history, has been attracting increasing attention, because that analysis presumes an integrated approach to the subjects studied. It is a reality that the vast mass of facts gathered and analyzed in specialized, narrow studies, and from which general conclusions have been drawn on the empirical level, in their aspect as isolated problems and periods in the history of individual countries, demands further generalization, going beyond these narrow confines. But this requires the development of principles of typology for particular social entities — whose absence is constantly felt in arguments over which social system a given society belongs to (this holds particularly for precapitalist societies, both contemporary and in antiquity) — their place in world history, the paths being followed in their development, the features of transition to other modes of production or, what amounts to the same thing, the general and special regularities operative in them. All these questions have become particularly urgent recently in connection with the discussions on the paths to be followed in the further development of countries and peoples liberated from colonial dependence. The complex of problems we have listed is directly associated with the complexity of historical explanation and interpretation of facts, and the identification of laws and regularities operative over the entire course of human history, but modified at particular stages or to be seen only under given circumstances.",

      "title": "Community Futures: Web Tools to Empower Public Participation in Urban Development",
      "abstract": "The benefits of broad-based community involvement in urban design and planning are widely documented. This approach helps to increase community member satisfaction, enhance the sense of commitment in citizens, create realistic expectations of development outcomes, and build trust (Altschuler, 1970; McClure et al. 1997). However, these benefits do not come easily. Channels for community participation are written into many city laws, but this process can be complex enough to discourage even the most committed community advocates. The analog methods employed in current neighborhood planning processes to gather community feedback result in singular, static, and irregular interactions with the public. Rather than focusing on citizens’ evolving needs, these two-dimensional snapshots often cause public discussion to flatten into polarizing “pro” and “anti” positions, and many community members who could provide valuable insight simply stay silent. These antiquated techniques ineffectively utilize digital technology as a means for broader community involvement and collaboration. Technical expertise alone is inadequate for solving community design problems and the involvement of private citizens helps to ensure that effective and relevant strategies are created. A truly participatory planning process requires a mutual respect for the skills and knowledge citizens provide - community history, local knowledge, cultural values and understanding. As this conference theme suggests, systems that make visible transitions across time, place and information spaces are incredibly valuable. How might we advance the use of online tools as a means to connect with people over time and space to produce new, deep and continuing insights to inform the design process?",

Teilhabe muss daher bei Geflüchteten stärker als bei anderen Gruppen der Bevölkerung aktiv hergestellt werden und bedarf - zumindest teilweise - der Unterstützung durch Andere. Inwiefern es Geflüchteten ermöglicht werden soll, an der Gesellschaft teilzuhaben, ist in Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren politisch stark umkämpft. Der Artikel identifiziert Handlungslogiken in Bezug auf Teilhabe und veranschaulicht diese an drei verschiedenen Beispielen, wobei jeweils ein spezifischer Akteur als Träger in den Vordergrund gestellt wird: Die pragmatisch-präfigurative und im positiven Sinne naive Praxis der Bewegung der Flüchtlingssolidarität, die realistisch-integrationistische Perspektive der Arbeits- und Sozialverwaltungen sowie eine repressive, isolierend-exkludierende Praxis der Innenministerien. Alltäglicher Unterstützungsarbeit von Geflüchteten kommt vor diesem Hintergrund die demokratische Funktion zu, Teilhabe auch gegen staatliche Ausgrenzungspolitik zu ermöglichen.",

      "title": "Aging and Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Quality of life is both a multidisciplinary and a multidimensional concept. It can refer to physical wellbeing, incorporating medical disease, health conditions, and perceived health, to psychological wellbeing, as indexed by self-esteem and happiness, or to social well-being, capturing how well one functions in their social roles, and connections with family and friends. It can also be conceptualized as a sweeping concept that combines some or all of these particular domains; sometimes referred to as over-all wellbeing. It can refer to either or both the macro (societal, objective) andmicro (individual, subjective) levels. To illustrate, Anderson (2004) defines five domains of well-being: physical well-being (health, fitness, mobility, etc.); material well-being (possessions, transport, security, privacy, etc.); social well-being (family, relatives, interpersonal relationships, etc.); emotional well-being (trust, self-esteem, satisfaction, etc.); and development and activity (political freedom, employment, education, economic freedom, etc.). Bowling (2004) distinguishes between eight models of quality of life: objective standard of living; health and longevity; satisfaction of human needs; life satisfaction and psychological well-being; social capital; ecological and neighborhood resources; health and functioning; cognitive competence and autonomy and self-efficacy; and values and interpretations and perceptions. Arun and Cevik (2011) draw on Allardt and colleagues’ (1993) model, an index comprising three domains – having (material and interpersonal needs), loving (social needs), and being (needs for personal growth) – where each domain has both objective and subjective indicators. Within each domain, there is similarly no agreement on the conceptualization of the construct. For example, examining only the subjective domain, multiple terms and meanings are used that include morale, self-esteem, fulfillment, happiness, subjective well-being, and overall well-being. Subjective well-being can be studied as either or both cognitive evaluations of one’s life and affectivity (ongoing emotional reactions to one’s life) (Chappell 2007). It is often defined in terms of valuations of one’s life, events in one’s life, their bodies and their minds, and the circumstance of their lives (Diener 2006). The World Health Organization (WHO) (1995) has defined quality of life in terms of perceptions of one’s position in life within the context of their culture and in relation to goals, expectations, standards, and concerns. Camfield and Skevington (2008) argue that the centrality of value judgments in definitions of",

      "title": "The Social Dynamics of Social Identity Transitions",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this symposium is to explore the social dynamics of social identity transitions. To this end, the symposium will include the presentation of four papers which illustrate how social mobility (Martin and Beetz), shifts in social expectations (Knowlton), and observer judgement (Levitt, Murphy, and Pratt) influence people’s work- related social identity transitions. Research on people’s efforts to revise, repair, reconstruct, reinforce, or navigate work-related identities, known as “identity work” (Brown, 2015), has typically focused on situations in which individuals move across static role/job boundaries, such as from one professional role into another (e.g. Pratt, Rockmann, and Kaufmann, 2006), or how individuals manage static occupations that, by their nature, induce intrapsychic tension regarding identity (e.g. Kreiner, Hollensbe, & Sheep, 2006). Social identity transitions can be highly socially dynamic, however, with people often engaging in identity work due to changes in other individuals, institutions, and/or broad social forces (Brown, 2015; Petriglieri, 2011; Petriglieri et al., 2019). In a world that is ever more socially connected, interdependent, and transparent, the potential for social actors or forces to spur individual-level identity work by affecting a social group’s boundaries or meaning is high. By featuring work that provides insight into the social dynamics of social identity transitions, this symposium draws attention to a topic that is key to understanding the inner experiences of much of the present and future workforce.

      "title": "Social milieuxs in pubs and restaurants: An observation",
      "abstract": "The concept of social milieux has had an extraordinary renaissance in the german-speaking social sciences in the last 25 years. The analysis of social structures often uses the notion of social milieux as an alternative to concept of social class, in order to group the population into societal macro-milieus. Exemplified by Gerhard Schulze's notion of experience-milieus this paradigm seems to inherit the problem of class analytic sociology with its macro sociological focus. In contrast we develop a concept of plural milieux-belonging, that takes the heterogeneity and fragmentation of social networks of actors into account. Our empirical study of visitors of pubs and restaurants shows that the social milieuxs we observed in this leisure context could not be associated with specific societal macro-milieus in a simple way. Rather they were constituted by complex configurations of different criteria (class, gender, age). Equally, the structures of companionship inside the different milieuxs turned out to be quite heterogeneous. Whereas, e. g. communication structures in a working-clas milieux including all age groups were strongly gender homogamous, they were markedly geneder-heterogamous in the middle-clas milieu. While the constitution of social milieus in our empirical study seems to be quite complex, their association with different types of pubs and restaurants is mainly explained by the price-level of the latter, a rather traditional vertical characteristic of social structure analysis. Our micro-approach therefore does not only allow the discovery of the complexity of social milieu formation, but furtheremore opens the possibility of rather simple empirical explanations.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reports the results of the first study of the trajectory of borrowed words in the speech community and the role of socio-demographic factors (age, gender, social class membership, level of education, individual bilingual proficiency, minority versus majority status, neighborhood of residence) in their adoption and spread. Making use of a <italic>sharedness</italic> index, we infer channels of diffusion of specific words and borrowing types (nonce versus widespread) across cohorts. Among the novel findings are that borrowing behavior is not simply a function of lexical need, but is <italic>acquired</italic>, and that both borrowing rates and type are dictated by wider community norms rather than individual bilingual abilities. This is evidenced in (implicit) community-level sanctions against the elevated use of borrowing and community-wide preferences for a particular type of borrowing.",

Un mécanisme central répondant à cela peut être décrit par la notion d'habitus, prise comme unité de perceptions et d'actions collectivement formées et individuellement acquises, difficilement modifiables par des stimuli cognitifs. C'est le cas, par exemple, pour les représentations de la maladie, dans lesquelles la perception des perturbations de santé, leur traitement interprétatif et les dispositifs d'action qui en résultent s'entremêlent jusqu'à devenir un schéma unique. Ainsi, la maladie de déficit immunitaire, le sida, montre une relation étroite entre caractéristiques sociodémographiques spécifiques, phobies de contagion et représentations de la maladie résultant d'une étiologie profane, comportements d'évitement et tendances à l'exclusion. Comme ailleurs, le problème réside dans le fait que ces représentations ne peuvent être que difficilement modifiées par des campagnes d'information publiques.",

Esa carencia de condiciones se articula con el exceso de demandas de acciones de asistencia -en detrimento de las pedagogicas- haciendo a la intensificacion del sufrimiento docente. En esos escenarios el trabajo docente cobra caracteristicas singulares: frente a los obstaculos que se les presentan, aumenta la dificultad para crear acciones de modalidad alternativa. En esta investigacion (1), se pudieron relevar modalidades subjetivas de Impotencia -ligadas a la alienacion- y de Resistencia -frente a las violencias de que son objeto, las/os docentes utilizan mecanismos adaptativos que les permiten continuar con su tarea. Pero si bien los contextos de vulnerabilidad social actuan creando condiciones de produccion de subjetividad, no la determinan. En ese sentido, mientras las anteriores modalidades subjetivas se relacionan con modos “fallidos” de desempeno docente -es decir, en lugar de buscar medios para resolver la crisis, la sostienen- un tercer tipo de modalidad subjetiva se caracteriza por la posibilidad de instituir cambios y/o crear modos de accion alternativos en forma colectiva.

This lack of conditions is articulated by the excess of demands for actions of assistance - in detriment of pedagogic - that intensificates teacher’s suffering. In these scenes the educational work takes singular characteristics: new obstacles increase the difficulty to create alternative modality actions. In this research (1) could be relieved subjective modalities of Impotence -tied to alienation- and of Resistance -against to the violence that teachers are object, they use adaptive mechanisms to continue with his task. But though the contexts of social vulnerability create conditions of subjectivity production, they do not determine it. In this sense, while the previous subjective modalities are related to “unsuccessful” manners of teaching performance -instead of looking for means to solve the crisis, they hold it - the third type of subjective modality is characterized by the possibility of instituting changes and creating alternative manners of action in collective form.

      "abstract": "In the article, the main factors and barriers of social adaptation of reluctant migrants that are able to contribute to or to hinder successful adaptation to new social conditions of life are presented. Modern sociological concepts of adaptation and integration of migrants are analyzed such as the concept of acculturation by D. Berry; Interactive Acculturation Model by R. Bourhis, L. Moise, S. Perreault and S. Senecal; the concept of four dimensions of social integration of an individual/group (acculturation, placement, interaction and identification) by H. Esser; the concept of segmented integration by W. Bosswick and F. Heckmann.The following factors of successful integration of reluctant migrants are considered: relevance of sociocultural systems of the homeland and host societies; length of stay in a host society; civil/political participation; involvement in religious practices of a host society; dispersion of migrants residence; positive attitude to migrants from a new reference group; urbanized context of adaptation.The following barriers may impede the social adaptation of reluctant migrants: the existence of a “cultural conflict” between the homeland and host societies; lack of own housing; lack of jobs and stable income; spatial segregation or compact residence of migrants; hostile attitude of a host society; negative discourse of mass media; involuntary migration.It has been concluded that the knowledge and consideration of these factors and barriers can contribute to improvement of relations between local and migrant communities as well as the optimization of migrant adaptation practices.",

      "title": "Ecological Units: Definitions and Application",
      "abstract": "Concepts of ecological units, such as population, community, and ecosystem, are at the basis of ecological theory and research and have increasingly become the focus of conservation strategies. Concepts of these units still suffer from inconsistencies and confusions over terminology. The different concepts are treated here together as a common \"conceptual cluster,\" with similar ecological functions (roles) and similar problems in their definition and use. An analysis of the multitude of existing terms and concepts that have been developed for these units reveals that they differ with respect to at least four basic criteria: (i) the questions as to whether they are defined statistically or via a network of interactions; (ii) if their boundaries are drawn by topographical or process‐related criteria; (iii) how high the required internal relationships are; and (iv) if they are perceived as \"real\" entities or abstractions by an observer. The various definitions cannot be easily sorted into just a few types, but they can be characterized by several independent criteria. I argue that serious problems arise if the different possibilities of defining ecological units are not recognized and if the concepts are perceived as self‐evident. The different concepts of ecological units should be defined and used in a philosophically informed manner. I propose a dual approach to the use of ecological units. Generic meanings of the main concepts (especially population, community, and ecosystem) should be retained only as heuristically useful perspectives, while specific and \"operational\" definitions of the concepts as units should be developed, depending on specific purposes of their use. Some thoughts on the basic requirements for such definitions and the domains of their uses are briefly explained.",

      "abstract": "Solidarity and social inclusion, which are often used as synonyms in professional discourse on social work, are understood to date with too little focus on the structural level in politics, economics and social services. Furthermore, in the implementation of projects to promote social cohesion, marginalized groups such as people affected by poverty have so far been insufficiently involved in identifying commonalities between groups of people and in joint activities. Therefore, following the user involvement approach and on a structural level, I argue that political, economic and social conditions as well commitment must be in place. In the case of people affected by poverty, who are a very heterogeneous group, at least in Switzerland, mechanisms are needed to enable these groups to identify and voice their concerns and bring them to the attention of the appropriate political, economic or social decision-makers in a targeted manner. Using two research-based projects from poverty policy in Switzerland, I follow to answer the research question: How can people affected by poverty be given a voice in the structures and decision-making processes of poverty policy? The theoretical framework is based on the user involvement approach. Using participative, qualitative and quantitative research methods I answer the question with the potential impact, challenges and conditions of an implementable platform and training courses for professionals from politics, economics and social services, as well as for people affected by poverty. This differentiated knowledge of people affected by poverty and the fulfillment of the requirements of all those involved, a structure of exchange supported by social policy and led by external professionals, willingness to learn and work together, clear communication, or reimbursement of travel expenses, are necessary to strive for a truly sustainable and inclusive society, rather than one that merely appears to be so. However, it should be noted that potential impact has been identified and that further long-term impact and international comparative analyses are necessary to gain comprehensive knowledge.",

      "abstract": "When adopting cultural elements, for example when choosing which product categories to develop, or corporate values to adopt, organizations make choices that position them in markets vis-à-vis competitors, evaluating audiences, and other stakeholders. These choices are driven by multiple factors, and in turn drive the survival or demise of the said cultural elements. However, while the understanding of how cultural elements get adopted by actors, and evaluated by audiences, is now well-developed, it is not clear what features of cultural elements help them thrive, or hinder their development. Features can be idiosyncratic (inherent to the cultural element under consideration) or related to the environment and relations developed by the focal cultural element to other cultural elements. Using a social network perspective, we show that being embedded in many other cultural elements, in addition to being affiliated to high status actors in previous periods (but not in the current one), and being broadly covered by audiences, fosters replication and, ultimately, over time, resilience of cultural elements.",

However, these findings also raise questions of what role, if any, a broader sociocultural context of the talk may play in organising social behaviour, and whether different kinds of orderliness, or even a different turntaking machinery, may be managed and attended to according to different social or cultural conventions. In this paper, we provide examples from a range of Australian face-to-face conversations that show that, even in talk involving extended overlap or extended gaps, the same foundational principles of order in turn-taking apply. From this evidence, we suggest that variations in length and proliferation of gaps and overlaps are not symptomatic of different turn-taking machinery, but rather are contingent on contextual and situational factors.",

New treatment regimes have to be matched with new social organisation. Caring and coping present society‐wide challenges and to the need to reinvent key social institutions in order to respond effectively. Existing studies demonstrate the vulnerability of modern, large‐scale state institutions to loss of knowledge, skill and competence in the face of high attrition rates in their pay role staff. Equally, family and kinship as well as other civil society institutions or ‘traditional’ social structures may be so disrupted by the loss of carers and providers that they cease to generate adequate levels of well‐being and security. The role of key individuals in providing public leadership is recognised but the significance of personal networks in communicating effective messages and mores is more difficult to pin down. Associations and mass movements have emerged that play a vital role in changing social attitudes and behaviour, and social institutions are adapting to the challenge. It appears that diverse social responses are essential, but, I argue, public policy thinking has a ‘centralist’, hierarchical, bias that discourages' sensible thinking about plural, diverse, strategies. This article seeks to develop a way of thinking about strategy, around the idea of institutional competence, to take account of, and be responsive to, diverse social forms and initiatives.

      "title": "National Diversity and Conflict: The Role of Social Attitudes and Beliefs",
      "abstract": "To figure out how to minimize the costs and maximize the benefits, we need to understand all dimensions and types of diversity. Research shows that some diversity characteristics have a larger impact than others (Tsui, Egan, & O’Reilly, 1992). One type of diversity that could have a significant impact on workgroup interaction is national diversity. Every member, however, enters the workgroup with a set of personal and social attitudes and beliefs. These pre-programmed attitudes and beliefs may largely affect one’s perceptions and thus behaviors. Whether diversity will have positive or negative consequences may be explained by investigating attitudes of the group members. For this reason, I investigate nationalistic attitudes as exacerbators of conflict in nationally diverse workgroups. A set of studies investigates propositions that members with diverse national backgrounds, especially if they have strong nationalistic attitudes, are likely to experience more conflict than nationally homogenous groups (and/or if members do not hold strong nationalistic views). Other moderators of conflict and outcomes in nationally diverse workgroups that I examine using multiple methods (field, scenario, and lab studies) include social distances, national stereotypes, similarity preferences, and perceived respect.",

      "abstract": "The expanding principle of bilaterality: the cooperation between public institutions and faith communities (toward an efficient guarantee of protection of religious interests) ABSTRACT: More or less recent events (and conjunctures) recorded in the field of the regulation of State/Church relations would seem to endorse discouraging and discouraging readings: being able to speak, depending on the case, of a bilaterality now \"suspended,\" now \"apparent,\" and sometimes even \"betrayed.\" On the other hand, at the same time, contextual objective elements (and clues) induce one not to give in to discouragement, especially if the focus expands to the frequent examples of \"other\" bilaterality, different from the constitutionally regulated one (the concerted/administrative one; the dialogic-informal one), registering certain commendable \"incremental\" dynamics, especially in the crucial sign of the distancing from the worst of the vices that can weaken bilaterality, namely the standardization of its contents. The contribution offers a composite examination of the lights and shadows found in the matter, in light of the warning issued in the past by two distinguished scholars: it is difficult but necessary for the concrete making of legal experience to chase the heights of \"supra-legal\" (or \"rational\") law.

      "abstract": "The low income, pre-industrial nations face poverty as their dominant social reality. No nation, rich or poor, escapes the realities which call for attention to the issues of social transformation. The paradigm which guides the creation and utilization of scientific knowledge places great value on order, precision, and external manipulation and control. The capacity to manage social learning is itself a form of social knowledge which is created through social problem solving and which is not easily transmitted through textbooks or conventional training. While closely related to the topic of mutual self-help approaches to social services, the community level management of natural resources involves complex issues relating to asset control, benefits allocation, adaptation of technology to microenvironments, and preservation of productive potentials. From a management perspective the central challenge of social transformation is how to build into large bureaucratic organizations a capacity for innovative learning leading to a fundamental reorientation in their purposes and modes of operation.",

      "title": "Gender Inequality in the Economy of the EU Countries: A Modern Aspect",
      "abstract": "The aim of the article is to determine the current state of gender equality in the economy of the EU countries and to generalize proposals for overcoming the existing gender inequality. The understanding of gender inequality has always depended on the level of social development, and until now there is no unified approach to the interpretation of the essence of the concept of «gender inequality» in the scientific community. The main factors of gender inequality in the economy of the EU countries are religion, stereotypes and gender attitudes, which are interrelated and to some extent influence gender inequality in society. Religion can be attributed to the factors that directly led to the emergence of gender inequality. The existing groups of stereotypes play a significant role in the existence of gender inequality: the first group of stereotypes divides men and women on the basis of masculinity (dominance, activity, leadership ability) and femininity (dependence, emotionality); the second group of stereotypes includes ideas about the distribution of family and professional roles between men (active participation in public life, responsibility for the material support of the family) and women (responsibility for family relationships); the third group of gender stereotypes concerns the peculiarities of the nature of work (women’s work should be of a performing and service direction, and men should focus on creative and managerial activities). The European Union treats gender inequality as a significant problem that remains an obstacle to further economic development. Thus, throughout the existence of the EU, the employment rate of women there has been much lower compared to men (the economic activity of women is about 64%, while the employment rate of the male population is almost 73.8%). Another indicator that characterizes gender inequality is the differentiation in wages for the same or similar work. Gender gaps (the difference in the average pay of men and women, calculated as a percentage) vary significantly in different EU countries: Estonia has the highest level of gender pay gap (25.2%), Romania has the lowest (5%). In order to analyze the state of gender equality, the gender inequality index is usually used: the lowest values of the index are observed in Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland, which indicates a high level of gender equality achieved in these countries. On the other hand, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia are characterized by the highest value of the gender inequality index, that is, they have problems with gender equality. Thus, gender inequality is present in all areas of society in the European Union. In order to overcome it, the «Gender Equality Strategies of the European Union» are being developed and implemented, which ensure the promotion of gender equality and detail the directions of action.",

      "title": "Language Rights, Democracy and the European Union",
      "abstract": "Much of the current debate on language rights has focused on strategies for groups where there are speakers who are not able to use their own language in education, in contact with their state's bureaucracy or within their legal system, and are thus disadvantaged (de Varennes 1996). Other work has campaigned to aid the survival of languages where speakers are few in number and diminishing, and it seems likely that the language will disappear when the older generation that speaks the language dies (Skutnabb-Kangas 2000). These language rights issues are, of course, linked to two macro-political phenomena that have afected individuals in many ways beyond the purely linguistic and which have been hard to counter in any sphere. The first issue derives from the growth of the nation state, the penetration of state institutions into every aspect of citizens' lives and the state authorities' preference, if not requirement, for the ensuing contact to be in the state language. The second issue derives from the intensity of the interconnectedness, the velocity of flows, the networks and systems of interaction and exchange (Held et al. 1999: 27) of the modern world. Few groups are so isolated that their members do not know of events and attitudes outside. Their community desire to participate in these networks and flows is likely to be to the detriment of group specificity and in particular to the survival of languages that do not have the written forms needed for education and which are not currency in the exchanges.",

Para esto, se uso la observacion participante multisituada, entrevistas y conversaciones informales surgidas tras el encuentro entre antagonistas del conflicto armado en espacios denominados mesas de deliberacion en diferentes municipios de Colombia. Los resultados muestran que la reconciliacion es favorable a nivel local y en espacios donde existe aproximacion social porque esto facilita la (re)construccion de relaciones sociales fracturadas a causa del conflicto armado. Sin embargo, para las personas la reconciliacion no depende exclusivamente de las relaciones vecinales, tambien esta mediada por la relacion que tienen con el Estado; la garantia de sus derechos y por la efectiva construccion de paz en las zonas olvidadas y mayormente afectadas por el conflicto.",

      "title": "(Re)Imagining School as Community: Lessons Learned from Teachers.",
      "abstract": "IntroductionCommunity is a complex phenomenon. On the one hand, the notion of evokes feelings of trust, safety, love, and fellowship. In other contexts, a may be depicted as irreparable and pathological when its members are wrought by racism, violence, and continuous cycles of poverty (Limperopulos, 2014). As an ideological concept, the term is fundamental to fields such as sociology and ecology. Interestingly, as we explore the meaning of community, what is clear not only in relation to education, but in sociology and ecology, is that the word community has no distinct definition (Bender, 1978).Community varies by context and purpose. In regards to schools, much of the ambiguity surrounding the word comes from the fact that the term is often used in two distinct ways: in the first, the itself is a community; in the second, the school's engagement with its surrounding neighborhood is deemed the practice of community. With respect to the first definition of community, there is a need to distinguish between as measured by climate relationships and as measured by professional practices (Merz & Furman, 1997). The following quote by Bauer and Brazer (2012) illustrates this frustration: We cringe when someone tells us that their 'does professional learning community'-a professional learning is something your becomes, not something you or a few people on a team do (p. 280).With respect to the second definition of community, external relationships, it is unfortunate and factual that through structural and programmatic designs many public schools have severed ties with outside members (Merz & Furman, 1997). In addition, today's reform efforts, which include closure and the expansion of citywide, magnet, and charter schools serve to further broaden the gap between public schools and surrounding neighborhoods (Orfield, 2013; Ravitch, 2013).Dewey (1938) repeatedly argued that schooling must be the practice of for it is within schools where one learns how to participate in the larger society. Sergiovanni (1996) observed that if schools were to function as communities, then leaders must also serve as moral agents and should adapt their practices and theories to meet the needs of their respective sites. Hence, his argument was to replace school as an organization with school as community.Interestingly, while the literature has validated the merits of as generically, there continues to be a need for more studies that (a) explain the dynamics of as in terms of teacher-principal perspectives and actions, and (b) highlight how unique contexts (in this case an urban high school) determine one of the many meanings of schools as community. This study is an effort to fill this void.In order to explain the dynamics of as we employed a sequential mixed methods approach, grounded in teacher perspectives (of principal behaviors) to identify best practices for urban high principals who seek to transform their into a as community. The central research question we asked was: How does an urban high principal transform a into a as community?The next section, the literature review, explored schools as communities historically as well as in the context of post-Brown v. Board of Education (1954) reform efforts. Unlike previous reviews of literature on schools as communities which adhere to the internal-external dichotomy, we offer a holistic and contextual view on this topic.Literature ReviewPublic SchoolsWhen first conceived, public schools were deemed change agents and charged with raising the collective aspirations of the masses to foster social, economic, and political shifts (Gilbert, 1904). Paradoxically, for many people of color, public schools became tools for subjugation and marginalization (Greer, 1972). …",

      "title": "Ресоциализация освобожденных от наказания: история и современность",
      "abstract": "The term broadely used in the science and practice of prisoner treatment in recent years is in fact a derivative from the concept socialization. The latter means the process of human exploration of positive roles and relations, learning of a certain system of knowledge, skills and values. In this sense, resocialization is a kind of return to socialization, that is overcoming the defective relationship, restoration, creation and development of positive relations by individuals which make them a full-fledged member of society. These individuals can be convicts or people released and resocialization becomes a purposeful activity in their case.. Neither Russia, nor other countries have an integrative concept of resocialization. Penitentiary science and practice in relation to prisoners and the released often use other notions different from re-socialization: correction, social rehabilitation, social integration, etc. However, their uncritical application is confusing not only in theory but also in legislation, which eventually results in unreal and unachievable tasks set before penal policy makers. Meanwhile, there is no reason for mixing these concepts. As mentioned above (which, in general, has long been known), resocialization literally means restoring positive relations of the convicted. Correction is meant to do the same, but it is similar to resocialization only when the person lives in the community s/he is to socialize. Clearly, this is possible only if the penalties are not associated with isolation from society. In detention facilities correction merely implies the creation of subjective (motivational sphere) and objective (formation of external personality traits) prerequisites of resocialization. The contradiction between the ideal and the ideal citizen has long been common place in the penitentiary science. It is incorrect to treat convicts' in prison as labour adaptation: one cannot learn to swim out of water. Finally, the concept social seems totally unacceptable in this context. The essence of the former is the restoration of an unfairly disadvantaged legal and status, good name, reputation. In this sense rehabilitation is correctly referred to in Article 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, as well as in other legislative acts. What sort of restoring the good name one can speak about in relation to a convicted criminal?",

As a result, every facet of society has changed because of technological developments, including the delivery of social services. Although there is much debate over whether or not these changes are good or bad, they cannot be denied (Murphy and Pardeck, forthcoming). In fact, Jacques Ellul ( 1964: 127) has referred to modern society as a technological civilization. What he means by this designation is not only that society is dependent upon technology for its survival, but, more importantly, technological rationality has come to determine how persons view themselves and their environment. Due to the ubiquitous nature of this style of thinking, definitions of reality, sickness, and social competence have assumed a technological hue. Accordingly, those who are involved with the delivery of social services must understand how technology focuses their attention on techniques, thereby possibly obscuring the social nature of a client's problem. And if his type of insight is not fostered, no-one may benefit from the introduction of technology Into social service programs.",

      "abstract": "Fake social mobility is a phenomenon where individuals carry out fake social movements/social mobility. This is assessed from several indicators, including the existence of pretense in changing their lifestyle, coercion due to a hedonic lifestyle, and economic conditions that are the opposite of lifestyle. But it should be highlighted, this social change occurred without an increase in income, so that the change in style occurred due to the social environment, for example, actors borrow, beg, force or even steal to support their lifestyle. The method used in this study is the mox method, which combines quantitative and qualitative research methods. The results of the study show that fake social mobility is considered to have the potential to lead to criminal acts, or even depending on the level of influence, fake social mobility itself can be considered a criminal act. However, not all fake social mobility actions are negative phenomena considering one thing or another based on reasons that can be rationalized. As the name implies, fake social mobility cannot be said to be a part of social mobility because it is fake or does not match the real situation.",

Five experiments demonstrate that cues signaling a person’s separateness from others (as opposed to social connectedness) boost evaluations of their creative potential. “Lone” targets—engaging in activities alone—were judged more likely to generate creative ideas compared with targets engaging in identical activities with others. This effect was explained by perceived social independence and was unique to creativity judgments—our manipulation did not influence perceptions of other positive attributes, including ability to generate practical ideas (Studies 1a and 1b). The effect of social independence on perceived creativity was not reducible to perceived nonnormativity and was attenuated when creativity was construed as requiring convergent thinking rather than divergent thinking (Studies 2–4). Findings advance our understanding of how individuals of varying degrees of social connectedness tend to be viewed by others, providing insight into observers’ lay beliefs about creative potential.",

      "abstract": "The term ‘community’ is both controversial and difficult to define, but I can offer a working definition of it, as the social networks that exist within a given locality. These networks function at an accessible level of geography. In talking about ‘community’ we are inevitably discussing something which is ‘sub-class’; that is, a smaller entity than class itself. The basic point is that ‘community’ is a multifarious and complex phenomenon. Does the term refer to a geographical space, or some vague sense of belonging? Or, does it encompass not only locality and social networks, but also the meanings that people construct for themselves of the place and social relationships they are a part of?1 The notion of community, as it is commonly used, implies social integration, solidarity and mutuality. As Raymond Williams said some years ago, community, unlike all other terms of social organisation, never seems to be used unfavourably.2",

      "title": "Conclusion: the relevance of practice theory for researching social change",
      "abstract": "Conceptual elaboration of practice theories and their positioning in the academic field are important because this makes them more visible and prominent in academic research as well as in education.1 The distinctiveness and attractiveness of practice theory has been linked to its ability to offer a third-way perspective on society, moving beyond individualist/subjectivist and structuralist/objectivist understandings of the social. Not individual agents or social structures, but social practices are put forward as the adequate starting point for organizing both theorizing and carrying out empirical research. However, practice theories are frequently seen as being relevant for the study of small social phenomena only, such as daily routinized activities and face-toface interactions. Studies on situated practices (Stones, 2005) praxeologize the realm of the social by diving into, taking a close look, developing a view from within and providing thick descriptions of social practices that most of us are familiar with. It is true that numerous practice-based studies of mundane activities at the micro level have been carried out the last decade, such as washing practices, Nordic walking practices, medical practices, canteen practices, energy practices, sports practices and day trading practices (e.g. Schmidt, 2012; Shove et al., 2012; Kuijer, 2014; Nicolini, 2012; Spaargaren et al., 2013; Naus et al., 2014). However, social life also consists of large social phenomena, such as industries, markets, civil aviation, educational systems, sports leagues and international organizations. Until recently, the characteristics and transformations in these large social phenomena were the domain of other social and economic theories, like neo-institutionalism (Powell and DiMaggio, 1983) and transition theory (Grin et al., 2010; Geels et al., 2015), while hardly any practice-based studies existed of such phenomena. This situation is now changing as practice theorists and practice-based researchers are starting to think big. Nicolini (2012) and Schatzki (forthcoming) have been theorizing how to analyse large scale social phenomena from a practice perspective, while others have engaged in empirical research of complex chains of social practices (Lamers and Pashkevich, 2015), transitions in global food practices (Spaargaren et al., 2012) and the governance of sustainabledevelopment practices (Shove et al., 2012; Shove and Spurling, 2013). While this book shows how practice-based research can be put to use to study a wide variety of small scale social phenomena, it also contributes to the ambition of practice theories to investigate larger scale social phenomena. The objectives of this book were two-fold: first, to demonstrate how practice theories can be used for empirical analyses that aim to understand social reproduction and social change; and second, to outline the conceptual and methodological challenges connected with the use of practice theories when applied to both small and large social phenomena. To meet these objectives the contributions to this book were organized in three main ways. First, by combining research on small and large phenomena into one book, we aimed to show that research on social practices can and must engage with practice-arrangement bundles of different sizes. Practicearrangement bundles refer to interconnected social practices and material arrangements (Schatzki, forthcoming). They can be more or less stretched out in time and space, and their extensiveness can be investigated with the lens alternating from the proximity modus to ever more distant views, and back. Second, since the focus of the book is on conceptualizing and researching the dynamics in contemporary societies, the contributions cover a diverse set of empirical phenomena. The reader is introduced in social phenomena as diverse as street violence, playing tennis, growing food, preventing waste, governing forests, suffering in medical care practices and managing conservation tourism partnerships. By exploring such diverse corners and segments of the plenum, practice theories are tested for their most generic and specific qualities at the same time. Generic in the sense that the book demonstrates that taking social practices as the privileged unit of analysis is instrumental for generating new knowledge about the social across a wide range of social phenomena. Specific in the sense that when practice theories are applied to, for example, the field of violence research, they are shown to be innovative on a number of aspects in that domain, which are however less relevant for the positioning of practice theories in, for example, sports or forest governance. Third, we also invited the authors of this volume to be sensitive about the policy or governance dimension of their research. Reflecting on the socio-political impact of research is important because new knowledge can be used in the ongoing reproduction of social practices by different actors in different ways. Furthermore, being more clear on the insights that practicebased research delivers for policy making and evaluation raises its overall relevance. This chapter will discuss how and to what extent we have reached the aims of this book. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. In the next section we will make up the balance of the book, highlighting the key contributions made by both the individual chapters and the book as a whole. The chapter will conclude with a future agenda for practice theory and practice-based research.",

However, the complex societies we have created seem to prohibit the adequate use of individual cognitive capacities to ensure our collective sustainability. This chapter proposes ways to collaboratively engage diverse people's rational and arational capacities (such as empathy and intuition) with big-picture knowledge and perspectives to generate a more comprehensive form of intelligence – co-intelligence or public wisdom. Seven principles, related to making public judgement wiser are explained, namely: long-term, systemic, inclusive, possibility oriented, empowering, universal, and meaningful. They allow public wisdom to be generated by engaging many people in well-designed, iteratively convened multi-modal conversations which can make reality more comprehensible to all involved with communities and countries learning from how their outcomes can impact the real world. If embedded in cultures and social systems, such activities can have significant impact on sustainability.",

Defining and delineating its boundaries is difficult and can be arbitrary. Overlaps exist between corporate and marketing communication and arguments are rife as to which subsumes the other. Some of the debate is semantic and superfluous. Other aspects are born out of the development of 'functional silos' (Schultz, 1993). What is not contested is the multifarious nature of corporate communication and in recent years a spotlight has turned towards a deeper understanding of the communica-tion process is rarely fully articulated or understood. Wolter (1993) has complained (at least in the past) that it suffers from superficiality, ambiguity and rigidity. Whilst ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of each aspect of corporate communication is clearly important, so too is the need to manage and evaluate the impact and efficacy of the myriad communication activities that come together (White, 1997) either to work in harmony or disrupt one another. This can be considered at a variety of 'levels' from the individual campaign to the holistic corporate communication effort (see Figure 14.1).",

      "title": "Problems in the study of ancient Maya settlement and social organization : insights from the Minor Centre of Zubin, Cayo District, Belize",
      "abstract": "For over a century archaeologists have attempted to formulate a realistic model\r\nfor ancient Maya social organisation. A review of the current literature indicates that,\r\nalthough significant progress has been made towards achieving this goal, fundamental\r\nmethodological and theoretical weaknesses remain. The most detrimental shortcomings\r\ncan be summarised as follows: (1) settlement pattern studies in the Maya area have\r\ntended to focus too much on the polar extremes of the settlement continuum, and thus\r\nhave not produced adequate data representative of all levels of the settlement hierarchy;\r\n(2) the limited nature of excavations, apart from those conducted in the larger centres,\r\nhas hindered our ability to compare material culture assemblages from the various\r\nsettlement levels; (3) these restricted excavations have also failed to furnish us with a\r\ncomprehensive diachronic perspective, something which is required for an understanding\r\nof social relationships; (4) Mayanists have often employed interpretative schemes and\r\nassociated terms in an uncritical fashion. As a result of these weaknesses, our\r\nreconstructions of ancient Maya social organisation often slight the archaeological data\r\nin favour of the more inclusive ethnohistonc or ethnographic descriptions. This\r\ndissertation will address the aforementioned problems through a detailed analysis of a\r\nsmall minor centre located in the upper Belize River valley. This site, known as\r\nZubin, was the focus of three seasons (1992-1995) of detailed archaeological\r\nexcavations conducted by the author. These investigations were designed to generate a\r\nmultifaceted and diachronically sensitive data base from a site representative of the least\r\nunderstood segment of the ancient Maya settlement continuum. It was felt that\r\nexplorations at this level would provide insights relevant to a more complete\r\nunderstanding of social organisation. In addition, with the new perspective provided by\r\nthe Zubin project, I evaluate the various models proposed for ancient Maya social\r\norganisation. In doing so I touch on the various weaknesses inherent in the study of this\r\ntopic, and outline a program of analysis that should facilitate the formulation of a more\r\nrealistic characterisation of ancient Maya society.",

We elicit beliefs about other subjects’ actions in the same modified dictator games to test how much of the existent heterogeneity in others’ actions is known by subjects. We find that subjects with different interdependent preferences in fact have different beliefs about others’ actions. In particular, Selfish individuals cannot conceive others being non-Selfish while Social Welfare maximizers are closest to the actual distribution of others’ actions. We finally provide subjects with information on other subjects’ actions and re-classify individuals according to their (new) actions in the same modified dictator games. We find that social information does not affect Selfish individuals, but that individuals with interdependent preferences are more likely to change their behavior and tend to behave more selfishly.",

We ran two ecological momentary assessment studies – with adult (N=110; 6 prompts/day for 7 days) and preregistered adolescent sample (N=69; 6 prompts/day for 10 days). General negative experiences (negative emotions, worsened mood) predicted higher odds of preferring solitude, and so did social experiences (loneliness, high social load). Preference for solitude under distress emerged despite whether the person was with others or alone, so it is not just about wanting to get out of unpleasant social encounters. In adolescents, while such desire for solitude is generally avoidance-driven, those prone to social stress also preferred this time for regulatory aims – rest, autonomy, and reflection. Overall, the patterns support an allostatic view: the everyday desire for time alone is to help manage demand, not merely to escape; it highlights moments when withdrawing, rather than seeking more socialization, may be preferable.",

      "title": "The Vulnerability Vortex",
      "abstract": "A societal crisis, by definition, taxes resources and puts individuals and communities at risk. Social structures can quickly come undone, as existing inequalities become more pronounced. Those already living on the margins (socially, culturally, psychologically, physically, economically) can readily be pushed beyond previous coping strategies into \"calamity coping\" where human capability and opportunity are severely limited. In this chapter, we use the term vulnerable to describe those who are placed at the intersections of exposure to risk (due to societal changes, epidemics, war, etc.) and an inability to cope. Crucially, we consider vulnerability to extend beyond certain common definitions that restrict it to existential threats and survival needs, and instead also include factors that prevent individuals and communities from being well and from thriving. Vulnerability is complex and multilayered, never static, but rather in flux, possessing a temporal component and which occurs on a spectrum. Various factors can augment or mitigate certain risk factors to nourish resilience or restore individual and community agency. Using examples from COVID-19 and its syndemic challenges (e.g., diabetes, obesity), nonmodifiable biological risk factors (e.g., ageing) and, modifiable environmental risk factors (e.g., ability or inability to socially distance), we introduce the concept of a Vulnerability Vortex. This concept both accounts for the complex drivers of vulnerability, and demonstrates how individual actors and systems can support vulnerable people and communities in more responsible and concrete ways.",

      "abstract": "Masyarakat adalah sistem hubungan dalam arti hubungan antar organisasi dan bukan hubungan antar sel. Kebudayaan mencakup segenap cara berfikir dan bertingkah laku, yang timbul karena interaksi yang bersifat komunikatif seperti menyampaikan buah pikiran secara simbolik dan bukan warisan karena keturunan (Davis, 1960). Apabila diambil definisi kebudayaan menurut Taylor dalam Soekanto (1990), kebudayaan merupakan kompleks yang mencakup pengetahuan, kepercayaan, kesenian, moral, hukum adat istiadat dan setiap kemampuan serta kebiasaan manusia sebagai warga masyarakat, maka perubahan kebudayaan dalah segala perubahan yang mencakup unsur-unsur tersebut. Soemardjan (1982), mengemukakan bahwa perubahan sosial dan perubahan kebudayaan mempunyai aspek yang sama yaitu keduanya bersangkut paut dengan suatu cara penerimaan cara-cara baru atau suatu perbaikan dalam cara suatu masyarakat memenuhi kebutuhannya. Untuk mempelajari perubahan pada masyarakat, perlu diketahui sebab-sebab yang melatari terjadinya perubahan itu. Apabila diteliti lebih mendalam sebab terjadinya suatu perubahan masyarakat, mungkin karena adanya sesuatu yang dianggap sudah tidak lagi memuaskan. Menurut Soekanto (1990), penyebab perubahan sosial dalam suatu masyarakat dibedakan menjadi dua macam yaitu faktor dari dalam dan luar. Faktor penyebab yang berasal dari dalam masyarakat sendiri antara lain bertambah atau berkurangnya jumlah penduduk, penemuan baru, pertentangan dalam masyarakat, terjadinya pemberontakan atau revolusi. Sedangkan faktor penyebab dari luar masyarakat adalah lingkungan fisik sekitar, peperangan, pengaruh kebudayaan masyarakat lain.",

      "title": "\"The Power of Words we RARELY Use: Dignity, Rights and Responsibility\"",
      "abstract": "Words matter, but some words are seldom used in management discourse— and that gap has important implications for what is and is not considered relevant for research, teaching, and management practice. In particular, we argue that organizational research should connect more directly with other social sciences to update and enlarge its theoretical repertoire to encompass core elements of humanism, particularly the concepts of human dignity, rights, and responsibilities. Specifically, we propose articulating that connection with the social sciences around three main terms (words): 1) The notion of human dignity which has played a central role in many social sciences, and is credited as a main driver of economic and civilizational progress (Kateb, 2011; McCloskey, 2010; Rosen, 2012). 2) The notion of human rights, which is a mainstay of many social sciences but rarely gets treatment within management other than in business ethics(Levy & Sznaider, 2010; McEldowney & Weick, 2003; Meyer & Parent, 1992; Wettstein, 2009, 2009 ), and 3) The notion of responsibility, which has gained more traction in the discourse on management, as the term CSR has gained increasing visibility (Carroll, 1999; Matten & Moon, 2008; Waddock, 2008; Waddock, Bodwell, & Graves, 2002). We suggest, however, that responsibility is critical for sustainable social well-being and without a connection to the prior two terms remains an anemic concept. After a short introduction on the power of the words we RARELY use, specifically, dignity, rights, and responsibilities, Claus Dierksmeier (University of Tuebingen) will outline the central notion of human dignity. Florian Wettstein (University of St. Gallen) will build on the notion of human dignity and will outline the genesis of human rights and their role within management research. Sandra Waddock (Boston College) will argue that well-being should be the central construct in management and economic thinking—with human dignity as the foundational value creating attendant rights and responsibilities for businesses, and by implication, management scholarship. After discussion, the panel will entertain questions and answers from the audience with the goal to inform business school researchers and teachers on how such words could be used more frequently and help management theory to increase accuracy and relevance.",

      "title": "Youth Between Integration and Disaffiliation in French Cities",
      "abstract": "Contrary to accepted ideas, young people are not always passive in the face of risk and unemployment, nor are they merely the sum of their previous familial, educational, and social trajectories. Rather, they are coauthors of their own socialization, endowed with a capacity for interpretation and an ability to invent social roles, even in situations of constraint and great risk. Of course, when situations become intolerable, individuals' capacity for action diminishes almost to the vanishing point. At the same time, however, the socialization of young people is still a continuous and dynamic process that moves forward through a series of alterations, readjustments, and identity conflicts among those young people and the groups to which they belong. According to Becker and McCall (1990), “Nothing is fully determined. At every step of every unfolding event, something else might happen. To be sure, the balance of constraints and opportunities available to the actors, individual and collective, in a situation will lead many, perhaps most of them to do the same thing” (p. 6).",

Le refus de week-end, shopping , living ou stop par les normateurs du Quebec est une bien faible reaction devant le deferlement d'anglicismes qui rend le discours des garagistes francophones de Montreal absolument incomprehensible au voyageur francais, et qui seme le discours le plus quotidien de crosser (« traverser »), ouatcher (« prendre garde a ») et de formes apparemment francaises, comme char (<car) recouvrant des semantismes empruntes (calques, comme breuvage < beverage). Mais les Quebecois preoccupes par ce probleme savent fort bien qu'une norme artificielle, unique, rigoureuse, ne saurait etre respectee par tous. Ayant a faire un certain nombre de choix pour definir une norme, ils ne peuvent la croire definitive et intangible. Les attitudes d'intervention linguistique, dans ce contexte, ne sauraient etre dites puristes, si l'on admet les elements de definition donnes plus haut. Le purisme, solution de paresse dans la mesure ou il lui faut tout ignorer de la connaissance scientifique de la langue pour mieux refuser la realite de l'usage, devrait ceder la place a un interventionnisme motive et explicite ou se resigner a n'etre qu'un discours ornemental et sans effet. L'absence de science linguistique, puis l'isolement un peu farouche des linguistes dans l'abstraction du systeme, l'ont permis, puis prolonge. On peut penser que le developpement d'une socio-linguistique rend aujourd'hui impossible cette forme archaique d'attitude normative. Mais les raisons profondes du jugement de valeur sur l'usage linguistique, et le desir de le modeler selon l'ideologie dominante restent les memes. Il ne s'agit pas de refuser toute norme aucune societe ne s'en passe mais bien d'en surveiller la construction par l'analyse scientifique, et de comprendre l'activite normative, c'est-a-dire de la modifier, comme un secteur de la pratique sociale moins innocent qu'il n'y parait.",

      "title": "Basic Human Needs: Concept or Slogan, Synthesis or Smokescreen ?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Basic Human Needs/Basic Needs emerged in the middle 1970s as a widely debated way of analysing and formulating development. It has a number of elements and has drawn upon a number of country experiences and is to many proponents an attempted synthesis rather than a slogan. BHN and BN are only partly compatible with each other because of their quite different emphases on participation and equality versus organisation and minimum standards, reflecting broadly divergent political economic goals and perceptions. BHN as a strategy goes further than the provision (production and distribution) of basic goods and services to include full and fairly remunerated employment and participation. RESUMEN Necesidades humanas básicas: Concepto o slogan, síntesis o constructo artificial? Los conceptos de necedidades humanas básicas/necesidades básicas (NHB/NB) aparecieron a mediados de los años 1970 como manera ampliamente debatida de analizar y formular el desarrollo. Comprenden varios elementos y se han enriquecido de las experiencías de numerosos países, constituyendo a los ojos de sus proponentes una especie de síntesis más bien que un slogan. NHB y NB son sólo en parte recíprocamente compatibles a causa del énfasis tan diferente que ponen en la participación y en la igualdad por oposición a la organización y a los niveles mínimos, reflejando fines y concepciones político‐económícas considerablemente divergentes. NHB en cuanto estrategía va más allá de la mera provisión (producción y distribución) de bienes y servicios básicos para comprender el empleo y la participación remunerados de manera plenamente equitable. RESUME Besoins fondamentaux de l'homme: concept ou slogan, synthèse ou écran de fumée? Besoins fondamentaux de l'homme/besoins fondamentaux, cette formule est apparue aux alentours de 1970 comme un moyen fort controversé d'analyser et de formuler le développement. Elle contient un certain nombre d'éléments et a fait appel aux expériences d'un certain nombre de pays: elle est pour beaucoup de ses défenseurs un essai de synthèse plutôt qu'un slogan. BFH et BF ne sont qu'en partie compatibles puisqu'ils mettent un accent tour à fait différent sur la participation et l'égalité face à l'organisation et les standards minima, reflétant des objectifs et des perceptions divergeant grandement politiquement. BFH en tant que stratégie va plus loin que la fourniture (production et distribution) de produits et services de base pour inclure le plein emploi bien rémunéré et la participation.",

      "title": "Community Engagement Post-Disaster: Case Studies of the 2006 Matata Debris Flow and 2010 Darfield Earthquake, New Zealand",
      "abstract": "Engagement is a construct that has different meanings in different contexts (Son & Lin, 2008). It is often used describe a range of actions that take place between people and organisations. It can include a variety of approaches and styles of participation, such as one-way communication or information delivery, consultation, involvement and collaboration in decision-making, and empowered action in informal groups or formal partnerships. These terms also take on different meanings depending on the context (Goodman et al., 1998; Pretty, 1998). Hudson and Bruckman (2004) make the distinction that engagement only requires active mental attention, while participation requires the listeners contribute and shape the discussion. In a preliminary findings report by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2), it was identified that the term engagement meant different things different people across a range of countries. They felt that to facilitate cross-cultural communication it may be useful provide functional descriptions of a process rather than assuming a shared understanding of terminology (Offenbacker, Springer, & Sprain, 2009, p. 5). The word 'community' is also a very broad term used define groups of people, whether they are stakeholders, interest groups, or citizen groups. A community may be a geographic location (community of place), a community of similar interest (community of practice), or a community of affiliation or identity (such as an industry or sporting club). The combined terms community and engagement describe a process of diversely defined groups working together. On the State of Victoria's Department of Sustainability and Environment Website, Introduction Engagement, the linking of the term 'community' 'engagement' serves broaden the scope, shifting the focus from the individual the collective, with the associated implications for inclusiveness ensure consideration is made of the diversity that exists within any community. Research has shown that utilising a community engagement approach prior a disaster as an effective way facilitate and implement resiliency-building activities with community members in a neighbourhood context (Norris et al., 2007). This involves a range of different types of participation including the involvement of members of the community in planning preparedness strategies for their community in response a disaster (Patterson, Weil, & Patel, 2009; Skanavis, Koumouris, & Petreniti, 2005). Using an engagement approach that builds on existing community knowledge and that creates a sense of ownership in the community can result in communities that are more resilient and prepared for disasters and are able recover more quickly from disasters (Jessamay & Turner, 2003; Norris & Stevens, 2007; Norris et al., 2007). This process can have the additional value of increasing the skills of members of the community and ensuring knowledge stays in the community, with community members themselves building capacity (Spee, 2008). Community engagement is identified as an important component in achieving improved psychosocial recovery for individuals and groups post-disaster (Attree et al., 2011). The use of a range of engagement approaches between agencies and communities ensures that information flows out the local public, and that communities are able provide feedback, are listened to, and are active participants in their recovery, providing them with a sense of purpose and control over their situation (Morrow, 1999). Effective community engagement also assists in creating a relationship of trust between agency representatives and members of affected locations (Goodman et al., 1998). Feeling included in decisionmaking, being listened to, and having information are key elements improving individual and community well-being (Paton, 2008). The benefits for agencies are actions that are potentially more effective, sustainable and appropriate (Paton, 2008). …",

      "abstract": "Health workers in many parts of the world have a problem to successfully translate the term public health into their own languages bearing in mind the precise meaning of the concept. As for Serbia, the issue appeared to be solved 130 years ago, when B. Franklin's well-known sentence Public health is public wealth had been initially translated. The phrase used (narodno zdravlje) was based on the already established German expression Volksgesundheit, but simultaneously in an optimal way reflected the idea of public health in Serbian. The adjective narodno has no exact equivalent in English, since it lacks socialistic connotation, as people's, informal one, as folk's, or too official one, as nation's. If any, the last option would still appear as the most adequate. In the recent past, the term public health services has been introduced, but enthusiasm for it fades away since this innovation demonstrates a lack of understanding of the whole broadness of the public health approach. Lawmakers in 2005 and 2009 replaced narodno with javno without consulting the academic community. This is an unfortunate move, because the only opposite of javno in Serbian is either tajno (secret) or privatno (private) and none of them fits well as a meaningful exclusion criterion. The author argues that the introduction of javno only serves a retrograde ideological prejudice and that tradition should be respected.",

But these power relationships which are bound into the practice of oral art are not independent of other power relationships based upon moral, economic or political criteria.",

      "abstract": "One of the primary functions of language is to 'scaffold human affiliation within cultures and social groups and institutions' (Gee, 1999, p. 1). In simple terms, to affiliate is 'to bring into association or close connection' (Yallop, et al. 2005, p. 22) and we could say that affiliation is a social process in which interactants (a writer and reader, for example) negotiate similarities, establish (dynamic) communities, and negotiate communal identities within and across texts. In other words, texts (casual conversations, research articles, novels, stand-up comedy performances, newspaper articles) play a role in creating a sense of 'closeness' (Don, 2011, p. 306). While shared experience is important in this process (Gee, 2000/2001, p. 105), communal identity also involves 'solidarity around values' that bond members together (Knight, 2010, p. 53). So, what does research around the concept of affiliation offer English teachers and their students?",

To be sure, not all ideas are culturally successful. Some ideas are never represented in minds. Some are represented, but never communicated to others. Yet other ideas are successfully communicated to enough people that they become fashionable for a short time, but quickly fade away. But a small number of ideas are culturally successful: They permanently invade a group of minds. According to an epidemiological approach to explaining culture, then, \"contagious\" ideas and their material effects, such as texts, tools, buildings, and artwork, constitute what we call culture. According to this view, an idea is \"cultural\" to the extent that it is widespread in a group (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman, 1981; Sperber, 1990, 1996; see also Campbell, 1974; Dawkins, 1982; Boyd & Richerson, 1985).",

Yet as human beings we are also aware of our own powers to determine future courses of action. As active agents in possession of what sociologists may refer to as a uniquely reflexive quality, we hold understandings of how we exist in relation to the social contexts in and through which we live, and how these forces exert an influence over our preferred ways of living and working (Archer 2005). It is from this reflexive character, this essential and universal condition of human existence, that the powers of structural and cultural forces are mediated by us as human subjects. When faced with social contexts that appear to stand in our way or which we are not readily inclined to follow, it is from our reflexivity that we go about the redefinition of our ongoing concerns, draw upon those resources over which we can exercise some command, formulate new ways of working, and resist or cooperate with whatever it is that seems to impede our sense of what is right and proper.",

People are similar to their neighbors in a social network for two distinct reasons: first, they grow to resemble their current friends due to social influence; and second, they tend to form new links to others who are already like them, a process often termed selection by sociologists. While both factors are present in everyday social processes, they are in tension: social influence can push systems toward uniformity of behavior, while selection can lead to fragmentation. As such, it is important to understand the relative effects of these forces, and this has been a challenge due to the difficulty of isolating and quantifying them in real settings.",

Teams organized like distributed processing [5] over-look the benefits from the interdependence of multitasking [11]). In our model, the entropy of interdependence reduces degrees of freedom like quantum entanglement, allowing maximum entropy production (MEP) to solve problems. Evolution in Nature (viz., ) demonstrates MEP [6] from intelligent choices [7]. Exploiting interdependence improves team intelligence [8]; forced cooperation dis-organizes it; e.g., China is reducing its social intelligence [9]. In our model, competition self-organizes those willing to sort through the noise for the choices that improve social welfare. Social systems organized around competition (checks and balances) better control a society than authoritarian regimes (e.g., on China's inability, see [12]). Authoritarians are inefficient in sizing teams to solve problems; e.g., Sinopec oil company uses about 548 thousand employees to produce about 4.4 million barrels of oil per day whereas Exxon uses about 82 thousand employees to produce about 5.3 million barrels of oil per day [10]. Overall, the density of MEP directed at solving problems in a society able to freely self-organize its labor and capital is denser.

This development is seen to have taken off in the 1990s (Norris, 2000) as part of the adaptation to the “imperatives of the professionalization” of political advocacy and publicity, which constitutes one of the most prominent dynamics of the politics-media relationship in the current “age” of political communication (Blumler and Kavanagh, 1999, p. 214). Other aspects of the professionalization trend notwithstanding, the accelerated pursuit of agenda-setting through the management of communication content (issue selection, priming, framing, simplification, personal focus, negative campaigning, etc.) and media relations (network-building, selective liaising with journalists, leaking, event creation, damage control, etc.) can be said to constitute the core of current communication strategies employed by political actors.",

      "title": "Critical Community Service Learning: Combining Critical Classroom Pedagogy with Activist Community Placements",
      "abstract": "In recent years, community service learning (CSL) has become a prominent pedagogy in higher education (Speck & Hoppe, 2004). CSL combines real world experiences and academic learning, encourages moral development, promotes citizenship, and facilitates a sense of social responsibility. It is not surprising, however, that what constitutes citizenship and social responsibility is the subject of debate. There is no agreement, for instance, that social justice is an intended outcome of CSL (Marullo & Edwards, 2000; Zlotkowski, as cited in Chambers, 2009). In fact, critics have suggested that CSL too often is comprised of community experiences maintaining a charitable or voluntary orientation, fails to explore and address the root causes of injustice (Kahne & Westheimer, 2006; Westheimer & Kahne, 2004), and ignores critical issues such as the presumption of neutrality, privileging of whiteness, and imbalance of power relations that support social inequalities (Butin, 2003, 2007). In this paper, we share a model of CSL that responds to these criticisms--critical CSL. We use the term critical CSL to invoke an association with the critical theories that have informed both a justice-oriented perspective and the development of critical pedagogy. Critical CSL can be understood as an approach that embraces the explicit aim of social justice. As Mitchell (2008) explained, the goal of critical CSL is to deconstruct systems of power so the need for service and the inequalities that create and sustain them are dismantled (p. 50). Thus, critical CSL is potentially effective when paired with a critical pedagogical approach. However, few authors have shared detailed accounts of how critical CSL might function and how critical pedagogy might work with critical CSL to support students' learning. The critical CSL that we explore in this paper was used in a graduate seminar taught by Donna Chovanec, one of the paper's authors. In 2009, with support from the University of Alberta Community Service-Learning Program and approval from the University Research Ethics Board, the instructor initiated a qualitative research study, asking the question: How might a critical/radical CSL pedagogy inform a critique of conventional service-learning in post-secondary contexts? The research team (1) reviewed CSL literature and collected the following data: three written homework assignments completed by students as part of the course; a short online survey adapted with permission from J. Westheimer; and individual, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 students who had completed the course six months to two years prior. In addition, the instructor and one student completed written anecdotes on specific aspects of the course experience. Phenomenological analysis of the data revealed that the course/critical CSL experience facilitated students' willingness to go deeper into social issues by analyzing root causes and enabled many students to develop an awareness of systemic inequality, power inequalities, the beliefs and practices that support domination, and their own positionality in the social system (Chovanec, Kajner, Mian, & Underwood, 2012). These research findings prompted the research team to interrogate the pedagogical dimensions of the course that combined critical classroom pedagogy with activist community placements. Focusing this paper on the course pedagogy, we draw from critical pedagogy theory, research study data, and instructor and student anecdotes to explore the pedagogical dimensions of our experience with critical CSL. Four dimensions are included: course/placement integration, critical pedagogy in practice, the intricacies of recruiting and supporting activist placements, and ethical considerations. While critical CSL requires careful design and consideration of the risks involved, we conclude that it can be an effective approach for critical educators. Course/Placement Integration Effective CSL engages the community as partners in student education and tightly integrates the academic part of the course and the community placement (Bowman, Brandenberger, Mick, & Toms Smedley, 2010; Bringle, Hatcher, & Games, 1997). …",

Using concepts from evolutionary biology, I investigate whether non-bizarre delusions might be a form of strategic deception. Non-bizarre delusions comprise a small number of themes, including grandiose, paranoid, and somatic. If, hypothetically, delusions were believed by friends and family members, delusional individuals would likely receive important benefits, such as increased social status and respect (in the case of grandiose delusions), increased protection (in the case of paranoid delusions), or increased care and assistance (in the case of somatic delusions). There is considerable evidence that severe social problems are an important cause of non-bizarre delusions. Moreover, in many cultures and sub-cultures, delusional individuals are believed by friends and family members and, hence, receive many benefits. The possibility therefore exists that delusions evolved to mitigate the dangerous consequences of social failure by serving to unconsciously deceive others into providing social benefits that otherwise would not be forthcoming.",

Only through trustworthy, strong, knowledgeable and skill-based relationships with clients and others can social workers help clients to reach their goals (Beresford, Croft & Adshead, 2007; Kerson & McCoyd, 2002). As a concept, relationship can be interpreted in diverse ways. It is an association or involvement, a connection by blood or marriage, or an emotional or other connection between people. Other synonyms for relationship include dependence, alliance, kinship, affinity, or consanguinity, but each of these words suggests a different meaning based on a distinctive bond and duration. People can be related who have never met and never will; for example, people who have a common membership in a religious or fellowship group or a common profession may feel or act more \"related\" than first cousins.",

Examining 3-person groups in simulated negotiations, it was found that the differences in group members’ motivational orientations affected both (a) how resources were distributed within the groups (individualistic members exploited cooperative members and got the lion’s share of the resources, even when the cooperators were in a majority) and (b) how fairness was perceived across group compositions (members of groups with only cooperative members perceived the negotiations to be more fair than did members of groups that had one or more individualistic members).",

      "abstract": "Social security implies the realization of comprehensive guarantees to citizens from certain risks, most often socio-economic, but also others related to them, in an objective and subjective sense, which are integral parts of social security (social security, social protection, social development and social risks). Social security is often equated with social security, especially in its broader sense, although are not synonymous, and implies a comprehensive and integrated system of social measures that guarantee an adequate standard of living and well-being, can include a range of related systems and subsystems, ideas and concepts of security and other factors (economic, political, demographic, environmental, etc.) that are associated with it have a greater or lesser impact and determine the character of its actions. Social security is most directly related to human security and sustainable development. Achieving the highest possible level of social security is no longer just a possibility and ability of nation states but also of the entire global world system, with a system of international relations, which aspires to realize the idea and vision of a global society with a number of international supranational and global institutions, institutes and rules, who need to realize his premises. The central problem in the current form of globalization, as a system of international relations, is the constant increase of socio-economic inequalities and other inequalities, at the level of global society, between regions and states and within states and which is actualized as a result of structural inequalities stemming from neoliberalism, dominant economic-political model and its rules. As a consequence of endangering the socio-economic security of people and their identities, modern migrations with their risks appear, of which the capacity of migrations to become a terrismogenic factor (factor generic of terrorism) is of special importance. The paper deals with issues of social security and social risks; globalization, increasing socio-economic inequalities and social risks, and the relationship between social risks and migration as a terrismogenic factor, with reference to the analysis of migration risks in the Republic of Serbia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract “The workplace,” as described so far, is an intensely social environment. Coworkers routinely cooperate in doing the work itself—the most literal meaning of “working together.” They socialize informally during the workday and sometimes afterward. They discuss shared terms and conditions of employment and are sometimes moved to make common cause and to seek a collective voice in these matters. Some modicum of cooperation, sociability, and communication about shared work conditions is virtually endemic to “the workplace” as we know it. But there are plainly many different kinds of workplaces and many different kinds of jobs, and they vary enormously in their hospitality to each of these forms of human interaction. So, too, workplaces are changing to meet the challenges of a dynamic and increasingly global market. Do the actual workplaces of the twenty-first century look anything like “the workplace” I have described? Do they foster the kinds of social ties on which I stake my claims here?",

      "title": "Experience of vulnerability from a gypsy/travelling perspective : a phenomemological study",
      "abstract": "People can experience feeling vulnerable whenever their health or usual function is compromised and can increase when they enter unfamiliar surroundings, situations or relationships. One’s experience of vulnerability can also be heightened through interaction between the individual and the society within which they live. As such, vulnerability is a dynamic concept that crosses the interface between the self and the social world. It is, therefore, a key concept for professional practice; however this complex, elusive phenomenon is ill defined within the literature. Within studies of vulnerability it is the existential (lived) experience (emic perspective) that is the most silent in comparison to normative perspectives (etic perspective). The Gypsy/Travelling community are often normatively identified by researchers and professionals as a vulnerable group due to increased morbidity and mortality (Goward et al. 2006; Parry et al. 2007) as well as their marginalised status within society (Van Cleemput 2007; McCaffery 2009). But this tells little of the experience of feeling vulnerable by the individuals themselves, and yet without their stories and experiences how can professionals ensure that service developments meet their needs. This research addresses this gap in the evidence base by exploring the lived experience of vulnerability of a Gypsy/Travelling community. The study consisted of two phases (a breadth phase followed by a depth phase), after the work of Todres and Galvin (2005). The breadth phase (Phase 1) consisted of narrative interviews with five Gypsies and Travellers exploring times in their lives when they had felt vulnerable. This identified the following:  A feeling of vulnerability created by the potential or actual lack of physical travelling experience.  Fear of the future and declining physical health.  Being an outsider; this experience of vulnerability contained two similar but distinct variants. o Insider identity o Perception of others outside the Gypsy /Travelling community  Vulnerability connected to the ambiguities of their historical, cultural and geographical identity. Phase 2 explored the experience of vulnerability related to the ambiguities of their historical, cultural and geographical identity by exploring their experience of being part of a cultural group with threatened cultural identity and heritage. The lived experience of this type of vulnerability was described by 15 participants and descriptive phenomenological analysis (Giorgi 2009) identified six constituents of the phenomenon of vulnerability:  Vulnerability due to feeling defined and homogenised in a particular way  Vulnerability of feeling pressurised to conform to live a particular way  Vulnerability of feeling split in one’s identity  Vulnerability due to feeling a loss of one’s heritage  Vulnerability of feeling discriminated, persecuted and threatened  Vulnerability of powerlessness The findings of this study on the lived experience of vulnerability (emic) present a different perspective to vulnerability than what is already known from the literature (etic). This develops the understanding of the concept of vulnerability itself, which can enhance professional skill and knowledge when working with people who may be experiencing feeling vulnerable. In addition, this thesis illuminates a light on experiences of vulnerability of Gypsies and Travellers, largely hidden within society. This new knowledge of their stories can be used to influence policy as well as statutory services (health, education and social care). Lastly, the thesis proposes a new, novel theory to understand vulnerability, referred to as “Etemic”; a fusion between the emic and etic. It argues that it is only through an appreciation of the Etemic that services can be developed to effectively address the needs of individuals within the Gypsy/Travelling community.",

      "title": "The Importance of Social Groups for Retirement Adjustment: Evidence, Application, and Policy Implications of the Social Identity Model of Identity Change",
      "abstract": "Abstract Previous work in the social identity tradition suggests that adjustment to significant life changes, both positive (e.g., becoming a new parent) and negative (e.g., experiencing a stroke), can be supported by access to social group networks. This is the basis for the social identity model of identity change (SIMIC), which argues that, in the context of life transitions, well‐being and adjustment are enhanced to the extent that people are able to maintain preexisting social group memberships that are important to them or else acquire new ones. Building on empirical work that has examined these issues in the context of a variety of life transitions, we outline the relevance of SIMIC for one particular life transition: retiring from work. We identify four key lessons that speak to the importance of managing social group resources effectively during the transition to retirement from the workforce. These suggest that adjustment to retirement is enhanced to the extent that retirees: (1) can access multiple important group memberships and the psychological resources they provide, (2) maintain positive and valued existing groups, and (3) develop meaningful new groups, (4) providing they are compatible with one another. This theory and empirical evidence is used to introduce a new social intervention, Groups 4 Health , that translates SIMIC's lessons into practice. This program aims to guide people through the process of developing and embedding their social group ties in ways that protect their health and well‐being in periods of significant life change of the form experienced by many people as they transition into retirement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract To assimilate information is to organize it. There may perhaps exist highly structured scientific domains in which the explanatory principles used by researchers are sufficient in themselves to produce an ordering of all new information applicable to these domains. At first sight, however, this does not appear to apply to social psychology: the enormous mass of new information which accumulates each year in various journals, essay collections, and monographs is widely disparate. Nevertheless, certain major themes, such as differentiation and group formation, or autonomy and interdependence in interpersonal relations, do permit some organization of this particular area in the social sciences. Furthermore, these different polar themes are complementary, since in-depth investigation of one of these themes entails reference to its opposite; there can be no group formation without differentiation, no interdependence of individuals without autonomy and vice versa (see Doise et al. 1978).Another way of organizing the vast amount of research in social psychology takes into account the nature of the explanatory principles involved as well: these are the explanatory principles which relate to an individual’s organizational processes, to interpersonal dynamics, to asymmetrical social positioning in the context of social relations, and to the impact of social norms and representations. Elsewhere (Doise 1984) I have already demonstrated how important this distinction of levels of analysis is if we wish to account for the specificity of different studies of intergroup relations. It should also be remembered that we have distinguished among these four levels of analysis only so that we may demonstrate the need to articulate them at a theoretical level.",

Je trouve que les deux preferences sociales la lutte pour le statut et le maintien des relations s’entravent mutuellement: la lutte pour le statut diminue le gain des relations collaboratives, et une relation decourage l’esprit de competition lie a la lutte pour le statut. Les preferences sociales affectent egalement la formation et la retention des routines culturelles.

La relation entre les deux membres d'un groupe de trois permet aux deux premiers de s’engager dans la resolution coherente des problemes, cependant le groupe dans son ensemble utilise ses routines de maniere moins reguliere, et la retention de routines est alteree egalement.

While economic indices may in part accurately reflect absolute changes in the state of economic conditions, it is difficult to characterize the results of opinion polls on socially relevant problems as representative of public sentiment, simply because of noncomparability of the intensity of individual preferences. Preferences and quality of life may be rated differently depending upon prior experiences and the socioeconomic activities in which a person or family engages. Viewed in this light, a comparison of relative frequency of response to issues enumerated in a poll can often be misleading. While the methodology presented in this paper does not purport to overcome these problems in their entirety, it does incorporate variations in the intensity of individual perceptions of problems into a community preference ranking which may be used to facilitate decision-making.

      "title": "The model of contingent organization-public relationship : reconciling contingency and relationship management theory",
      "abstract": "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST.] Organization-public relationship, as a key concept of public relations, has been extensively examined by global scholars. In 1984, Ferguson first pointed out this term by stating that \"the unit of study should not be the organization, nor the public, nor the communication process. Rather, the unit of study should be the relationships between organizations and their publics.\" (abstract). In turns, Ledingham and Bruning (1998, 2000) provided a tentative definition of OPR and developed the relationship management theory as the conceptualization, which assumed that the aim of building a positive organization-public relationship (OPR) was to build mutual benefits. While in reality, the measurement of OPR could be complex: not only cooperation, competitions or conflicts co-existed between two parties, and dyadic or multiple parties at one time should be considered, but also proscriptions such as legal and moral factors constituted as contingencies of OPRs. Much of the existing studies analyzed OPR without monitoring it longitudinally or presenting the variation of relationship dynamically. Introduced in 1997, the contingency theory of conflict management, as another important approach in the field of public relations held a realistic view to track the dynamic stances and focused on dimensions that affected these stances on communication tactics. This theory was widely applied in interdisciplinary areas such as health and crisis communication for organizational strategic thinking, but was never applied to test the relationship between organizations and their publics. However, knowing what matters enables the organization to understand what cause the changes of relationships. The relationship management theory and contingency theory of conflict management can be integrated closely. Few studies, if any, have attempted to analyze OPR by bridging the gap between the above mentioned theories. This research is arguably the first attempt integrating contingency theory and relationship management theory and expanding knowledge on how each affects the other. Two dominant approaches in the field of public relations, bolstered by a tapestry of literature from cross-disciplinary fields, are brought together to conceptualize a model of Contingent Organization-Public Relationship (COPR). To generate the theoretical robustness of COPR and test its practical applicability, a social mediated crisis occurring in contemporary China was theoretically sampled and data were collected through mixed methods research including both content analyses and in-depth interviews. Quantitatively, content analyses of 338 RCSC's press releases and 4,003 media coverage and 136,754 public posts during the time range between June, 2011 and August, 2014 provided a natural history of the application of contingent organization-public relationship (COPR) in a social mediated crisis context. Qualitative interviews also offered rich and in-depth information on the perception of stances and relationships from each party in the relationship. Findings concluded that COPR addressed the dynamic and contingent multi-party relationships. The relationship between the RCSC and online publics moved from the highly conflictual side to the neutral side, and changed back to the original competitive types of relationships (i.e., competing and evading relationships). A similar trend of the change of relationship was also found between the RCSC and media. Cooperating relationship was seldom found during the three stages of the crisis, which supported the argument that both parties in crises maintain conflictual relationships for self-interests and may adopt strategies to achieve mutual benefits. Evidence also showed that several unique contingent variables in the Chinese context such as the powerful public-led agenda, heavily censored media landscape, and distrust towards the society as a whole played significant roles in determining an organization's stance and strategies employed. Overall, this study concluded by arguing that the contingent OPR (COPR) could exist and helped to explain the dynamic process between at least two parties who are in the state of cooperation, competition, or conflict, and consider to maximize their own interests beforehand. By synthesizing both approaches of relationship management theory and contingency theory of accommodation, the concept of COPR was forged to describe the information flow between an organization and one or more publics who are in the status ranging from mutually beneficial to highly conflictual. COPR accounts for this range and for the dynamism of ongoing relationship.",

We consider the role of Indigenous languages in motivating and sustaining collective action among Indigenous peoples, drawing on basic social psychological theory as well as insights from Indigenous writers. We contend that the knowledge and use of one’s Indigenous language can facilitate the psychological conditions shown to underpin interest in participating in collective action (i.e., collective identification, perceptions of injustice, collective control, and group boundary permeability). Our perspective highlights the fact that there may be unique predictors of collective action among Indigenous peoples. We discuss the importance of these ideas in light of the reality of language loss in many Indigenous groups, and call for social psychologists to increase their attention to issues of language and social justice, especially among Indigenous peoples.",

      "abstract": "Social Work draws from various disciplines but is perceived to be the direct opposite of corporate work, however, there is a need to work with the elite for the sake of social development due to their available resources and skills that social workers lack. While Corporate Social Responsibility typically takes the form of dole-outs on a voluntary basis, it has begun to transition into building partnerships with communities. Data from the Local Health System program of Zuellig Family Foundation was examined to (a) describe the developmental principles used by an elite foundation for the development and implementation of their program, (b) determine the intersection of the operations of the program with the Empowerment Theory and Developmental Perspective as practiced by the Social Work profession, and (c) discuss the role of social workers in corporate-led programs. Despite the surface differences of social work and corporate work, foundations of the elite can be effective contributors to social change and development, and can work with the Social Work profession in empowering communities that suffer from inequities. The findings of the study indicate that social work professionals and other humanities professions must explore partnerships with corporate-led foundations to deepen knowledge bases and ensure social development.&#x0D; &#x0D; Keywords: Social Work profession, Corporate Social Responsibility, Empowerment Theory, Developmental Perspective, Zuellig Family Foundation, Local Health System, partnership",

ABSTRACT The great challenge, task, or even the difficulty in this third millennium is to use the competences, capacities and skills in accordance with the general needs, and not only the specific ones. It is called governance the way that cultural habits and the political institutions can be aligned, in conjunction with the current economic system and with focus on improving the quality of life of those involved. Ethics is something so important and relevant to the professional and personal life of every being that is – as a general rule - at the top of the list of the people’s memory, because many of them want to be remembered only and simply by their ethical attitudes, their actions fair, as well as by the professional capacity.  Anyway, everyone is important and nobody does anything alone. We are all interdependent, in spite of the difficulties, not matter they are general or specific. When the focus is in business management and collective performance, which is the sum of the individual results, we bump into two very important concepts: citizenship and humanism. Key words : Inclusion. Systematized study. Social responsibility.

      "title": "Metodología para determinar localizaciones más sostenibles para conjuntos de vivienda social en Valdivia, Chile",
      "abstract": "Dentro de las múltiples decisiones que tienen que ver con el desarrollo de barrios de vivienda social en Chile, la localización de los conjuntos toma especial relevancia debido al potencial de facilitar, o no, la movilidad social, el acceso a mejores oportunidades, y la integración urbana (Sabatini y Brain, 2008). En este sentido la política de vivienda ha sido insuficiente, incluso incorporando incentivos específicos a mejorar la localización, aplica parámetros centralistas que no aportan a mejorar significativamente la condición de nuevos barrios en ciudades de menor tamaño, haciendo urgente la incorporación de un enfoque local.El Subsidio Diferenciado a la Localización (SDL) es parte de la política habitacional que trata de subsanar las falencias en materia habitacional y urbana que se han perpetuado por más de 30 años en Chile. Sin embargo, esta política no ha cumplido todos sus objetivos, ya que sus parámetros de localización permiten la ubicación de viviendas sociales en sectores con acceso deficiente a redes de equipamientos. Si bien se solicita informar la distancia de desplazamiento para aspectos como transporte, salud, educación en las fórmulas para obtener este incentivo, no incorporan, entre otros, medidas para desplazamientos a lugares de empleo (Brain y col., 2010).Es así, como se vuelve valioso el indagar en variables poco exploradas en esta toma de decisiones, como son las bases de datos masivas relacionadas a los datos geo-referenciados. Estas son una poderosa fuente de información para dar nuevas respuestas y aproximaciones a materias urbanas (Pentland, 2009).Considerando que hoy existen numerosas fuentes de datos para la mayoría de las ciudades, realidades como la de desplazamientos, flujos, usos de suelo, entre otros pueden comenzar a modelarse con una precisión elevada, en tiempo cuasi real, con menores costos y con alta confiabilidad. El volumen de información que proporcionan las antenas de telefonía móvil las hace capaces de describir trazas en distintos espacios temporales (día, semana, mes) y para distintos grupos, exponiendo cuánto, cómo y hacia dónde se mueven las personas en una ciudad (Hoteit y col., 2014).El presente estudio propone indicadores de sostenibilidad para zonas de residencia y destinos (Integración, Conectividad y Diversidad) y propuestas de criterios de proximidad y morfológicos para localizar nuevos barrios o mejorar los existentes desde acciones de regeneración urbana.En contraste con los criterios actuales de localización y medios de caracterización urbana, este trabajo representa una aproximación novedosa y válida para conocer la realidad urbana de forma contextualizada y complementaria a los instrumentos actuales, pero con potencial de reemplazarlos. Dins de les múltiples decisions que tenen a veure amb el desenvolupament de barris d'habitatge social a Xile, la localització dels conjunts pren especial rellevància a causa deL potencial de facilitar, o no, la mobilitat social, l'accés a millors oportunitats, i la integració urbana (Sabatini i Brain, 2008). En aquest sentit la política d'habitatge ha estat insuficient, fins i tot incorporant incentius específics a millorar la localització, aplica paràmetres centralistes que no aporten a millorar significativament la condició de nous barris en ciutats més petites, fent urgent la incorporació d'un enfocament local.El Subsidi Diferenciat a la Localització (SDL) és part de la política d’habitatge que tracta d'esmenar les mancances en matèria residencial i urbana que s'han perpetuat per més de 30 anys a Xile. No obstant això, aquesta política no ha complert tots els seus objectius, ja que els seus paràmetres de localització permeten la ubicació d'habitatges socials en sectors amb accés deficient a xarxes d'equipaments. Si bé es demana informar la distància de desplaçament per a aspectes com transport, salut, educació en les fórmules per obtenir aquest incentiu, no incorporen, entre d'altres, mesures per a desplaçaments a llocs d'ocupació (Brain i col., 2010).És així, com es torna valuós el indagar en variables poc explorades en aquesta presa de decisions, com són les bases de dades massives relacionades a les dades geo-referenciats. Aquestes són una poderosa font d'informació per donar noves respostes i aproximacions a matèries urbanes (Pentland, 2009).Considerant que avui hi ha nombroses fonts de dades per a la majoria de les ciutats, realitats com la de desplaçaments, fluxos, usos de sòl, entre d'altres poden començar a modelar amb una precisió elevada, en temps quasi real, amb menors costos i amb alta fiabilitat . El volum d'informació que proporcionen les antenes de telefonia mòbil les fa capaços de descriure traces en diferents espais temporals (dia, setmana, mes) i per a diferents grups, exposant quant, com i cap a on es mouen les persones en una ciutat (Hoteit i col., 2014).El present estudi proposa indicadors de sostenibilitat per a zones de residència i destinacions (Integració, Connectivitat i Diversitat) i propostes de criteris de proximitat i morfològics per localitzar nous barris o millorar els existents des accions de regeneració urbana.En contrast amb els criteris actuals de localització i mitjans de caracterització urbana, aquest treball representa una aproximació nova i vàlida per conèixer la realitat urbana de forma contextualitzada i complementària als instruments actuals, però amb potencial de reemplaçar-los. Within the multiple decisions related to the development of social housing neighborhoods in Chile, the location of the complexes is especially relevant because of their potential to facilitate, or not, social mobility, access to better opportunities, and urban integration (Sabatini and Brain, 2008). In this sense, the housing policy has been insufficient, although it has incorporated specific incentives to improve the location, they are centralist application parameters that do not contribute to improving the condition of new neighborhoods in smaller cities, making the generation of incentives with a local approach.The Differential Location Grant (SDL) is part of the housing policy that seeks to address the deficiencies in housing and urban matters that have been perpetuated for more than 30 years in Chile. However, this policy has not fulfilled all its objectives, since its location parameters allow the location of social housing in sectors with poor access to equipment networks. Although it is requested to report the distance of travel for aspects such as transportation, health, and education in the formulas to obtain this incentive, they do not include, among others, measures for travel to places of employment (Brain et al., 2010).This is how it becomes valuable to investigate less explored variables in this decision-making, such as massive databases related to geo-referenced data. These are a powerful source of information to gather new responses and approaches to urban issues (Pentland, 2009).Taking into account that today there are numerous data sources for most of all cities, realities such as displacements, flows, land uses, among others, can begin to be modeled with high accuracy, in near-real time, with lower costs and Highest reliability. The volume of information provided by mobile phone antennas makes them capable of describing traces in different time-spaces (day, week, month) and for different groups, exposing how much, how and where people move in a city (Hoteit and col., 2014).Using the urban ICT capabilities, sustainability indicators have been described for areas of residence and destinations (Integration, Connectivity, and Diversity) and proposals for proximity and morphological criteria to locate new neighborhoods or improve existing ones from urban regeneration actions.In contrast to the current criteria of location and forms of urban characterization, this work represents a novel and valid approach to know the urban reality in a contextualized manner and complementary to the current instruments, but with the potential to replace them.",

      "abstract": "Scholars who adopt an interpretive methodology sooner or late must confront the question: how best to handle a political actor’s words? According to an “interpretive” methodological outlook, political actors (regardless if we are talking about a prim-and proper government grandee or an impolite street protester) are not simply pushed and pulled around by the incentives and threats dangled by the social environment and by political circumstances. They carry with them their own perceptions, beliefs, intentions, and desires; these independently inform, shape, direct, and motivate action. Thought infuses (and is inextricable from) political practice. In addition, interpretive political scientists insist that the content of actors’ beliefs should not be identified a priori – for example, by assuming the existence of a universal instinct for self-interest, material gain or social status – but should involve the direct participation of actors. The rigorous study of politics requires listening sympathetically to what political actors say about how they see, reason about, and act in the world.",

These ideas are often not put into words but are carried into social work from society generally. Social work with old people is perceived as so peripheral to mainstream social work theory and practice that concepts such as Marxism and feminism have barely touched it. Where they have touched the predicament of older people, they have shed some useful light. The criticism of social workers perceiving the needs of elderly people as social service rather than social work needs is not meant to be a criticism of those social services or, indeed, a view of social work that precludes service delivery. Social workers, like the rest of society, can have a very passive image of older people.",

      "title": "Is There Any Collaborative Governance on Post-disaster Social Policy in Banten Province?",
      "abstract": "Social policies include increased social protection, approaches to improving living standards, and access to decent work. The description discusses two concepts, namely collaborative governance and the concept of social policy. Methodologically and technically, the two concepts are side by side in the context of implementing decentralization policies. Collaborative governance as collaboration is a relationship designed to solve a problem through the creation of solutions in conditions that are full of limitations (Ansell &amp; Gash, 2008). At the same time, the social policy responds to social problems, which tends to ignore the assessment of some people that they are not in a socially problematic condition (Spicker, 2014). social policy has many forms, such as health, education, housing, and other social services. The method uses a descriptive qualitative and qualitative verification analysis strategy model. Post-disaster handling, collaborative governance is applied through the government's efforts to carry out recovery that focuses on the residential, economic, infrastructure, social and cross-sectoral sectors. The results also show obstacles in collaborative governance, such as delays in building houses for the community, mismatch of specifications between what was promised and what was received by the community, and low public understanding. This study also shows that post-disaster management collaborative governance can be implemented using several strategies divided by sector and sub-sector; the right communication pattern increases community involvement in the entire post-disaster management process in Banten province. All strategies would be better if packaged in the form of government innovation. This means that post-disaster management, especially in repair and development efforts, is an important agenda for government collaboration.",

There exist also other social factors which are capable of fulfilling the social functions of religion (parties, ideologies) and which can be consi dered as being substitutes. By the fact that it is among other things a social reality, religion does have an influence upon social structures, but it acts in the first place on the cultural system.

      "abstract": "The implementation of public assistance and related forms of social insurance, based on existing social welfare legislation, often discriminates against new and emerging social institutions such as collective families residing in a communal situation. A recent case study of the Danish experience has shown that, while members of such communes are in fact discriminated against by the authorities (as a communal entity), the system has simultaneously proven flexible enough to accomodate the majority of \"problem cases\" on an individual basis and in the process served to minimize potential social unrest and dislocation. Unlike their American counterpart, research has verified that the Danes have generally been much more successful in resolving conflict situations, inter alia among their growing communal constituents, through an effective combination of the following factors: (a) the overwhelming majority of Danish communalists tend to work with and through the system (rather than against it, as is more often the case in the United States) and are generally not isolated from their respective communities; (b) they do not have large families with attendant social-medical problems necessitating major social intervention, but are likewise well educated and articulate enough to press for their own demands from their respective local authorities if and when necessary; (c) Danish authorities and institutions of social control simultaneously tolerate, partially subsidize, and in many other ways effectively co-opt the commune movement; and, (d) in practice social workers have proven innovative enough to apply existing social welfare laws and regulations on an individual basis when proven cases of need are brought to their attention. *The data on which this article is based w",

For Lyotard, performativity is both a culture and technology, in which regulation serves to drive performance against generalised standards. Lyotard's performativity has been hugely popularised in the literature of educational sociology, most notably in the UK in the work of Stephen Ball. Placed in a national context, performativity in the UK has extended to a range of public services where audit technologies are now commonly used to regulate and valorise forms of institutional processes and outcomes. In the Lyotardian meaning of the concept, the 'reach' of performativity is not simply restricted to the technologies of schooling but, as Lyotard argues, it is a culture. In this regard, the power of performativity lies in its ability to both affect and shape personal and collective behaviour.",

Given the multitude of sport forms and the vast variety of specific sports, ranging from rural, primitive athletic folk games of old, to new urban, hi tech, extreme sports, this definition is unlikely to satisfy one‐and‐all. It does, however, (1) highlight the major social characteristics of modern sport; (2) suggest the specification of the embodied structural properties and social processes underlying the social development of modern sport; and (3) provide a set of common features for examining the magnitude and complexity of sport as a social phenomenon at different levels of analysis, including sport as a unique game occurrence, sport as a particular type of ludic activity, sport as an institutionalized game, sport as a social institution, and sport as a form of social involvement (Loy 1968).",

      "title": "Social diffusion and global drift in adaptive social networks",
      "abstract": "Social contagion has been studied in various contexts. Many instances of social contagion can be modeled as an infection process where a specific state (adoption of product, fad, knowledge, behavior, etc.) spreads from individual to individual through links between them. In the meantime, other forms of social contagion may better be understood as a diffusion process where the state of an individual tends to assimilate with the social norm (i.e., local average state) within his/her neighborhood. Unlike infection scenarios where influence is nonlinear, unidirectional, fast, and potentially disruptive, social diffusion is linear, bidirectional, gradual, and converging. The distance between an individual's state and his/her neighbors' average state always decreases, and thus a homogeneous global state is guaranteed to be the network's stable equilibrium state in the long run. This does not sound as intriguing or exciting as infection dynamics, which might be why there are very few studies on mathematical models of social diffusion processes. Here, this study attempts to shed new light on an unrecognized characteristic of social diffusion, i.e., non-trivial drift it can cause to the network's global average state. Although somewhat counterintuitive, such global drift is indeed possible because, unlike physical diffusion processes, social diffusion processes are not conservational. In what follows, a mathematical model of social diffusion will be presented to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon, and some possible collective actions for influencing the direction of global drift will be proposed. The relevance of social diffusion to individual and collective improvement will be discussed briefly, with an emphasis on educational applications.",

      "title": "The need for an emotional work survey",
      "abstract": "Surveys of emotions offer great potential to understand micro-social dynamics and wellbeing not only within small groups, but within nations as a whole. The most commonly reported emotions in surveys – happiness, satisfaction, loneliness, etc hint at the social experiences of people from different class, ethnic, marital backgrounds, etc. However, such questions are usually generalised to ‘whole of life’ or domain-specific (eg work, family, etc) assessments. They are unable to capture the micro-social dynamics of interaction, power, and status, and consequently lose much of the social interplay of emotions. Many ‘social’ emotions – guilt, shame, anger, envy – are consequently not captured, nor is the considerable work done in managing emotions in different social situations, and the gender context that surrounds this. This paper identifies several emotions commonly ‘missing’ from social surveys and often subject to considerable emotion work particularly amongst women, including anger (Kemper 1990; Holmes 2004), shame (Kemper 1990; Scheff 1991), and jealousy/ envy (Clanton 1996). Building on the innovative work of Kahneman and Krueger’s (2006), it also suggests that the most appropriate method for measuring the common emotions and emotion work undertaken in actual social settings is to run a time-use survey with open-ended questions about emotions. Such a survey would ask respondents to report which emotions they felt in their own words, and whether they felt the need to hide or alter these emotions, for a random selection of time-based episodes about any emotions. Such an ‘audit’ of emotions and emotion work in time-based context would provide valuable data to substantiate many of the theories promulgated by sociologists of emotion, and reveal important gender dimensions to emotions within households and families.",

What all the diverse usages do agree upon is that their referent is some sort of non‐private arena of social life and most judge that arena to be both critically beneficial and unappreciated; what they disagree about is its exact character.

More specifically, it shows how new forms of blame and moral condemnation of the poor have emerged, together with public rhetoric based on the social representation of the poor as unable to provide for themselves and to self-organize, in need of \"good\" advice, or idle people requiring explicit and implicit forms of workfare. Our focus on these themes aims to shine some light on one aspect of poverty that is less commonly investigated (even by sociologists), but which is of great importance for public sociology, namely the lack of recognition, or the misrecognition of the poor. However, we do not intend to underestimate the broad question of economic inequality, given that in order for poor people to overcome the stigma of poverty and to recover their capacity to act and to make decisions, there has to be a greater, more equitable distribution of resources.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "Since the early days of humankind, trust has been an essential factor for establishing and maintaining cooperative and mutually beneficial interpersonal relationships with strangers, friends, family members, etc., impacting our social interactions across all aspects of our private and public lives in a wide range of social, economic, and political contexts. Portraying a social dilemma, trust can be conceptualized as a trustor’s investment of resources (e.g., money, time, energy) into another party (i.e., a trustee) that encompasses uncertainty regarding the benefits of reciprocation in the future, thus opening up the possibilities for deceiving and cheating in human society. These interpersonal trust decisions – ranging from small (e.g., trusting that a stranger provides you with a correct route description) to large (e.g., trusting your spouse to be faithful) transactions – are imperative for shaping our social lives and have cascading positive and negative consequences. When people trust each other, society is more inclusive and accessible, economic transactions are facilitated, and feelings of well-being prosper (Rothstein & Uslaner, 2005; Simpson, 2007; Zak & Knack, 2001). For example, the current unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted the significance of trust in regulating our social lives. We not only trust our political leaders to tell the truth about the impact of this virus but also that others take the necessary precautions (e.g., social distancing, wearing face coverings, limiting unnecessary contact, self-isolation and quarantining in the case of an infection) to slow the spread of the virus.",

      "title": "Full participation matters? A subject orientated approach to participation from a capability perspective",
      "abstract": "Participation seems to be a constitutive characteristic of democratic societies and welfare regimes. Nevertheless, in its predominant language use, this concept focuses more on the articulation of interests and the formal involvement of citizens in political decision-making processes, and much less on the equal access to (political) power, social rights, common goods and the freedom to choose. While the prevalent definitions of participation are classifying types and degrees of participation into different levels (that is, the ladder of participation) and thus falling back into the less helpful differentiation of participation and non-participation, it seems to be useful to adapt a persistent subject orientated – but not individualistic – approach to participation. As such this chapter develops a broad concept of participation, which goes far beyond the normal understanding of involvement ('being engaged') in acknowledging the democratic dimension ('having a say') as well as the material dimension ('having a stake'). Finally, these dimensions are specified for processes and outcomes of participatory research called the 3Cs: creation, confrontation, constitution.",

This assertion is valid across the whole range of social work activities, whether we interpret these as a means of exercising more effective social control or as a way of enhancing the quality of life for individuals and groups within an established political, social and economic structure. At this juncture, however, we are not afforded the continuity of 'eternal things', either in relation to problems which social workers are legitimately expected to confront or with regard to appropriate means of tackling these at a professional and organisational level. We are still faced with questions concerning the interpretation of social problems, the organisation of resources, development of appropriate skills and the identification of potentially successful methods of intervention. Social workers act within the context of political power, ideological debate, economic constraints, changing social and demographic conditions, legally circumscribed choices, as well as responding to professional issues of theory and practice.",

En diversos lugares, y en especial pero no solamente en el contexto político, se observa un interesante número de iniciativas de diálogo y concertación que son objeto de respuesta positiva de parte de las personas convocadas, la prensa y amplios sectores sociales. Para quienes creemos que es mejor la resolución suma positiva de los conflictos, esta tendencia es saludable y satisfactoria, especialmente cuando en muchos países del mundo1 vemos a diario las terribles consecuencias de la agresión, la violencia, y la búsqueda de desenlaces suma cero.2No obstante, se escucha con alguna frecuencia la pregunta que constituye el título de este artículo: ¿Ayudan los diálogos a resolver problemas sociales? No falta el escepticismo al respecto. La respuesta que acá se ofrece es que los procesos de diálogo social pueden ayudar, y mucho, aunque no siempre lo hacen.El grado de su potencial contribución depende de varios factores. Este artículo explora varios de los más importantes, incluidos la definición de objetivos, la elección de temas y participantes, la dinámica comunicacional, los marcos conceptuales y metodológicos y los procesos a base de los cuales se puede asegurar el mayor éxito.La exploración de estos temas no está huérfana de teoría o de experiencias e investigaciones que la convaliden.

On the one hand, such a process necessitates a newly mature sense of one's own identity, which in turn entails a redefinition of the roles one plays socially, particularly with regard to new social groups. On the other hand, adulthood means acquiring new skills, knowledge, and know-how, all of which the young adult will need in order to play new social and professional roles. These two aspects of becoming an adult have traditionally been studied separately: School, the place where skills are acquired, is the focus in some studies; and social groups, wherein young people develop their sense of identity and social skills, are the focus in other studies. Some innovative studies have addressed both issues concurrently, however, showing that socialization and the construction of identity may also take place at school (Coulon, this volume) and that social groups often allow young people to acquire certain complex skills (Heath, Hundeide, this volume).",

Drawing on sociolinguistic micro‐analysis of gender‐based evidence from an interpreted asylum interview in the Belgian asylum procedure, this study shows how the (re)performance of gender issues is deeply embedded in and therefore cannot be understood outside the specific socio‐discursive dynamics and the broader institutional context of the asylum interview.",

      "title": "Socially Innovative Initiatives in Deprived Rural Areas of Germany, Ireland and Portugal: Exploring Empowerment and Impact on Community Development",
      "abstract": "In many (remote) rural areas of Europe and the world, rural communities are facing various challenges. One response is residents leaving their communities. However, there are also many empirical examples of residents staying, launching project initiatives, developing new solutions and experimenting with new practices. This is what we call social innovation. What experiences do actors have in these processes? Can we speak of empowerment? To what extent can such initiatives have an impact on community development? In this article, we explore these questions, for which there is little related empirical research. By applying a multi-sited individualising comparison to case studies in three European countries (Germany, Ireland and Portugal), we obtain empirical evidence of the following dimensions of empowerment that Avelino et al. outline conceptually: the achievement of autonomy, competence and relatedness and also impact, meaning and resilience. Often, however, it is not the individual actors for whom such effects can be reported. Rather, the social initiative as such or the local administration has acquired new skills and autonomy. Regarding community development, ‘pathways to impact’, such as infrastructure improvements and/or the creation of new employment opportunities and/or the influx of new residents, could be identified. However, this development often depended on both opportunity and the cooperation and goodwill of many stakeholders.",

      "title": "Symposium Issue on Social Simulation",
      "abstract": ">> Social simulation is the study of social phenomena by means of computer models where the microlevel behavior, interaction, and the social environment are explicitly modeled with a view to understanding their macro outcomes. Although relevant progress in social simulation has been made toward understanding important complex social puzzles, including urban segregation patterns, social norms, opinion dynamics, and market behavior (e.g., Edmonds & Ruth, 2013), this field has developed more on the transdisciplinary edges, rather than within the mainstream of the social sciences. This has the result that it has higher recognition in disciplines such as computer sciences, behavioral sciences, physics, and ecology than in the social sciences, with which it shares its subject matter. This pattern of impact was confirmed by a recent analysis of the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, the flagship social simulation journal, where Squazzoni and Casnici (2013) found that social simulation articles cited a lot of the social science literature but were themselves cited more outside social sciences. They argued that social simulation is a cross-disciplinary field that is doing more to disseminate social science concepts and topics into distant fields than it has been effective at changing social sciences from the within (see also Meyer, Lorscheid, & Troitzsch, 2009; Meyer, Zaggl, & Carley, 2011). While we do not underestimate the importance of cross-disciplinary domains and crossfertilization between disciplines, with this special issue we aim to strengthen links between social simulation and the wider social sciences by showing how this approach can help explain relevant social science puzzles. Thus, we have included a representative variety of studies, from quantitative to more qualitative oriented analyses, so as to give a comprehensive overview of the potentials of this technique. In this way, we hope to show how social simulation can help fill a gap between quality and quantity, logic reasoning and measurement, which is one of the main problems in the social science (e.g., Squazzoni, 2012). The issue starts with an overview on social simulation provided by Flaminio Squazzoni, Wander Jager, and Bruce Edmonds. where important challenges of this approach for the development of social sciences are discussed. A particular focus is on the role of behavioral heterogeneity and the interplay of social behavior and structure, which are typically out of the scope of more established social science approaches, such as quantitative sociology and economics.",

      "title": "Presidential Address: Parameters of Social Structure",
      "abstract": "Social structures are defined by their parameters the criteria underlying the differentiation among people and governing social interaction, such as sex, race, socioeconomic status, and power. The analysis of various forms of differentiation, their interrelations, and their implications for integration and change is the distinctive task of sociology. Two generic types of differentiation are heterogeneity and status inequality. Nominal parameters divide people into subgroups and engender heterogeneity. Graduated parameters differentiate people in terms of status rankings and engender inequality. The macrosocial integration of the diverse groups in modern society rests on its multiform heterogeneity resulting from many crosscutting parameters. For although heterogeneity entails barriers to social intercourse multiform heterogeneity undermines these barriers and creates structural constraints to establish intergroup relations. Crosscutting lines of differentiation thus foster processes of social integration, and they also foster processes of recurrent change. Strongly interrelated parameters impede these processes of integration and adjustment, however. (Such relationships between parameters for example, between the occupation and income of individuals must not be confused with the relationships between forms of differentiation for example, between the division of labor and income inequality in societies.) Pronounced correlations of parameters reveal a consolidated status structure, which intensifies inequalities and discourages intergroup relations and gradual change. The growing concentration of resources and powers in large organizations and their top executives poses a serious threat of structural consolidation in contemporary society.",

      "title": "Organizing for social change and innovation: Challenges and opportunities of organizations",
      "abstract": "A diverse range of organizations, encompassing for-profit organizations, social enterprises, non-profit and public organizations, are driven by a strong social mission to resolve societal challenges and drive social change. Such organizing necessarily involves navigating complexity in the form of potentially competing values (e.g., Gehman, Trevino & Garud, 2012), institutional logics, organizational forms and identities (Smith & Besharov, 2019). Often, in order to balance the competing needs for innovation and stability, organizations are forced to “deviate from socially legitimate templates for organizing and thus experience unique organizing challenges” (Battilana & Lee, 2014, p. 397). Research has shown that many organizations which navigate complexity and combine opposing elements struggle to maintain a balance between their various aims (Smith, Gonin, & Besharov, 2013) and experience mission drift (Besharov & Smith, 2014; Ramus & Vaccaro, 2017), often resulting in the abandonment of social aims in favour of commercial goals (Mair, Battilana & Cardenas, 2012). Scholars have recognized that most organizations cope with a multiplicity of opposing demands – mostly social and commercial – to some degree (Shepherd, Williams & Zhao, 2019), for example with for-profit organizations increasingly engaging in the generation of social value and not-for profit organizing engaging in commercial activities to substitute their traditional sources of income. Yet our understanding of how organizations can resolve challenges and instead leverage the unique opportunities they face remains vague. Building on existing research, the aim of this symposium is to explore the challenges and opportunities of organizing from various angles. The presenters will explore key questions that individually and collectively enhance our understanding of how organizing efforts can drive social change. To accomplish this, each paper draws on different theoretical lenses and empirical contexts. Changing hybrid organizations – The role of values Presenter: Janina Klein; Vrije U.

Diferentes esfuerzos se han realizado para superar esta situación, con el compromiso de entidades gubernamentales y de las mismas comunidades para involucradas, buscando un desarrollo social y humano. Sin embargo, los resultados de dichos esfuerzos son diversos y no siempre los mejores, dado el nivel de apropiación y mantenimiento de las tecnologías mismas, además de la conflictividad que aqueja dichas poblaciones rurales. En conjunto, tales situaciones impiden un manejo sostenible de las diversas tecnologías energéticas. Para analizar este problema desde un enfoque holístico, el pensamiento sistémico y más específicamente la dinámica de sistemas [7], reúne todas las características necesarias para realizar un análisis exhaustivo, que permita involucrar las posibles relaciones entre los entes que conforman el problema de la evolución de las tecnologías energéticas en una comunidad rural, los impactos de la misma en tal región y la forma en la cual las políticas públicas ayudan a una correcta utilización de la tecnología. Tal análisis, permite la identificación de los problemas más significativos, la evaluación de políticas y la simulación del comportamiento de las mismas a través del tiempo. Dada la implementación del problema y el proceso de solución, se observará de manera clara la forma en la cual se deben enfocar los esfuerzos institucionales, la construcción de capital social y humano, además de la manera en la cual se debe llevar a cabo el proceso de aprendizaje tecnológico.",

      "title": "Framing substance use disorders among forcibly displaced people through a syndemics lens.",
      "abstract": "Abstract Syndemics are synergistically interacting epidemics (for example, the epidemics of substance use disorders and forced displacement) in a particular context with shared drivers such as pre-existing political, structural, social and health conditions. Policymakers may ask what the risks of and needs are for forcibly displaced people with regards to substance use disorder (SUD). Working from a syndemics framework, we would argue that multiple risk and resiliency factors relating to both forced displacement and SUD work synergistically, and impact more significantly upon some populations than others. These risk factors include structural inequality and racism, social deprivation, violence, homelessness, trauma, childhood adversity, and co-morbid physical and mental health disorders. Individuals may become vulnerable while experiencing displacement, during transition, settlement or resettlement, and also through their life across and across generations. In this perspective, our answers to policymakers becomes more nuanced. We may argue for integrated, multi-modal interventions, cross-disciplinary collaborations, cross-pollination of ideas and knowledge and embedding lived experience to bridge gaps and make use of limited resources in sustainable ways. This presentation will detail aspects of the application of a syndemic lens to the evidence base on SUD among forcibly displaced people and generate discussion on what scientists, clinicians and policymakers can and may do with these insights.

      "abstract": "Charles Manski's article (Manski [2009]) addresses a fundamental question: how to make policy decisions under ambiguity, i.e., when objective probabilities are unknown. Specifically, the article asks how a social planner should assign a continuum of individuals to one of two treatments. Two cases are analyzed: one in which treatment effects are individual, and one in which there are social interactions, meaning that the treatment choice for one group affects the well-being of the other group. The article offers the following formal foundation for planning under ambiguity: The social planner has to (a) choose a social welfare function, (b) assess the feasible states of nature, (c) select a criterion for decision-making under ambiguity. The framework thus abstracts from problems of finding the welfare function or defining the possible states of the world, i.e., the article does not analyze cases in which the social planner does not even feel comfortable with writing down possible events and their consequences in a utilitarian manner. But even when (a) and (b) pose no problems, it is not yet clear what decision should be taken, because typically one decision is optimal in one state, while another is optimal in another state. In order to decide, the social planner must somehow give weights to the states, which he can do by assigning subjective probabilities. He can then rank the decisions according to the expected welfare they generate, which is the familiar Bayesian decision criterion.",

      "abstract": "There has been some discussion recently of 'coping' or 'survival strategies', practised by schoolteachers (Hargreaves, 1977, 1978, 1979; Woods, 1979, 1980a, b, 1981; Lacey, 1977; Pollard, 1981). Interest has focused on identifying and describing the various types, and analysing the ways in which they represent the resolution of tensions or contradictions set up when social constraint meets personal intention. In this exposition, some attention has been given to humour, a means of communication and self-expression which is common to many teacher and pupil strategies. However, its full import as a coping agency in schools has not, as yet, been realised. In other institutions it has been shown to be a powerful resource in interpersonal relations in several ways, integrating, differentiating, liberating and at times constraining (Martineau, 1972). As an instrument to protect and develop the self, as political weapon to defend against or strike at an enemy, as a social regulator to highlight norms, as a bargaining counter, or as a cement for social relationshumour has been shown to be used in all these ways (Martineau, 1972). Rarely, however, have all these functions been observed operating in the same institution at the same time; and never has the one principle common to most forms of humour-i.e. its coping nature-been adequately explained sociologically. Observation of humour and laughter within schools presses for rectification of these omissions.",

The need for an identity includes the urge (conscious and unconscious) to use in any communication situation your “own” language naturally learned during the first years of life. The need for mutual understanding consists in the fact that each member of the communication situation wants freely to communicate with their conversation partners, no matter what their first language is. In the majority of countries the government’s conscious language policy as well as the spontaneous policy via “economic turnover” are aimed, first of all, at supporting the need for mutual understanding. The minority language speakers’ need for an identity often suffers and it can lead to conflicts. It is noted that only in Soviet Russia and the USSR of the 1920-1930s there was an attempt – though only partially successful – to take the need for an identity as a basis for the language policy.

Although many successful models of physical and biological systems have been developed, it has been found more difficult to model large social systems. Much of the difficulty can be attributed to the attempt to use functional models adapted from the physical sciences that are not suitable for the essentially relational context of social systems. If specifically relational models are used, it becomes possible to capture much of the complexity missed by functional models. Guidelines for the use of relational models for social systems are proposed, and several widely used relational models are described and evaluated.",

      "title": "Issues of power in relation to gender and sexuality in the EFL classroom - An overview",
      "abstract": "Schools in general and classrooms in particular are among society’s primary socializing institutions (Freeman & McElhinny, 1996, p. 261; Adger, 2001). In particular, education, as an institu‐ tion of Gramsci’s ‘civil society’ (Jones, 2006), can be considered a grassroots space where hegemonic gendered and sexual identities are constructed and regulated. This article looks at the context of the EFL classroom – a discursive space where learners are potentially (re‐)constructed in relation to various (gender) roles in society as well as learning the practices, values and rules of a given society at large. In this paper we explore and discuss how the categories of gender and sexuality are repre‐ sented, (re‐)constructed and generally dealt with in this learning environment. We follow Foucault’s (1978, 1979) conceptualization of power as something which “weaves itself discursively through social organizations, meanings, relations and the construction of speakers’ subjectivities or identities” (Baxter, 2003, p. 8) and is enacted and contested in every interaction (see Mullany, 2007). We see power as being produced, reproduced, challenged and resisted in the EFL classroom in connection with the construction of gender and sexuality. The article discusses how views on what/who is ‘powerful’ in the context of the EFL classroom have changed over the years, from the early privileging of textbooks to the currently advocated central role of the teacher in addressing and promoting (or not) traditional and/or progressive discourses of gender and sexuality. Critical pedagogies and queer pedagogies are discussed as offering educators potent insights and tools to deal with heteronorma‐ tivity and various forms of discrimination in the EFL classroom as well as helpful means for empow‐ ering all students by addressing their various identities. It is thus our contention that relationships between gender, sexuality and EFL education are in need of urgent (re)addressing as existing re‐ search is outdated, lacks methodological sophistication or is lacking in the Polish context.",

It is not a singular issue but a group one, and in particular those social groups which in different places and times had gained social trust and did abuse that trust in a certain way. There is also a cultural and social problem – i.e. such “experts” are both conditioned in their aspirations qualifications by certain cultural and social reality as well, thanks to their special position in that reality, they had and still have significant influence on such a transformation of this reality to make it create a convenient circumstances for their agency. It all makes me treat these remarks (using a court language) not as a charge of specific people, but speaking in a specific case.",

      "abstract": "The sociocultural aspects of sport injury and recovery include the broad landscape of social beliefs, climates, processes, cultures, institutions, and societies that surround the full chronological spectrum of sport injury outcomes, ranging from risk through to rehabilitation and retirement. A social ecological view of research on this topic demonstrates that sociocultural influences affect sport injury outcomes via interrelated sport systems extending from the intrasystem (i.e., within sports persons) through the microsystem (i.e., sport relationships), mesosystem (i.e., sport organizations), exosystem (i.e., sport governing bodies), and macrosystem (i.e., sport cultures). Affected sport injury outcomes include sport injury risks and responses during rehabilitation, return to play, and retirement from sport. Some specific examples of sociocultural themes evident in research literature include personal conformity to the cultural expectation to play hurt, social conventions of behavior when sport injuries occur, institutional character or ethics when making return to play decisions, guidelines for the care of athletes prescribed by sport governing bodies, and the economic costs to society for sport injuries. Many elements of sport injury are affected by these sociocultural influences, such as the risk of injuries, rehabilitation processes, and career terminations. Continuing debates and discussions include advocacy for sport rule changes, bans on dangerous sports, institutional responsibility, and global sport safety efforts. These form the basis for recommendations about sociocultural interventions designed to reduce sport injury risks and optimize effective injury recoveries through social and cultural best practices.",

      "abstract": "A lo largo de la historia personas en situacion de discapacidad se han visto discriminadas en diversos escenarios de su vida cotidiana. Como lo ha sostenido la Corte Constitucional, las ciudades se han construido bajo el paradigma del sujeto completamente habilitado. La educacion, la recreacion, el transporte, los lugares y los medios de trabajo, incluso el imaginario colectivo de felicidad, se fundan en la idea de una persona que se encuentra en pleno ejercicio de todas sus capacidades fisicas y mentales. (Sentencia C-559 de 2001). En ultimas decadas ha evolucionado el concepto y tratamiento de la discapacidad, superandose la idea que atribula su origen a aspectos religiosos o cientificos, ubicando por el contrario su causa en un entamo social inadecuadamente dispuesto. Se encuentra en el interior de esta concepcion, que es la forma como esta estructurada la sociedad la que provoca la discapacidad al dificultar o impedir la satisfaccion de necesidades e intereses propios de cada individuo y su participacion en los diferentes ambitos sociales; postulando, en consecuencia, que corresponde a la misma comunidad la realizacion de acciones positivas que propendan por la eliminacion de barreras que se configuraron en su diseno. Conforme a los anteriores postulados, propios de la teoria del modelo social de tratamiento de personas en situacion de discapacidad, con un analisis doctrinal, jurisprudencial y normativo, en el presente texto se evidencia la necesidad de garantizar la integracion e inclusion de personas en situacion de discapacidad de manera plena y en igualdad de condiciones, y la vital importancia de la efectiva y plena satisfaccion de los derechos a la movilidad y al transporte publico para el cumplimiento de estos objetivos.",

      "abstract": "A social community as the main structure of people's social functioning is an interdisciplinary subject for study. Its different definitions accentuate social interactions in social communities irrespective of the basis and purpose of their unity. The authors focused on territorial communities (urban and country residents) as the primary community where social interaction takes place and social connections are formed in a certain location. Empirical findings obtained in the framework of RFBR grant no. 19-411-340002 \"Territorial communities in social transformation: sociological and managerial analysis\" permit an analysis of processes taking place in territorial communities at the time of social transformation. Most provincial Russian regions, towns and villages show low social activism, apathetic social behavior devoid of initiative. Among the characteristic features of social anomie experienced by territorial communities, the authors also emphasize low or moderate degree of trust on social institutions and other people, half-faced loyalty to one's community, poor solidary ties inside a territorial community which obstruct social interactions and put the very existence of a territorial community at stake. Besides, the state of a territorial community may be a which may be a response to social change, crises, and the depressive vector of regional development. The inert social environment, a condition of social anomie represents the greatest difficulty in management since it is marked by latent conflict and \"alienated sociality\". The authors consider different scenarios of development of a territorial community and overcoming disunity as a response to social transformations and inequality. Understanding the new social reality of towns and villages, the meanings and practices found in the interactions of urban and country residents in the ever-changing social landscape can help in overcoming social anomie, developing a territorial identity and solidary relations in the region, and preserving the community.",

It should combine an openness of education with its general availability at all levels, in the interaction of interested parties and, above all, the state, in all components of this process in order to preserve society’s intellectual potential. Scientific analysis of any phenomenon involves considering it from several positions. Nowadays, modern society is going through complex processes of revaluation of basic values in all spheres of life - material, spiritual, socio-political, social (in the narrow sense) against the background of various activation of the human factor in the above areas. The analysis of global problems should consider the principal objects of influence of these problems and the subjects whose activities cause their aggravation. In other words, it is necessary to distinguish between the spheres of interaction between the individual, nature, society (in this case, the world community), which comprises states with different forms of social structure, economy, national-state organisation, different mentality, legal systems, and the like.",

New uses of values in organizing and managing inequalities emerge. Values lead active social life as bourgeois virtues (McCloskey, 2006), their subversive alternatives or translated “memes” of cultural history. Since social life of values went global and online, tracing their hybrid manifestations requires cross-culturally competent domestication (Magala, 2005) as if they were “memes” manipulated for further reengineering. Hopes are linked to emergent concepts of “microstorias” (Boje,2002), bottom-up, participative, open citizenship (Balibar,2004), disruption of stereotypical branding in mass-media (Sennett, 2006). However, Kuhn’s opportunistic deviation from Popperian evolutionary epistemology should fade away with other hidden injuries of Cold War, to free our agenda for the future of social sciences in general and organizational sciences in particular (Fuller, 2000, 2003).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Socioemotional Selectivity Theory poses that as we age our motivations transition from knowledge focused to emotionally focused (Carstensen, 1995). This shift to emotional motivation increases the relevance of relationships and social interactions for older adults. We examined different aspects of social support: frequency of positive/negative social interactions, satisfaction with positive social interactions, and bothered by social interactions -- to investigate these effects on one’s global well-being. Negative and positive social exchanges are linked to psychological health (Newsom et al., 2005), however one’s perceptions of those social interactions are important to consider as well -- being satisfied or bothered by social interactions shows a better perspective of the individual’s experience than simply recording frequency. The results of our multi-group path analysis show that there are different effects of social supports on global well-being contingent on age, consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory. For adults under 30 years old (Mage = 24.0, range 18 to 29) social support did not significantly relate to well-being. For adults over 30 and under 50 (Mage = 38.9) frequency of positive social interactions is significantly related to well-being (B = .201). For adults over 50 (Mage = 58.8, range 50 to 87) the perception of social exchanges, not their frequency, are what influence well-being: both satisfaction with positive social interactions (B = .402) and being bothered by negative social interactions predict well-being (B = -.193). It is important to know that older adult’s perceptions of social exchanges effect their well-being, future directions are discussed.",

      "title": "International Institutions and Emerging Actors in a Globalized World",
      "abstract": "Different dimensions of globalization and environmental regimes The process of globalization includes different phenomena that are often misunderstood and leading to contradictory interpretations. Some authors define it exclusively in economic terms (increasing homogenization an internationalization of consumption and production patterns), in its financial expressions (the magnitude and growing interdependence of capital flows internationally), or also in its commercial aspects (increased external exposure and openness of national economies). Others prefer to emphasize the character of globalization in its political (widespread predominance of liberal democracies and of civil liberties worldwide, as well as new forms of social participation and empowerment) and institutional dimensions (prominence of market forces, increased convergence of regulatory mechanisms and instruments, increased flexibility of labor markets). Still others choose to highlight the speed of technological change (its impacts in the productive apparatus, in labor markets as well as in structures and relations of power) and the impressive revolution experienced by mass media (massification in access, transmission and dissemination of information, greater prospects for decentralization, possible erosion of national cultural identities). However, making use of a somewhat different approach to analyze these clearly multifaceted phenomena--ooking at globalization as a process more than as a group of specific vectors--some still prefer to study these from the viewpoint of international relations and of the emergence of new economic, commercial and political alliances and blocs. Not few, including myself, consider it more revealing to unveil globalization from a sustainable development perspective. These question, for instance, the economic rationality of globalization in its many dimensions vis-a-vis the logic and the pace of natural processes. In other words, capital (flows) may have become yet the same has not taken place with respect to labor or natural resources. Moreover, the prospects of a process of globalization founded upon an upward, unlimited and unchecked economic growth model are also seriously disputed, particularly in view of the reality of exhaustion of many natural resources (e.g., fauna, flora, non-renewable sources of energy) as well as of deterioration of natural processes which are crucial for the ecosystemic viability of life on the planet (ozone layer, climate, etc.). Finally, those of us who subscribe to these and other serious reservations point also to the growing consensus about the social unsustainability of the current style of development, a reality of globalization in the midst of increasing social inequality and exclusion, a reality which certainly precedes but has been exacerbated by the very process of globalization. One may deepen a socio-environmental standpoint by asserting that the character of globalization, or at least of the neoconservative ideology underlying and legitimating the hegemonic modernity of today's world, appear to leave but only two alternatives to emerging countries. Either these integrate themselves fully--albeit subordinated and dependent--in the globalization bandwagon of the world market, or it will not remain nothing more to those countries than the reality of backwardness masked behind the illusion of autonomous development. The position advocated here supposes that the foregoing standpoint in fact begs the real question. At the heart of today's challenges lies, not the inevitable tendency of insertion into a world increasingly globalized, but what mode of insertion is convenient to emerging economies, whether prevailing patterns of insertion allow these countries to retain the national control of growth, and what sort of alternatives allow these societies to maintain and foster social cohesion, cultural identity and environmental integrity. …",

Integration of football into the market economy has been coming through gradational adaptation of basic institutions to necessities of market in place of previous non-market motivations and forms, integration of football into the consumer culture through mass medias (including development of sponsorship), constitution of football as a gainful job and then deregulation of football labour market, change of social status of the best players and upward social mobility of the professional players, transformations of social identities of football fans and in end result creation of the relatively autonomus unequal economic structure both in national and world scale with its imanent financial problems.

But it has not been clear which of these variables show relatively the greatest differences. The Survey of World Views project operated from the premise that such issues are best addressed in a diverse sampling of countries representing a majority of the world’s population, with a very large range of item-content. Data were collected online from 8,883 individuals (almost entirely college students based on local publicizing efforts) in 33 countries that constitute more than two third of the world’s population, using items drawn from measures of nearly 50 variables. This report focuses on the broadest patterns evident in item data. The largest differences were not in those contents most frequently emphasized in cross-cultural psychology (e.g., values, social axioms, cultural tightness), but instead in contents involving religion, regularity-norm behaviors, family roles and living arrangements, and ethnonationalism. Content not often studied cross-culturally (e.g., materialism, Machiavellianism, isms dimensions, moral foundations) demonstrated moderate-magnitude differences. Further studies are needed to refine such conclusions, but indications are that cross-cultural psychology may benefit from casting a wider net in terms of the psychological variables of focus.",

It has been argued that these and other forms of social activism, in which individuals take action in order to serve the common good, play an essential role in combating the problems that face the world (Snyder &amp; Omoto, 2007). Because many of these problems, such as violence, discrimination, and the destruction of the environment, are largely caused by the actions of humans, they may also be problems that require the actions of humans to be ameliorated.",

      "title": "Les petits conflits quotidiens dans les classes de l'enseignement secondaire. I. Nature et sens des transgressions sociales à l'origine des conflits dans la dyade enseignant-élève.",
      "abstract": "Le passage a l'adolescence est une periode de transition durant laquelle de nombreux changements individuels s'operent. Ceux-ci bouleversent l'equilibre psycho-social etabli jusqu'alors et de nouveaux besoins naissent auxquels l'environnement social n'est plus aptes a repondre (Eccles, Midgley, Wigfield, Buchanan, Reuman, Flanagan, et MacIver, 1993). Un ecart se cree entre les attentes des adolescents et ce qu'ils percoivent des offres de l'environnement social. Par definition, ces besoins developpementaux et les attentes qu'ils creent sont naturellement orientes vers plus d'autonomie. Mais ce processus developpemental vers plus d'autonomie se heurte aux contraintes sociales liees aux regles sociales imposees par les figures d'autorite. Selon Collins et Laursen (1995) et Smetana (1989), les conflits sociaux a l'adolescence refleteraient ce heurt entre les besoins developpementaux et les contraintes sociales. Plus encore, les conflits interpersonnels inities par les adolescents rempliraient pleinement une fonction developpementale. D'apres Emery (1995) et Collins et Laursen (1995), ils joueraient directement sur la restructuration des relations dont l'organisation est percue comme obsolete, en vue d'une plus grande compatibilite avec les aspirations actuelles. Ainsi, le declenchement des conflits interpersonnels installe un contexte de debat qui force les relations unilaterales impliquees a fonctionner sur un registre plus mutuel, a partir duquel les adolescents vont pouvoir exprimer leur desir d'autonomie tout en developpant leur competence a prendre la perspective d'autrui. Selon Eccles et al. (1993), la periode de transition developpementale que connaissent les individus a la fin de l'enfance s'accompagne d'une transition scolaire delicate marquee par un changement net d'environnement social. Les auteurs citent plusieurs etudes qui mettent en evidence des elements constitutifs du contexte scolaire en porte-a-faux avec les besoins actuels des adolescents, compte-tenu de leur etat developpemental. Au vu de ces elements, les auteurs concluent a l'inaptitude de l'environnement scolaire ordinaire a repondre aux besoins developpementaux des adolescents. Parmi ces elements, on note, par comparaison avec l'ecole fondamentale, l'augmentation du nombre d'enseignants par classe, qui appauvrit la qualite des relations et les rendent impersonnelles ; le renforcement des mesures de discipline et de controle, etouffant l'expression du desir d'autonomie des adolescents ; et le nombre peu eleve d'occasions donnees aux eleves de participer aux prises de decision les touchant directement. Ces elements et les repercussions qu'ils ont sur le quotidien des eleves pourraient constituer des obstacles a leur developpement social. Toutes ces considerations soulevent la question de l'eventuelle fonction developpementale des conflits quotidiens qui naissent dans la dyade enseignant - eleve au sein des classes de l'enseignement secondaire ordinaire. Ces conflits sont-ils l'expression d'un desequilibre sur le plan structurodeveloppemental et surgissent-ils en vue de reduire l'ecart entre les offres de l'environnement social et les besoins individuels ? Le contexte relationnel de la dyade dans lequel les conflits se deploient permet-il l'accomplissement de cette fonction ? Ces questions ont motive l'elaboration d'un travail de recherche doctorale qui porte sur les modes de resolution de conflits nes de transgressions sociales en classe et qui analyse les variations de ces strategies en fonction d'elements constitutifs du contexte interpersonnel percu. Sans qu'elles soient directement investiguees dans la recherche, les questions qui viennent d'etre posees ont cependant fait l'objet d'une preoccupation sousjacente constante. La recherche est divisee en deux parties. Une premiere phase, exploratoire, decrit et analyse des recits de conflits enseignant-eleve rapportes par ecrit par des eleves de l'enseignement secondaire du reseau libre de la Communaute francaise de Belgique. Une seconde phase, confirmatoire, etudie les modes de resolutions de conflits mis en oeuvre par les personnes impliquees dans des conflits en fonction de deux elements constitutifs du contexte interpersonnel : la perception qu'ont les eleves de la legitimite des comportements de l'autorite represente par les enseignants impliques, et des comportements d'obeissance des eleves concernes d'une part, les caracteristiques de la relation qui lie les personnes impliquees dans les conflits d'autre part. Le travail de these se fonde sur un cadre conceptuel se referant aux approches developpementales du raisonnement et du comportement social (Selman, Beardslee, Shultz, Krupa, et Podorefsky, 1986), et du contexte interpersonnel dans lequel ils se deploient (Hartup et Laursen, 1999 ; Laursen, Wilder, Noack, et Williams, 2000 ; Smetana, 1995/1999). Il s'inscrit dans une approche ecologique du developpement humain, inspiree des propositions de Bronfenbrenner (1981). Trois Cahiers de Recherche sont consacres a la phase exploratoire de la recherche. Le premier Cahier de Recherche (n° 16) analyse les comportements declencheurs de conflits quotidiens dans la dyade enseignant-eleve. Le deuxieme (n° 20) est consacre a l'etude des strategies mises en oeuvre par les enseignants et les eleves pour resoudre ces conflits. Le troisieme et present texte porte sur l'evaluation que les eleves font des comportements mis en oeuvre par les deux parties impliquees pour resoudre ces conflits, en lien avec les notions de legitimite des figures d'autorite a agir et a etre obeies.",

In other words, there are differences between styles considered acceptable in a national culture or another. Looking at different models of and differences between cultural norms, we find that in this increasingly globalized world, begin to crystallize several converging trends. Thus, leadership that leaders who act in a multicultural environment would be useful following attributes and skills: charisma, aptitude for teamwork, openness to change, interest in political and socio-economic life of other countries; ability to retain good relations with people of other cultures, adaptability to new situations, ability to work in a multicultural team, etc. Foundation skills training exceptional global is built from childhood through socialization experiences that influence cultural patterns, and also are influenced by them. Early managerial responsibilities and experience gained in international projects do not create skills for in international environment, but they develop. Consequently, global leaders must create multicultural communities, creating a culture that goes over the differences between people and contains certain guiding signals-values and attitudes - which can be easily understood by employees from different cultural groups. Thus, global development program does not focus exclusively on understanding and acceptance of cultural diversity, but goes further, making the people realize they need a common organizational culture. Globalization requires many changes in the economy, communication, political structures, in all areas of personal and organizational-among them such essential processes of cultural convergence and diversification.",

We expect that someone, born to parents living permanently on the territory of the given country, will be fully adapted and naturally included into the outer community. The general desire to belong to this social community or another postulates the same requirements. However, in many situations, the person’s disposition to be integrated, adapted and socially included does not depend exceptionally on his/her desire, or even efforts to be “a member of a great society”. Sometimes, however, grand societal processes, prejudices and biases may block the necessary integration and social inclusion of people possessing foreigners’ backgrounds, even though they consequently are blocking multiple areas of social, societal, economical and general development of their community.",

      "title": "Conflict in volunteer sporting organisations",
      "abstract": "A number of recent articles have suggested that dealing with conflict within an organisation is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks of management. Conflict disrupts the normal operations of an organisation and can lead to breakdown in relationships between workers. This breakdown can lead to lower performance, commitment, satisfaction, and turnover, which can ultimately influence organisational effectiveness and profits. However, conflict if managed well can also result in creativity, innovation, and an enhanced operating environment, as individuals strive to work together. Robbins (2006) suggests that there are there three types of conflict namely, interpersonal conflict, which arises from personality and value differences; task conflict, that is the result of conflicting task demands for scant resources; and, communication conflict which is the result of poor communication processes. Each type of conflict has the potential to affect an organisation in a variety of ways and therefore require different management strategies. Voluntary sporting organisations (VSO) are not exempt from the prevalence of conflict. Auld (1994), for example, remarked that as sporting organisations become more professionalised volunteers become unable to distinguish their role, where they have expertise and are uncertain about the division of responsibilities. Schulz (2006) explored these ideas in more detail. His research revealed that volunteers and paid staff within VSOs often have different views on the function and management of the organisation. Similarly, Amis, Slack, and Berrett (1995) suggested that VSOs, “…exhibit characteristics that render them significantly more susceptible to conflict than other organisations (p.1)”. They argued that the low level of formalisation and lack of resources directly contribute to conflict. Verhoeven et al (1999) had similar findings in their study of Flemish VSOs. The aim of the present study was to provide a preliminary exploration of conflict within VSOs in the United Kingdom and in particular examine the relationship between the various types of conflict and key organisational behavioural variables such as commitment and satisfaction.",

The needs of a society are not “given,” therefore, but are functions of an already developed culture, and for this reason they cannot be thought of as constants variably filled with diverse cultural content.

      "title": "Sociological Analysis of Mass Media Role in Promotion of Mob Violence (A Case Study of Two Selected Cities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)",
      "abstract": "IntroductionViolence is a hot media issue now a day. The wider spread of mass media in our societal surrounding brought many changes to our environment such as the radio set, TV, shows, videos, video games, and social networking gaining an influencing role in our society. In one way or the other, the mass media is having a significant influence on our values, attitudes, and outlooks (Puddephatt, 2006). Many theorists have reported association of the mass media with Violence generally secured by standard news media incorporates socially endorsed brutality (composed prizefighting, police movements) or brutality between and around social orders (Meadow, 2009). The impacts of one particular factor of the mass communication disclosure has predominantly unfavorable effects on viewers' and others' well-being (Puddephatt, 2006).Meadow (2009) argues about numerous types of violence that are found in our society such as domestic violence, criminal acts and daily interpersonal conflicts. Most of violent acts happen in private, with no media coverage as these acts are eccentric, undetectable, irregular, or not subject to crowds. Media mostly report those incidents of violence which are open to access such as acts of terrorism, political violence and violence in urban areas. Mob violence is a very common phenomena today especially in underdeveloped world. According to oxford dictionary (2013), mob mean, large crowd of people, especially one that is disorderly arranged and intent on causing trouble or violence. Mob behaviour can be defined as the unique behavioural characteristic in which people act differently in a large group than they usually would as an individual or in a smaller group (Barnkart, 2008). Mob violence is A disturbance of the peace by several persons, assembled and acting with a common aim in executing a lawful or unlawful enterprise in a violent and turbulent manner. The accurate quantification of human losses due to violence is impossible (Puddephatt, 2006). Mob violence is a crime against the communal harmony and stability, rather than an abuse of the privileges and rights of a particular person.Mass media has an influence upon behaviour of the people. Norman (2010) elucidated that media violence is visual depictions of actions of physical violence by one human being against another. This meaning of media violence does not incorporate off-screen poisonings that could be intimated, but instead it alludes to outwardly depicted physically combative acts by one individual against an alternate. Movies and programs on television depicting ferocity of this type were common during the last decade of the 20th century, and they are common now: Dirty Harry, Mad Max, Cliffhanger, True Lies, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc. with an unending list. Few measures also damage society's insight and public demonstrates for their rights. Mass media due to its few programs creates violence in the people. Violent behaviour denotes an action planned to harm or aggravate another individual. Such actions could be material or nonmaterial. This contains several types of acts that do not appear to shape the generally agreed sense of Norman (2010) said that hurling insults and dispersing injurious rumours fit the classification. Obviously, the violent behaviours of utmost unease to society obviously involve material antagonism (Strasburger, 2009). The Guardian (2010) reported that Western businesses burn in Pakistan riots.Numerous studies have been conducted on media and violence but very limited literature is available on the role of media in the promotion and prevention of In order to contribute towards filling existing gaps in literature on media role in violence, this study attempt to measure the association between mass media related factors with violence in cities.Review of LiteratureToday in every part of the world mass media plays a major role in the promotion of …",

They have advocated for, designed, and implemented an array of domestic and international social policies and have increasingly campaigned for and held political office. Even so, there has been considerable ambivalence within the profession about the extent to which social workers should engage in political action, considered by some to be “radical” social work. A major challenge facing the profession during the 21st century is to ensure that social work programs and associations prepare students and practitioners to understand the impact of political processes on their and their clients’ lives and to develop the skills to identify the forms of political intervention that are effective for different goals and different political, social, and economic contexts.",

Community stakeholders may include familial descendants, local residents, civic officials, nonprofit organizations, tribal representatives, government agencies, commercial developers, business owners, the media, students, professionals from other fields (e.g., historic preservationists, architects, environmental scientists), and any other individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the sites that archaeologists investigate and interpret. Collaborative partnerships between archaeologists and communities take many forms, from one-time consultations to long-term initiatives that involve stakeholders in all aspects of project design, data recovery, and outcomes. In the early 21st century, collaborative archaeology projects have become increasingly oriented toward political action, ethical practice, restorative justice, community welfare, and engaging social issues that extend beyond the traditional disciplinary scope of archaeology. The sheer variety of community-involved archaeology projects and their culturally specific variations across the world are impossible to convey in a single summary. Therefore, this discussion focuses on the politically engaged and action-oriented perspectives of community archaeology projects and their processes, drawing primarily from North American examples.",

This is not the case in the social and health sectors where numbers of groupings called themselves networks, suggesting a certain level of interactions, lots of independence, even a will to escape a more restrictive outline-law (foundation, association, federation). However that might be, the concept seems to embrace several dimensions: actors, structures and types of interactions. We would like to bring here a few thoughts aiming to reach a more precise definition, and in particular to formulate some conditions in order to enable the distinction between network and others types of functional structures.",

Settlement and integration have economic, social, political, and cultural components, in addition to an interactional, residual core which is not reducible to any component. In the Canadian context, settlement and integration can be operationalized both in formal terms such as the acquisition of permanent residence and citizenship, and in substantive terms such as language acquisition, education and training, employment and self-employment, civic and political participation, sense of belonging, and social inclusion in general. Covering this range of topics coupled with the activities of public (government and civic) institutions to support newcomers in all their diversity can indeed be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;",

Though numerous, these studies are predominantly descriptive, mainly concerned with injury risk distribution across socio-economic groups (measured in terms of social class, education, income, occupation or ethnicity) or with persons in various socio-economic circumstances (e.g., the unemployed, single parents, multi-child families). There is a great need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social patterning of injury risks. Injury research still lacks explanatory models for and empirical evidence on how contextual and individual factors interact in injury causation. Such research may be of considerable help in understanding social differentials in injury risks and, perhaps most importantly, the differential benefits of preventive strategies.",

      "abstract": "This talk deals with “multimodality” as comprising a rich array of verbal and embodied resources that are situatedly mobilized by the participants for the organization of meaningful and publicly recognizable actions within social interaction.\r\nFocusing on face-to-face co-present interactions, documented by video recordings of naturally occurring activities in their ordinary settings, the basic starting point of the talk is the observation that participants do not only speak together, but also gesticulate and move their bodies in meaningful and coordinated ways. Gesture studies have shown that gesture in conversation originate by the same process that produces words (Kendon, 1980; McNeill, 1985). Made predominantly by speakers, but strongly oriented to their partners (Schegloff, 1984), gesture are finely synchronized with the emerging structure of talk (Kendon, 2004) and finely coordinated with the conduct of others (Goodwin, 1981). If gesture, gaze, and\r\nfacial expressions have been studied within a rich interdisciplinary tradition, contemporary studies in social interaction have shown the relevance of other embodied resources (see Streeck, Goodwin, LeBaron, 2011), such as body postures (Schegloff, 1998), embodied manipulations of objects (Goodwin, 2007), bodily arrangements within space (Mondada, 2009) and body movements (Haddington, Mondada, Nevile, in press).\r\nThe talk develops this enlarged vision of multimodality, and focuses on how a range of resources (gesture, gaze, body posture, body movements, walking, and embodied\r\nmanipulations of artefacts) are mobilized in a concerted way within the finely tuned and methodic coordination of action between the participants. More particularly, the talk\r\nfocuses on the temporal organization of these resources – their synchronicity, simultaneity, mutual adjustments, and sequentiality – showing how they are collectively mobilized,\r\nbuilding complex emergent multimodal Gestalts. The talk also focuses on the situated way in which these multimodal resources are selected and adjusted to the specificities of the ecology of action.\r\nIn this sense, the talk discusses the very notion of ‘resource’ for the organization of social interaction and the way in which multimodal resources are made locally relevant and are intersubjectively oriented to by the participants building in real time the accountability of\r\ntheir actions.",

      "title": "Sustainable community movement organisations",
      "abstract": "In the current economic crisis, social movements are simultaneously facing two types of challenges: first, they are confronting institutions which are less able (or willing) to mediate new demands for social justice and equity emerging from various sectors of society, and second, given the highly individualised structure of contemporary society, they are also experiencing difficulties in building bonds of solidarity and cooperation among people, bonds which are a fundamental resource for collective action. It is in this context that protests waves, which may be very relevant, are in fact often short-lived, and it is in this context that we detect the rise and consolidation of new mutualistic and cooperative experiences within which (similarly to the past) new ties and frames for collective action are created. This article discusses and analyses social movement organisations which focus on both the intensification of economic problems and the difficulties of rebuilding social bonds and solidarity within society, emphasising solidarity and the use of ‘alternative’ forms of consumption as means to re-embed the economic system within social relations, starting from the local level. While discussing what is new and/or what has been renewed in new Sustainable Community Movement Organisations, the article will develop an analytical framework which will combine social movements and political consumerism theories by focusing on two basic dimensions: consumer culture and identity and organisational resources and repertoire of action.",

Community treatment programs have fared little better because they also entail client stigmatization and typically are conducted within the context of deviant peer groups. Consequently, in order to enhance the rehabilitative potential of community treatment, subsequent efforts should be conducted within \"traditional\" agencies and within pro-social peer groups. The emphasis upon \"pro-social\" rehabilitation environments does not posit any particular assets and/or liabilities of a given socio-economic stratum, thus avoiding a major deficiency of many sociological theories of juvenile delinquency, viz., the tendency to derive particularized etiological and interventive principles from a generalized variable, that is, social class. Instead, our basic assumption is that both anti-social and pro-social environments are to be found within any social stratum, and that the latter ought to constitute the preferred loci for rehabilitative endeavors.",

The purpose of these ICTs is to bring together parties who are separated by those factors and allow them to collaborate and communicate for the purposes of their work without actually feeling the effect of time and distance. These tools have particular use for virtual organisations that operate in environments that are undefined physically in terms of space and time, yet allow information and knowledge to flow freely, therefore bridging the gap that is experienced by space, distance, and time. In traditional methods of face-to-face work, people are able to see and feel one another, factors that although may not seem so obviously important to begin with, are actually essential to cooperation and collaboration, because it is based on these physical cues that people begin to form the basic impressions and opinions upon which they base their trust of one another (Kreijns, Kirschner, & Jochems, 2003). Within the context of virtual work, particularly where people have never met, the basis for initial trust is missing and it seems that the success of working in virtual environments, or lack thereof, is fundamentally due to this.

If we want to build artificial systems that can help us to create music – or, even more, that can attempt to create music on their own – we should strive to include the social element in those systems. The artificial intelligence approach to musical creativity has often been a solitary affair, constructing lone monolithic systems that come up with music by themselves (Loy, 1989). Instead, can we build a more socially motivated group of interacting artificial agents, who then create music within their social context? The answer is yes – but to do so, we need to move away from the standard conception of artificial intelligence, and enter the new world of artificial life.",

      "title": "UBLIC THEATRE’S SOCIAL ROLE AND ITS AUDIENCE",
      "abstract": "Today, public theatre is directed toward adapting to its contemporary socio-economic context. In doing this, it is trying to preserve its artistic values and at the same time fulfill and diversify its social functions and missions. When we talk about public theatre’s social function, i.e. the public value it produces, some of the main issues concern its contribution to the most pressing social matters. In general, these issues concern public theatre’s role in strengthening social cohesion, cultural emancipation and social inclusion, its role in the process of opening dialogues, revising formal history and re-examining traditional forms of thinking. Fulfilment of these functions is strongly linked with the character of public theatre’s audiences. In more practical terms, the scope of public theatre’s social influence is dependent on how homogenous its audiences are. If one considers artistic organizations’ need for sustainability as a key factor in their need for constantly widening their audience, and particularly the inclusion of “others” (those not belonging to the dominant cultural group), in the context of contemporary society’s need for social and cultural inclusion, then the task of today’s public theatres becomes rather difficult. Simply said, there are too many needs to be met at the same time. The main questions this paper is asking is: to what extent do Belgrade’s public theatres understand the importance of diversifying its audiences, and how do they perceive their social role? Starting from the fact that human capital is the primary resource and success factor of any theatre organization, we explore in what manner management and employees in these theatres address these issues, i.e. how they redefine theatre’s social role and attract audiences that do not fit the dominant theatre audience model.",

Economic development is influenced by many factors. Some of these are statistically discoverable and quantifiable, while others, which fall within the sphere of social relations and their identification, are more difficult to measure and interpret. Czech rural areas face many problems which arise from their specific features – socio-demographic structure, job possibility of various social groups, provision of the proper level of public services, transport accessibility, etc. However, there is no direct connection between economic factors and mutual relations within the rural community. Values, opinions and the behavioural patterns of people are immediately displayed in a locality, but their character is shaped by the regional and national assumptions of every stage of development. Contributions are drawn from the accessible literature and secondary data of empirical research projects.",

Una mirada rápida sobre la cuestión descartaría el uso de esta figura como una estrategia para generar agencia, puesto la víctima se caracteriza por su pasividad. Sin embargo, el caso es que su utilización en el espacio público habilita ciertas prerrogativas en el agente que la invoca, al mismo tiempo que lo coloca en una posición que no necesariamente se caracteriza por su pasividad sino que, al contrario, la figura dota al agente de posibilidades de acción muy específicas. En particular, en este trabajo nos proponemos poner en discusión este punto de vista considerando algunos ejemplos de negacionismo en torno al carácter de la víctima en cuanto tal. La negación de la víctima a partir de la disputa de su posición por parte de sus victimarios nos pone sobre aviso de un tipo de intervención verbal que tiene como ámbito de discusión a la figura de marras.&#x0D; En este trabajo proponemos, por una parte, historizar esta figura a partir del trazado de su genealogía, utilizando como insumos teóricos los estudios de Rene Girard y, por la otra, analizar retóricamente algunos casos ejemplares en los que se hace visible el tipo de agencia que caracteriza su uso.

      "title": "Understanding Human Behavior Response to Disasters",
      "abstract": "Human behavior during disasters is shaped by a complex interplay of psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors. Understanding these elements is critical to improving disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. Psychological factors, such as risk perception, significantly influence how individuals prepare for and respond to disasters. Personal experiences, media coverage, and cognitive biases shape risk assessments and decision-making processes. Theories such as protection motivation theory and the extended parallel process model offer insights into how individuals make decisions about disaster preparedness. Coping mechanisms during disasters can be problem focused, addressing the root causes of stress, or emotion focused, managing the emotional impact through strategies such as seeking social support. Social and cultural dimensions also play crucial roles in disaster resilience. Social networks and community cohesion provide essential support systems that facilitate recovery. Cultural beliefs, including religious and spiritual practices, offer comfort and explanations during disasters, while traditional knowledge contributes to preparedness and response efforts. However, social vulnerability is heightened among certain groups, such as lower income individuals, the elderly, and those with disabilities. Gender roles further influence disaster experiences and responses, often dictating the resources and support available to individuals. Economic factors are equally significant in shaping disaster outcomes. Access to financial resources and insurance can determine the extent of disaster preparedness and recovery. Economic inequality exacerbates the impact of disasters, with marginalized groups frequently experiencing the most severe consequences. Targeted interventions and support for these vulnerable populations are essential for reducing disparities and promoting equitable recovery. Case studies, such as those on Hurricane Katrina, the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, and the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrate the diverse psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors that influence disaster responses and recovery efforts. Integrating these behavioral insights into disaster management strategies is vital for motivating protective behaviors, ensuring culturally sensitive interventions, and providing comprehensive mental health support. Building resilient communities requires a multifaceted approach that includes community-based strategies, economic policies addressing vulnerabilities, and resilient infrastructure design. These efforts are crucial for enhancing community resilience and minimizing the impacts of future disasters.",

      "abstract": "Social dialogue instruments serve to ease social conflicts and create economic benefits in the critical situation in the country. Social dialogue is a means to pursue problem solving through dialogue, while achieving goals such as social justice, economic efficiency and democratic participation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) and the European Union (EU) actively encourage social dialogue organizations through agreements and recommendations because social dialogue organizations are desirable in solving economic and social crises, and that is why advanced countries in Europe are spreading social dialogue organizations to the third world. In this sense, social dialogue can be evaluated as positive system contributing to social development, given that social partners, in times of crisis in the nation and society, seek and present reasonable solutions through dialogue. But, as in the case of Korea, if representatives of social dialogue are biased in pursuing only certain interests, it may not help overcome social crises. In particular, critics say that the union’s demand that represents the interests of a small number of full-time workers could lead to unfair consequences for non-regular workers and backfire rather than achieving a fair society originally intended. In this sense, social dialogue system is undemocratic and undesirable. That is why there is widespread distrust in labor-management negotiations and no trust in the tripartite consultative body in Korea. The cases of Denmark and the Netherlands, which have a deep history of social dialogue instruments, offer practical help in understanding the function of dialogue instruments and analyzing their success or failure. In Denmark’s case, the state does not intervene in labor-management relations if possible, labor-related laws are minimal and the parties of the social dialogue body set wage and other working conditions autonomously, the mutual respect and trust between the parties is very strong, and there is little act of dispute, and that the parties of the social dialogue are drawn to benefit everyone by exercising the spirit of compromise and concession. The spirit of the Dutch folder model, which has cooperated with each other to prevent the collapse of the banks even if there is social conflict to protect land below sea level, achieved “Dutch miracle” through a grand compromise between labor and management when the nation faced an economic crisis in the early 1980s. Thus the Dutch labor and management somehow do their best to strengthen national interest and national competitiveness by avoiding confrontation and conflict. Nevertheless, we cannot help but notice the fact that social dialogue systems in Denmark and the Netherlands, which were called the epitome of cooperative dialogue instruments, are also facing a crisis due to the rapid development of technology, digitalization and changes in employment forms. It can be said that social dialogue institutions in all European countries, as well as Denmark and the Netherlands, are facing challenges from rapidly changing socioeconomic realities. This is because the fundamental question arises whether the social dialogue body, which based on traditional subordinate labor, can represent the rapidly rising new form of labor, along with the mega trend of the fourth industrial revolution. Many of the problems facing the world can also be said to be the great task that social dialogue organizations must continue to address; in particular, problems stemming from the polarization of income and rapidly changing environment, the rise of low-income workers, fundamental changes in labor and employment relationships(especially changes and automation caused by technological innovation and digitalization), an increase in informal labor (change due to technological development and low birthrates), an increase in migrant workers and refugees, and an insufficient social safety net. In order to overcome these crises, social dialogue agenda must include not only the present but also the future transformation. Labor and management parties must also consider socioeconomic environment, political stability, their own competitiveness and the development of a sustainable society rather than sticking to the interests of their own groups alone. After all, for social dialogue to function properly, they must quickly adapt to changes in society beyond collective selfishness and transform themselves into “living instruments” that contribute to the welfare and national interests of the absolute majority.",

      "title": "Young people and anti- social behaviour",
      "abstract": "The language of anti-social behaviour has strong relationships to developments in the United Kingdom although its theoretical and empirical roots are from the United States of America (Millie et al. 2005). Within other western and developed nations the concept of anti-social behaviour is not a common part of academic or political language. For example, we do not see it discussed in public or policy debates in any substantial manner in the European Union, Australia or even the USA. This being said concerns about behaviour, which is now being seen in the UK context as anti-social, such as, 'incivilities' and 'minor' forms of misbehaviour within community settings, has a long history in US criminology and has recently infiltrated policy developments in some European nations (Burney 2005). The policy concept of anti-social behaviour though, is fundamentally a British phenomenon and a concept used to explain and define certain types of behaviour as criminal or deviant. There is also much uncertainty about what it means and how it can be defined (and measured) and much discussion over how antisocial behaviour is constructed around 'commonsense' understandings. For example, the UK government has continually claimed that we all understand what it is, even though a definition is hard to find. It tends therefore to be assumed that there is a consensus over its meaning, while in reality no such agreement exists (Millie et al. 2005). It is also worth acknowledging that anti-social behaviour is not necessarily defined as just a 'youthful activity'. In fact, its history is linked more to criminological debates on neighbourhood decline in the USA. This tends to see youth criminal behaviour as only one of many indicators of social decline. But in the UK context anti-social behaviour has, over the past ten years, been more synonymous with problematic youthful activity in local neighbourhoods. It has also been used by both the media and government as a way of focusing attention on young people's relationships, not only with their communities but also as a symbol of a decline in 'respect' and an indicator of their lack of interest in making a positive contribution to society (France 2007).",

      "abstract": "Maatschappelijke vraagstukken zijn vaak clusters van sociaalmaatschappelijke, economische en ruimtelijke problemen. Zulke clusters van problemen vragen om een integrale aanpak. Want een probleem aanpakken vanuit een enkele discipline leidt vaak tot nieuwe problemen in een ander domein. Maar hoe doe je dat? Hoe realiseer je een integrale aanpak? Een van de peilers bij het werken aan zulke vraagstukken is grensoverschrijdend samenwerken. Grensoverschrijdend samenwerken betekent: samenwerken voorbij de grenzen van onze routines, ons vakgebied en onze organisatie. Maar grensoverschrijdend samenwerken betekent ook: samenwerken voorbij onze opvattingen, beelden en aannames die we hebben over wat het vraagstuk is, hoe we het vraagstuk moeten aanpakken en wat de oplossingsrichting is. Al die aspecten van samenwerken zijn noodzakelijk om beweging te krijgen in vraagstukken waarop we het antwoord niet weten. Tegelijkertijd is samenwerken ook vaak de belemmering om tot vernieuwing te komen. Dit artikel gaat in op de noodzaak en lastigheid van samenwerken aan grote maatschappelijke vernieuwingen, ook wel systeeminnovaties genoemd.",

      "abstract": "COMMUNITY AND ADJUSTMENT are common terms rarely meaningfully defined. Yet they are of such obvious importance that such questions as the following are frequently posed: What are the community factors in personal adjustment? Does the community provide for various kinds of adjustment? Such questions oblige us to formulate a usable definition of community; namely, a social organization which provides for a large part of the biological, psychological, and social needs of a group of people. Research in this area seems to spread itself along a continuum proceeding from studies of kinds of adjustment and their correlation with community factors, thru studies of the resources the community affords for the various kinds of adjustment (or maladjustment), to studies of the community and its effect on the kind of adjustment possible.",

      "abstract": "The article examines the concept of \"social inclusion\" as a process which ensures gain the opportunities to participate fully in economic, social, political and cultural life. The problems of such social inclusive groups as persons with disabilities, persons released from places of deprivation of liberty, participants of ATO/UFO, women in difficult circumstances, homeless persons, elderly persons, children and youth, residents of rural areas are systematized in the following areas: economic, socio-psychological, professional, legal, medical. It was shown that the main economic problems for the majority of inclusive groups are low income, difficulties with employment. The consequence is crime, health problems, various forms of addiction, lack of communication and social adaptation. The concept of \"creative industries\" as sectors whose activities are based on cultural values, or other artistic individual or collective creative expressions is considered. The possibilities of creative business areas (advertising, architecture, crafts, design, fashion, video, film and photography, games, music, publishing and printing activities, computers, research and development) to solve the problem of social exclusion are analyzed. It was revealed that for involvement in most types of economic activity, a qualification at the level of upper secondary education, post-secondary non-tertiary education is sufficient. As a result, a significant number of socially inclusive groups can be included in the production of economic and public goods. Based on the study of the most common social business models, it was shown that a partial solution to the problems of social inclusive groups, such as low incomes and employment problems, is possible on the basis of creative industries using such common social business models as employment model, fee-for-service model, service subsidy model, cooperative model, low-income client as market model, organizational support model. At the same time, the financial self-sufficiency of enterprises is ensured mainly due to income from the sale of products and services.",

Second, are they subject to norms and values, and do they take part in the social construction of the same? After answering these questions partially in the affirmative, I examine the requirements that must be met before robots can be perceived as fully in social institutions. If these requirements are met, I argue that social robots can indeed be in social institutions conducive to meeting fundamental needs and sustaining viable societal structures. Finally, I argue that meeting the most important requirements rely on design choices that can potentially be made with existing technologies. Meeting the requirements would potentially allow social robots a different social standing, but designers and regulators also have good reasons not to design—or allow robots to be designed—in such ways.",

They may be especially susceptible to victimization because of age-related changes in both episodic memory and social motivation. Here we examined these factors in a context where adaptive social decision-making requires intact associative memory for previous social interactions. Older adults made more maladaptive episodic memory-guided social decisions, but not only because of poorer associative memory. Older adults were biased toward remembering people as being fair, while young adults were biased toward remembering people as being unfair. Holding memory constant, older adults engaged more with people that were familiar (regardless of the nature of the previous interaction), whereas young adults were prone to avoiding others that they remembered as being unfair. Finally, older adults were more influenced by facial appearances, choosing to interact with social partners that looked more generous, even though those perceptions were inconsistent with prior experience.",

      "abstract": "Ideas and people may be mobilized in order to influence the thinking of policy makers or society to either promote a specific point of view or enact policy in the form of laws or programs that benefit the ideas or people. This mobilization of ideas and people is known as political advocacy, which falls into two broad categories: social action and social mobilization, which can—but not necessarily—give rise to social movements, and interest and lobbying groups. According to Mancur Olson, groups are organized to pursue a common good or benefit. The success or failure of such groups can be explained using models such as the classical model, the resource mobilization model, and the “political process” model. The success of political advocacy is contingent upon a number of interrelated concepts and characteristics, including access to resources (money, people, and time), good leadership, a sense of identity or common focus, and the opportunity to be heard. A movement can distribute its message to its target audience—for example, policy makers, opinion leaders, potential participants, or the public at large—by means of information and communications technologies (ICTs). Two theses are used to assess the effectiveness of ICTs in political advocacy: the mobilization thesis and the reinforcement thesis. The inclusion of international communication has enriched our understanding of how, when, where, and why political advocacy is or is not effective.",

      "abstract": "Each of us makes a number of decisions, from the less important to those with far-reaching consequences. As members of different groups, we are also actors of group decision making. In order to make a rational decision, a choice-making procedure must satisfy a number of assumptions (conditions) of rationality. In addition, when it comes to group decisions, those procedures should also be ?fair.? However, it is not possible to define a procedure of choice-making that would transform individual orders of alternatives based on preferences of perfectly rational individuals into a single social order and still meet conditions of rationality and ethics. The theory of deliberative democracy appeared in response to the impossibility of Social Choice theory. The basic assumption of deliberative democracy is that individuals adjust their preferences taking into account interests of the community. They are open for discussion with other group members and are willing to change their attitudes in order to achieve common interests. Ideally, group members come to an agreement during public discussion (deliberation). Still, this concept cannot completely over?come all the difficulties posed by the theory of social choice. Specifically, there is no solution for strategic and manipulative behavior of individuals. Also, the concept of deliberative democracy faces certain problems particular to this approach, such as, to name but a few, problems with the establishment of equality of participants in the debate and their motivation, as well as problems with the organization of public hearings.",

Pourtant, le probleme est encore trop souvent reduit a un inventaire des « acces » ou des « non acces » par rapport aux pays, regions, groupes sociaux les plus avantages en equipement, traduit en pourcentages, chiffres absolus, courbes de progression ou rosaces comparatives. Cette facon de voir occulte de nombreux aspects de la question. « Avoir acces » ne dit encore rien des usages reels et de la maitrise des individus ou groupes concernes, voire des sentiments d'inclusion ou d'exclusion concretement vecus. Surtout, la situation n'est jamais acquise et la mise sur le marche de nouvelles ressources materielles et logicielles se fait a un rythme et selon des modalites conceptuelles qui rendent toute demarche d'integration automatiquement precaire. Elle peut toucher des personnes du Nord et tout a fait formees dans le domaine des technologies d'information et de communication (TIC, ci-apres). Elle peut toucher aussi, naturellement, des populations d'usagers moins bien positionnees. Ceux qui n'ont pas d'acces semblent sur ce plan echapper a ce probleme. Mais ce n'est qu'un leurre dans la mesure ou toute frequentation du monde des TIC, meme tangentielle, est incontournablement marquee par cette dimension dynamique de la fracture numerique. On pourrait croire qu'il faut d'abord penser a remedier aux deficits statiques avant de penser a cette perte continuelle de substance. En fait, c'est tres dangereux de voir les choses ainsi, car toutes nos observations montrent que le probleme se pose d'emblee, constamment et en evolution parallele avec les aspects d'acces ou de non acces. La fracture dynamique a de multiples visages et n'est que tres rarement prise en compte par des formations ou des activites d'aide ou de cooperation. Nous pensons que le probleme doit etre mieux documente et pris en charge en concomitance avec les problemes d'accessibilite et donc d'infrastructure et de savoir. Nous nous basons, pour l’etude de ce probleme, sur une recherche specifique, en cours d’execution, sur les differentes dimensions de la fracture digitale; mais nous l’avions, bien que sur mode parfois incident, deja identifie dans differentes recherches anterieures.",

The turn of the twentieth century's enthusiasm for normalcy – and for standardization (Adams 1934) – could not bypass the childhood collective for it was in the process of becoming a distinct entity within the national population; public authorities expressed concerns about all but few children's general condition. Developmental standards, which are produced at once and the same time by the activity of and by the technologies of regulation, bring about three different forms of normalcy.",

      "title": "Greater than the sum of its parts: The role of minority and majority\n  status in collaborative problem-solving communication",
      "abstract": "Collaborative problem-solving (CPS) is a vital skill used both in the workplace and in educational environments. CPS is useful in tackling increasingly complex global, economic, and political issues and is considered a central 21st century skill. The increasingly connected global community presents a fruitful opportunity for creative and collaborative problem-solving interactions and solutions that involve diverse perspectives. Unfortunately, women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) often face obstacles during collaborative interactions that hinder their key participation in these problem-solving conversations. Here, we explored the communication patterns of minority and non-minority individuals working together in a CPS task. Group Communication Analysis (GCA), a temporally-sensitive computational linguistic tool, was used to examine how URM status impacts individuals' sociocognitive linguistic patterns. Results show differences across racial/ethnic groups in key sociocognitive features that indicate fruitful collaborative interactions. We also investigated how the groups' racial/ethnic composition impacts both individual and group communication patterns. In general, individuals in more demographically diverse groups displayed more productive communication behaviors than individuals who were in majority-dominated groups. We discuss the implications of individual and group diversity on communication patterns that emerge during CPS and how these patterns can impact collaborative outcomes.",

      "title": "The rhetoric of therapy and the politics of anger: From the safe house to a praxis of shelter",
      "abstract": "Although there has been much discussion in composition studies for the past several years about the importance of contact zones, dissensus, and conflict to the process of learning (Bizzell; Harris; Jarratt; Lu; Olson; Trimbur; West), there has been less talk of the relationship between safe houses and conflict, as well as the role anger plays in social and political engagement. Some composition scholars have argued that in order to help prepare students for participation in civic culture, it is necessary to articulate radical pedagogies, ones that encourage modes of argumentation and that see the tensions of social difference as points of political friction to be interrogated. In arguing for the necessity of agonistic pedagogical models, however, it is easy to overlook not only the affective relations of social and political engagement but also the fact that conflict and dissensus-precisely because of emotional ties and affective investments--o not always follow the proscriptions of reasoned or civil discourse, that engagement cannot always be understood in terms of prevailing rationalities and intelligibilities. In arguing for the importance of conflict (that ideological positions are forged and tested through argumentation rooted in social difference), it is also easy to ignore that sometimes we need to deal with some of the more damaging and long-lasting results of engagement: the effects of pain, violence, cruelty-psychic and emotional injury as well as physical",

Befragt wurden 2523 Personen im Alter von 16 bis 42 Jahren aus vier Bundeslandern: Baden-Wurttemberg, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Aufbauend auf der Lebensspannentheorie der Kontrolle von Heckhausen und Schulz wurde ein Verfahren entwickelt, dass speziell den Umgang mit wandelbezogenen Anforderungen erfassen soll. Es zeigte sich, dass die Personen mit wandelbezogenen Anforderungen in den Bereichen Arbeit, Familie und Freizeit/offentliches Leben uberwiegend ahnlich umgehen, also dass jene Befragten, die sich in einem Bereich aktiv-zupackend verhalten, auch in den anderen Bereichen vergleichbar auf wandelbezogene Anforderungen reagieren. Insgesamt war der aktiv-zupackende Umgang mit sozialem Wandel starker ausgepragt als der problemdistanzierende Umgang, wie aufzugeben und entlastende Interpretationen fur den Misserfolg zu suchen.",

La estructura social podría modificarse rápidamente por las presiones ambientales, por lo que serían necesarios nuevos repertorios conductuales en consonancia con el cambio y al mismo tiempo que éste.Al menos en niveles tan altos de la escala evolutiva, los individuos son capaces de organizar sus conductas según su posición respecto al conjunto del grupo y adecuarlas para acceder a los distintos nichos sociales.

The publics so dear to democratic practice so often appear only metonymically in rules that govern speech.

To attend to actual circuits of participation, one needs to account for the practical capacities that allow bodies to gather in public and move toward desirable ends. The imbrication of state and daily life in Cuba makes study of the affinities between formal and informal political domains particularly robust. Contemporary Cuban dance in a variety of venues—proscenium stages, streets, clubs, and houses—is used to grasp how pleasure meets critique where a social economy for corporeal mobilization is in evidence.",

      "abstract": "In the modern global world, digital technologies are becoming more and more necessary and a mandatorycondition for successful personal and professional realization. We live in a world where digital change and the entryof new technologies into various social spheres have a significant impact on the way each one of us works, buys,communicates and communicates. A number of analyzes are available in the specialized literature, which take intoaccount the fact that through the ongoing digital change, an evolutionary change is taking place in society withsignificant socio-economic consequences, which bring risks and opportunities for profound changes in the socialstructure of society. In order to prevent polarization in society, action is needed to benefit vulnerable individuals andsocial groups. One such action is related to the achievement of equality of opportunity.Thus, not full equality is achieved, but \"achieved inequality\" (Parsons 2005) which replaces \"assigned inequality\" asa result of belonging to a certain class, ethnicity or gender by birth. If we have to paraphrase Ralph Dahrendorf'sthesis (RalfDahrendorf 1979), for the digital transition to happen, new technologies must increase the opportunitiesand improve the life chances of the different social groups in society. A research question of great practicalimportance is how new technologies, instead of deepening existing socio-economic inequalities, can create newopportunities for everyone, including vulnerable groups at risk, against whom statistical data show a lag in the use ofthe Internet for professional and personal fulfillment. The recovery and digital transition must be fair and include thedifferent social groups in society. Insufficiently researched in Bulgaria is what are the opportunities and risks thatdigital technologies hide for the representatives of the different ethnic communities.The present report follows the theoretical tradition of the multidimensional stratification approach, founded by MaxWeber, to determine divisions and positions in the social structure of society. On the basis of a series of in-depthinterviews conducted among representatives of the Roma community within the framework of a project on the topic:\"Digital divide and social inequalities: levels, actors and interactions\", funded by FNI at the Ministry of Educationand Science, an attempt will be made to answer the research question.",

À chaque fois cependant, la mixité sociale apparaît plus comme le résultat d’un bricolage où interviennent plusieurs acteurs autour de l’enjeu du logement social que comme une politique top down. Elle est aussi davantage associée aux statuts d’occupation (propriété, location) qu’à des préoccupations de cohésion sociale. Les hlm , les coopératives et le logement abordable y jouent un rôle-clé.

En revanche, ils s'y associent toujours davantage en creant une situation inedite, tant sur le plan des contenus vehicules que des circulations des flux et de leur controle. Plus important - a moyen terme pensait-on jusqu'alors mais les evenements actuels nous indiquent que les echeances ne sont peut-etre pas si lointaines... - apparaissent desormais les consequences sociales et politiques de l'utilisation massive par les jeunes classes arabes des TIC. Ces technologies favorisent en effet, en particulier dans la sphere des relations a l'Autre et a l'autorite politique, religieuse, familiale, des attitudes, des representations, des pratiques toujours plus autonomes et individualisees qui rendent a l'evidence aujourd'hui impossible ou presque le maintien des anciennes formes de legitimite.

      "title": "Housing Cost Affordability in social housing interventions: analysis of the operating variables impact on the housing costs of a temporary dwelling in Turin",
      "abstract": "Even though if social housing is characterised by the wide diversity of national housing situations, conceptions and policies across member states it is possible recognize a relative convergence in the defining elements of social housing across European Union (EU) member states, namely: i) the existence of specific missions of general interest; ii) the objective to increase supply of affordable housing through the construction, management, purchase, and letting of social housing; and iii) the definition of target groups (either in socio-economic terms or in relation to other types of vulnerability) (Czischke and Pittini, 2007). Moreover it is very difficult to agree on ameaningful common definition of social housing. However, there seems to be consensus on that social housing is housing for those whose needs are not met by the open market and where there are rules for allocating housing to benefit households . In such a context the experience carried out by the Programma Housing della Compagnia di San Paolo, in close collaboration with the Ufficio Pio since 2009, and in partnership with other external parties has promoted two experimental projects aimed at building two Temporary Dwellings in Turin. Temporary Dwellings can be defined as structures intended for subjects in a situation of housing vulnerability or who need transitory housing solutions; they are characterised by the temporariness of the guests' stay, by limited rent costs and by the opportunity, for people living there, of enjoying common services and spaces. These buildings may represent one possible response to the growing housing needs expressed by a segment of the population that is placed in the so-called grey zone of income, that is a range that does not allow access to programs of public housing, but at the same time it is not sufficient to cover the costs of the rent that characterise the market rent. The paper discusses the results emerging from a research carried out since 2010 by SiTI on a social housing intervention currently in progress. The aim of the research relays in defining a model useful to control the building integrated sustainability, especially regarding some operating variables such as plants typology, building technologies or inhabitants income burdens, all affecting housing cost components. The emerging results evidence that it is effectively possible to balance the housing costs components (rent rates and operating expenses) with the energetic performances of the building, reaching up to -60% of energetic expenses and up to -10% on the housing cost variables as a whole. The results highlight the importance of defining flexible scenarios also for the Temporary Dwellings manager. The value of the analysis lies in showing how to take into account architecture, plants and relative impacts on housing costs, in order to define the best mix of technical and operating inputs, to foresee and adjust the economic and social variables themselves, also in relation to a specific urban location and a peculiar mixite of inhabitants",

Furthermore, destructive stereotypes may form during the educational process as students construct their own professional identity, in part learnt from their teachers and peers, and naturalised by the academic and professional institutions that form the context of their education – a process of enculturation termed ‘professional socialization’ by social scientists (Cuff, 1991: 118). These stereotypes may lead ultimately to inter-professional tensions and hostilities. Innovations in practice often involve challenges to established roles or joined-up thinking which breaches institutional structures, for all of which graduates may be ill-prepared.",

      "title": "Trust in disaster resilience",
      "abstract": "Purpose The erosion of ‘trust’ (among citizens as well as within and between institutional levels) is a worrying aspect of these turbulent times in Europe and beyond. Trust (between citizens and institutions, citizens and experts, policymakers and experts, and among different levels of governance) is crucial in all dimensions of disaster resilience. Risk perceptions stem from a complex web of feedback between individuals, communities, institutions, and experts. Sometimes, institutions and experts are slow or even resistant to accepting signals and knowledge about risks coming from the grassroots. Or, it is the other way around, and citizens are skeptical about the information coming from institutions and experts. Thus, trust must work in all directions (from citizens to institutions, from experts to citizens, etc.) to build a cooperative framework for action. Design/methodology/approach Our article aims to explore the construction of trust and distrust in communities dealing with historical, actual, or potential disasters by putting forward a three-dimensional approach (societal, cooperative, and institutional). We convey the idea that less tangible aspects such as culture, contextual history, knowledge, and habits shape the perception of risk, the degree of preparedness and, ultimately, the impacts of environmental changes. Findings These elements affect cooperative behaviors, and it is expected that the institutional environment – which will vary across domestic, national, and regional contexts – will play a significant role in nurturing trust or distrust in relation to disaster risk. Originality/value This article will offer valuable insights by developing a new conceptual framework that can be translated and validated by future research.",

Nevertheless in several cases, precise studies have shown that certain problems arise particularly due to social relationships. As a result production is reduced (in growth rate, in milk yield…). The study of the behaviour of domestic animals, and especially of their social relationships, is an essential prerequisite to the development of rational management technics which take into account the demands of the various species. In domestic cattle, the detailed study of the mechanism of interindividual relationships (dominance, affiliative relationships) allows us to propose solutions to specific management problems.",

En el transporte, la industria metalica, la mineria, el sector agroganadero, la manufactura, los servicios..., los procesos de trabajo, la tecnologia y la organizacion productiva en general, responden a un esquema coincidente, que parece no traslucir las diferencias entre el trabajo (como proceso tecnico y social) en una empresa propiedad de una multinacional del sector, y una empresa que sea propiedad de sus trabajadores en cualquiera de sus formas juridicas posibles (cooperativa, sociedad laboral...). Nada deja entrever, en el caracter del propio trabajo, la radical diferencia que supone que en el primer caso los operarios sean exclusivamente trabajadores por cuenta ajena, y que en el segundo la mayoria sean propietarios al mismo tiempo que trabajadores (en algunos casos incluso manteniendo una relacion de trabajo por cuenta ajena con una empresa de la que ellos mismos sean propietarios). No obstante, cualquier experiencia de economia social aspira a transformar la significacion, el sentido del trabajo dentro de la organizacion.

If we trace it deeply, actually the things happen because of the character of the people inside the organization itself. To fix it, the program does not give much help.

      "abstract": "Craft specialization means that certain tasks and/or activities are performed exclusively by certain members of a community, either as their main/basic activity, or parallel to other activities. The emergence of specialization is often associated to complex societies, or more precisely, its presence presupposes social stratification and is negated in non-stratified societies. However, the organization of production of various goods and the development of specialization are much more complex, and cannot be simply characterized in terms of presence/absence, since there are various modes and levels of specialization. Therefore, over the last decades the need is recognized for a new revised theoretical framework. Some authors suggest new definitions of specialization and production organization, specifically emphasizing social and cultural aspects (along with the purely economic ones) that influence the technological choices. Power and prestige status are not solely linked to control over resources and larger amount of material goods, but also to their character – prestige objects are an important factor in the development of crafts, the emergence of craft specialization, and emergence/increase in social inequality. In praehistory, the symbolic importance and value were ascribed to certain technologies and objects, not only on the grounds of exotic raw material or other highly valued qualities (durability of an object, as well as non-utilitarian traits, such as colour), but also due to the effort and skill applied in their production. Such prestige objects secured or reflected the esteem and status to the individuals who made and/or possessed them.",

      "title": "A STUDY ON MILITARY REGISTERS USED BY “ARHANUD” COMMUNITY KARANGPLOSO MALANG",
      "abstract": "Human is social creature. It means that people cannot live without any help from others. They need to interact, communicate, shares ideas, transfer knowledge and get some information with other people by using a language. “Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires, by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols” (Sapir, in Alwasilah, 1993: 6). People use a language to communicate with their society. It is proved by Wardhaugh (2003: 1) that a language is what the members of a particular society speak. However, speech in almost any society can take many very different forms. They create new varieties of language.\r\nAccording to Trask (1999: 282) “Sociolinguistics is the branch of linguistics which studies the relation between language and society.” Wardhaugh (2003: 12) has explained, “Sociolinguistics is concerned with investigating the relationships between language and society with the goal being a better understanding of the structure of language and of how languages function in communication.” Another expert, Marjohan (1988: 1) has stated, “Sociolinguistics is a branch of linguistics which studies language variation and its relation to social variation.” In short, sociolinguistics is the study of language that learns and discusses all of the aspects of language used in society especially language variation as the function in communication of society.\r\nLanguage and society influence one another. It is impossible to understand one without the other. It also influences the speech community. Speech community is a group of people who regularly interact by speaking. “A speech community may be large or small, and it may be highly homogeneous or decidedly heterogeneous” (Trask, 1999: 285). Bolinger (in Hudson 1982: 28) identifies the groups as speech community and stresses the unlimited amount of complexity that is possible:\r\nThere is no limit to the ways in which human beings league themselves together for self-identification, security, gain, amusement, worship, or any of the other purposes that are held in commons consequently there is no limit to the number and variety of speech communities that are to be found in society.\r\n\r\nAccording to these definitions, any groups of people (doctor, farmer, music community, military etc.) or population (whether of a city, a village, or whole state) may be expected to contain a very large number of speech communities. In addition, ARHANUD members are considered as speech community. Moreover, the existence of speech community creates many kinds of language variation. Hudson (1982: 24) has defined “A variety of language as a set of linguistic items with similar social distribution.” One of the language variations is a “register”.\r\nAs Ferguson (in Wardhaugh 2003: 51) says, “People participating in recurrent communication situations tend to develop similar vocabularies, similar features of intonation, and characteristic bits of syntax and phonology that they use in these situations.” This kind of variety is a register. “Journalese, baby-talk, legalese, the language of auctioneers, race-callers, sport commentators, the language of airline pilots, criminals, financiers, politicians and disc jockeys, the language of the courtroom and the classroom, could all be considered examples of different registers. The term ‘register’ here as the language of groups of people with common interests or jobs, or the language used in situations associated with such groups” (Holmes,2001: 246). Holmes also stated “Others use the term ‘register’ more narrowly to describe the specific vocabulary associated with different occupational groups” (2001: 246). It also happens in military community especially ARHANUD community in Karangploso Malang. They use military English registers in order to make simple in their conversation.\r\nThere are some studies related with the phenomenon of register. In 2005, Sari had studied about the register used by the employees of shoe company Artisan Jaya Internusa Makmur in Malang. The result of her study showed that there were two kinds of registers: formal register and informal register. There were 142 formal registers and 4 informal registers. Further, Sari (2005) also found that there were 3 main reasons why they used the English registers. First, it made the communication run easier and simpler because it could make the discourse understandable by the listeners and it shortened the interlocution. Second, the English registers could show the identity of the employees as the persons who were advanced in shoe industry. Last, the employees were accustomed to using the English registers as their medium in communication in the shoe company. In 2006, Handayani also described the register that was used in Unit Pelayanan Internet (UPI) as internet service provider. In her thesis, Handayani (2006) found that there were 144 registers used in UPI of University of Muhammadiyah Malang. The registers were used in such activities as meeting and working, in training conduct, recruitment test and when the staff talked to client. After reading both of the theses above, the writer gets an inspiration to know the real application of register which may occur in other professions or communities not only in the shoe company or UPI. \r\nThe writer chooses the members of ARHANUD because she wants to study the registers for professional purpose-military-. Further, the members of ARHANUD use the English registers effectively in every communication. Basically, their language mixes the registers used by the military. It means that if they want to communicate each other, they use Indonesian language but sometimes they use the registers in their conversation. As a matter of fact, the registers usually used by ARHANUD community are taken from English.\r\nMoreover, the registers used by ARHANUD community are called military registers. The military registers require succinctness and firmness in the form of abbreviation and acronym. Therefore, if the military registers are used in a public area, which has many kinds of community, it can cause misunderstanding except certain terms that have been known by the public. Because of those phenomena, it is considered that ARHANUD community is important to be analyzed and this will give contribution to sociolinguistics study.",

Groups in both domains can be quite diverse in terms of the composition and personality characteristics of members, the purpose and goals of the group, and the contextual setting in which the group functions. A variety of factors likely affect and influence the structure and functioning of any given group. Many, if not most, of these factors can potentially influence the group, regardless of the domain (electronic or face-to-face) and produce similar outcomes. There are qualities of electronic communication settings and qualities of physical settings that can uniquely influence the dynamics of a group in those respective settings (see McKenna & Green, 2002; McKenna & Seidman, 2005 for reviews).",

Sorokin, that social things or values move from a certain social position to other social positions. However, I do not deal with such conception of “Social Mobility, ” instead, I focus on how an individual moves socially or how his social position changes between the generations of a family. Namely, here social mobility means the transition of an individual or a family from one social stratum to another. The social stratum, in this sense, includes a concept of “region.” Regional mobility is considered at the same time.In this case, the following two points are taken into consideration as a way of analysis: First of all, regarding “education” as an independent variable and “social mobility” as a dependent one, (a) a fact that the ascending of the educational standard and the tendency for higher school career increase the social mobility and (b) a fact that the tendency for higher school career in turn brings the descending phenomenon of an occupational ladder which makes the rising tendency of stratum slow. Because of the social mobility of the persons who have a long school career, regional differences become a problem.Secondly, regarding “social mobility” as an independent variable and “education” as dependent one, it is clarified that the social mobility of population causes a new educational problem in both an overpopulated area and depopulated one.",

      "abstract": "Modifications of geographical spaces and social rhythms contribute jointly to an evolution of the link between individuals and urban territories. This is characterized, in terms of mobility, by an evolution of distances and proximity concepts. The development and the generalization of the car use allow motorized travels to be, all the more, longer and complex. By consequence, these allowed to an improvement of the geographical accessibility in urban territories.Moreover, the social assertion, a strong requirement of social and professional participation in social relationships, leads persons to move according to increasingly complex activities patterns. One of the issues of urban mobility is thus connected with problems of equal chances. Indeed, territorial or social disparities jointly have consequences, first, on the access to a mode. On a second time, transportation inflicts constraints (S. Rosales Montano and al., 2002). Nevertheless, mobility is a right that everyone must lay out. Because of theses disparities, individuals do not have all the same chances - capabilities (A. Sen, 1985) - to access the urban amenities. Then, be able to benefit the whole amenities returns to a social accessibility question and to treat conditions of equal opportunity between individuals. While reconsidering the condition of equal chances for everyone, it is possible to take into account situations of various categories of population relating to their needs and their capabilities through the unit for amenities.Therefore, this research will attempt, in urban area, to analyse, on infra-communal level, the social and space access to activities - corresponding to the individuals' basket of goods - and to the potential employment market. It focuses on characterizing the activities potentially accessible to dwellers (equal/unequal realization appropriateness). The purpose is made with the knowledge of which individuals' groups profit from accessibility to the activities - with a detailed consideration on socio-economical disadvantaged population. Are not urban territories sources of chances inequalities? Theses analysis will be specified by introducing a differentiation on modes, taking into account the potential access to a car and the availability of urban collective for disadvantaged population.What could be summarize by Accessibility to what, for whom, and how?",

However, according to the editors, linguistic ethnography has to face such challenges as (i) what it is that might distinguish linguistic ethnography as an emerging interdisciplinary field from its adjacent approaches (e.g. interactional sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology), (ii) how practicing linguistic ethnography may offer new insights to the study of social life, and (iii) how linguistic ethnographic research is compatible with concepts and visions in different disciplines in addressing social issues (pp. 4–5).

      "title": "Collective professional identity in the implementation of collaborative strategy : a case study from Scottish community addiction teams",
      "abstract": "This paper examines the discursive construction of collective professional identity (CPI) among different professional groups (i.e. nurses and social care workers) involved in the implementation of a collaborative strategy. We use the term CPI in order to distinguish these professional groups from other social and organizational categories (e.g. top management teams, middle managers, operational workers). The notion of CPI arises from Hardy, Lawrence & Grant's (2005: p62) approach of collective identity which is viewed as 'a discursive object' produced and/or reproduced by members in 'talk and other forms of text' to manifest their belongingness to a social category (e.g. group and organization). This categorization of collective identity can become problematic when members from different professional groups are assigned to work collaboratively (Beech & Huxham, 2003; Maguire & Hardy, 2005), in a new organizational context (Salk, 1996; Vaara, 2001; Wondeolleck, Gray & Bryan, 2003). In-group preferences and out-group discrimination can be formed between different professional group members in the collaboration process which may lead to collaborative inertia (Huxham and Vangen, 2005). Therefore, it is crucial to examine how professional members conceptualize their collective identity which is developed from the collaboration with their partners (Maguire & Hardy, 2005; Hardy et al., 2005). CPI has recently received increased attention from researchers in collaboration studies. For example, Wondolleck et al. (2003) explored how the characterization of CPI enhanced and diminished conflict between collaborating parties in collaborative practice. Maguire & Hardy (2005) examined CPI of management teams who were referred to as „champions‟ in the collaborative strategy making process within the Canadian HIV/AIDS treatment domain. However, little research has been conducted to examine the CPI of front-line professional workers in the implementation of collaborative strategy. This study focuses on the CPI of front-line professional workers outside of top management teams, as they play a critical role in implementing collaborative strategies and achieving collaborative advantage (Huxham & Vangen, 2005).",

Surveys of social capital and health often use measures of social networks and social support in order to measure social capital, and this is problematic for two reasons. First, theoretical assumptions about social networks and social support being part of social capital are contestable. Second, the measures used inadequately reflect the complexity and ambivalence of social relationships, often assuming that all social ties and contacts are of similarly value, are mutually reinforcing, and, in some studies, are based on neighbourhoods. All these assumptions should be questioned. Progress in our understanding requires more qualitative research and improved choice of indicators in surveys; social network analysis may be a useful source of methodological and empirical insight.",

Arbeitslosigkeit weist (immer noch) den Charakter eines mehr oder weniger deutlichen Stigmas auf, das seinen Träger diskreditierbar macht und — so es entdeckt wird — auch diskreditiert. Weil darüber (nicht nur) die soziale Identität des Betroffenen (mit)definiert wird, treten Veränderungen in der Selbst- und (antizipierten) Fremdwahmehmung sowie im Selbstwertgefühl auf. Die Stigmatisierung kann dabei sehr wohl (in)direkt negativen Einfluß nehmen auf partnerschaftliche und/oder familiale Beziehungen sowie Netzwerkkontakte, also das soziale Kapital. Gerade die Individualisierungstheorie betont die große Bedeutung der Netzwerkintegration für die soziale Identität, vor allem in großstädtischen Milieus (vgl. Keupp 1990). Die erweiterten Möglichkeiten der Gestaltung und die gestiegenen Notwendigkeiten, sich in externe Netzwerke zu integrieren, variieren mit einer Reihe sozialer Kontextvariablen. Dazu gehören Haushaltsstruktur bzw. Haushaltsgröße: Einpersonenhaushalte zeichnen sich prinzipiell durch eine erhöhte Notwendigkeit zur Beziehungsarbeit aus, da Binnennetze, anders als in familialen Haushalten (darunter fallen auch Haushaltungen mit erwachsenen und evtl. arbeitslosen Kindern), wo ein biologisch-soziales Netz bereits vorgegeben ist, nicht vorhanden sind. Ungeachtet des Erwerbsstatus bestehen damit auch im Hinblick auf die Zeitökonomie insofern ungleichheitsrelevante Momente, da Einpersonenhaushalte mehr Zeit in die Pflege des Freundes- und Bekanntenkreises investieren müssen als Mehrpersonenhaushalte und deshalb eine größere zeitliche Reglementierung erfahren.",

      "title": "Social Work and De-professionalization",
      "abstract": "Social work may be distinguished as one of the caring professions which has developed an overt concern with the process of professionalization. This is not to suggest that the issue of professionalization has not had a vital place in the analysis of, and debates about, nursing or occupational therapy. What is peculiar to social work is the way in which concepts of professionalization have been used explicitly in the formation of occupational identity and related social structures at specific points in the twentieth century. Social work is often regarded as a new profession, although in relation to similar occupations this may be something of a misattribution. The emergence of social work as an occupation can be seen to have begun in the second half of the nineteenth century, parallel with the development of nursing, and just prior to the emergence of occupational therapy as a single, distinct entity.",

Perhaps they are used as a cover up; something to shade deficiencies in our current system.",

      "title": "Cross-scale cooperation enables sustainable use of a common-pool resource",
      "abstract": "In social-ecological systems (SESs), social and biophysical dynamics interact within and between the levels of organization at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Cross-scale interactions (CSIs) are interdependences between processes at different scales, generating behaviour unpredictable at single scales. Understanding CSIs is important for improving SES governance, but they remain understudied. Theoretical models are needed that capture essential features while being simple enough to yield insights into mechanisms. In a stylized model, we study CSIs in a two-level system of weakly interacting communities harvesting a common-pool resource. Community members adaptively conform to, or defect from, a norm of socially optimal harvesting, enforced through social sanctioning both within and between communities. We find that each subsystem's dynamics depend sensitively on the other despite interactions being much weaker between subsystems than within them. When interaction is purely biophysical, stably high cooperation in one community can cause cooperation in the other to collapse. However, even weak social interaction can prevent the collapse of cooperation and instead cause collapse of defection. We identify conditions under which subsystem-level cooperation produces desirable system-level outcomes. Our findings expand evidence that collaboration is important for sustainably managing shared resources, showing its importance even when resource sharing and social relationships are weak.",

Nevertheless, among the theoretical considerations on the issue, it is possible to identify three types of links: 1) cultural expressions as an axis of the CSR; 2) cultural sponsorship and marketing along with CSR as components of corporate communication strategy; and 3) support of cultural activities as a way to project an image of CSR.

Social science has an important influence on the definition of well-being by social policy agencies and in society. This influence has the side-effect of transferring the limited scientific view on reality to social policy and social services. To prevent negative effects on the well-being of the elderly population, there is a need of ethical norms for social science research. Social science is increasingly a collective activity, for example by means of research programs. That is the reason why the individual ethical norms of the research-worker are not sufficient. Proposed is the development of a collective social ethic for social research. This ethic would guarantee that scientists are concerned with the totality of human needs, with the desirability of continuity in the life situation of people, and with future generations.",

      "abstract": "Politik organisasi digambarkan sebagai tindakan yang tidak secara resmi\r\ndisetujui oleh suatu organisasi untuk mempengaruhi orang lain guna mencapai tujuan”\r\nGreenberg & Baron, (dalam Chen & Fang 2008) akan nampak seperti suatu fakta\r\nhidup organisasi tidak bisa diacuhkan dalam kehidupan suatu organisasi. Perilaku\r\npolitik dalam suatu organisasi seperti tempat berlindung dan tunduk kepada perbedaan\r\ndi dalam sebuah persepsi. Mereka yang gagal untuk mengenal perilaku berpolitik\r\nmengabaikan kenyataan bahwa organisasi merupakan bagian dari sistem politik. Akan\r\nmenjadi baik apabila semua organisasi atau kelompok – kelompok formal dalam\r\norganisasi dapat digambarkan saling mendukung, harmonis, saling percaya, bekerja\r\nsama, atau saling menyatu. Suatu wawasan yang nonpolitis dapat mempengaruhi\r\nseseorang untuk percaya bahwa pekerja akan berperilaku secara konsisten pada\r\nkeinginan organisasi. Sebaliknya, suatu pandangan politik dapat menjelaskan banyak\r\nhal tentang perilaku yang tampaknya irasional dalam organisasi. Hal tersebut dapat\r\nmembantu untuk menjelaskan, misalnya mengapa pekerja menahan informasi,\r\nmembatasi output, mempublikasikan keberhasilan mereka, menyembunyikan\r\nkegagalan mereka dan terlibat dalam aktivitas serupa yang bertentangan dengan\r\nkeinginan organisasi pada efektivitas dan efisiensi. Dalam Robbins (2003), ada dua\r\nfaktor yang mempengaruhi perilaku berpolitik yang pertama adalah faktor - faktor\r\nindividu, para pekerja yang otoriter , cenderung berisiko tinggi, atau memiliki tempat\r\npengaturan eksternal (menyakini bahwa tekanan dari luar diri mereka mengatur takdir\r\nmereka) berperilaku secara politis tanpa memperhatikan 1 konsekuensinya terhadap organisasi. Suatu kebutuhan yang tinggi terhadap kekuasaan otonomi, keamanan, atau\r\nstatus, juga merupakan pendukung utama terhadap kecenderungan pekerja untuk\r\nterlibat dalam berperilaku politik. Faktor kedua yang mempengaruhi perilaku\r\nberpolitik adalah faktor – faktor organisasi, aktivitas perilaku berpolitik lebih\r\nmerupakan fungsi budaya organisasi karena kebanyakan organisasi yang memepunyai\r\nsejumlah besar pekerja dengan karakteristik yang berbeda – beda, masih\r\nmenunjukkan perilaku berpolitik yang beragam secara luas. Budaya yang ditandai\r\ndengan kepercayaan yang rendah, kerancuan peraturan , sistem penilaian kinerja yang\r\ntidak jelas, kegiatan yang tanpa alokasi dana penghargaan, pembuatan keputusan\r\nsecara demokratis, tekanan yang tinggi terhadap kinerja, dan manajer senior yang\r\nmandiri akan menciptakan kesempatan bagi terpeliharanya aktivitas – aktivitas\r\npolitik. Semakin kecil kepercayaan dalam sebuah organisasi, semakin tinggi tingkat\r\nberperilaku politik. Jadi, kepercayan tinggi dapat menekan tingkat berpolitik.\r\nMembangun kepercayaan, kerjasama dan integritas bukan merupakan hal yang\r\nmudah. Proses untuk membangunnya dibutuhkan proses panjang apalagi jika\r\nkebohongan dalam proses politik sebelumnya terungkap dan berpengaruh negatif bagi\r\norganisasi. Untuk itu diperlukan kemampuan diplomasi dan taktik untuk memperbaiki\r\nkembali image yang tercoreng akibat kebohongan masa lalu agar kepercayaan,\r\nkerjasama dan integritas dapat dibangun kembali. Menurut Chen & Fang (2008)\r\ndalam penelitiannya terdapat tiga dimensi antara lain Organizational practices and\r\npolicies (praktek dan kebijakan organisasi), Colleagues behavior ( perilaku rekan\r\nkerja) dan Go along to get ahead ( Untuk terus mencapai tujuan).",

Along with a persisting and even increasing level of inequality of the development of particular countries and regions, there is an ongoing internationalization of various spheres of social life. Global problems of mankind are coming to be of increasing urgency, problems that will be impossible to solve unless national and state boundaries are transcended, while still carefully considering national specificities. The necessity of exploring these tendencies in depth has led to the emergence of a special field of scientific research—comparativistics (derived from the word \"comparative\" in English). Its principal function is to afford a comparative analysis of societal processes, social institutions, and models of the cultures of various countries. Comparative pedagogy also functions within the framework of this field of study.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is a convention of social-science practice to define as early as possible in the project the terms one is using in it. With ‘social order’ and ‘social control’ there are considerable difficulties with this approach since distinctive meanings and interpretations abound. These are by no means always in competition or in conflict. Rather they reflect very disparate forms and usages applied by discrete groups of scholars to their own areas with little interest or awareness of what occurs elsewhere. This scene remarkably resembles that of Shakespearian comedies such as As You Like It or The Tem/Jest where characters in another part of the forest or elsewhere on the isle obliviously engage in contemporary activities. In order to simplify a multiply complex and scattered situation I shall adopt and adapt the terminology used by Sinfield who writes of the ‘social division of control’ (1978: 138) and consider the sociological division of control first.",

      "title": "The Vicious Circle of Hostility from Western Societies towards Refugees, Asylum-Seekers and Immigrants : Picture-Elicitation Instrument for Assessment, Intervention and Advocacy",
      "abstract": "espanolLa hostilidad, la rabia y la desconfianza hacia los refugiados, los solicitantes de asilo y los inmigrantes (RASI) que llegan a las sociedades occidentales no solo perjudican el bienestar biopsicosocial de los afectados, sino que tambien destruyen su confianza en los servicios de atencion y en los profesionales de ayuda. El contenido de los medios de comunicacion, las duras politicas de migracion y el discurso politico influencian negativamente las opiniones y actitudes de las sociedades hacia los RASI. Ser maltratado, a su vez, conduce a sentimientos como la defension aprendida, la tristeza, la ira, la desesperacion, el aislamiento social y, en algunos casos, lleva a los afectados a refugiarse en comportamientos de riesgo para uno mismo o para los demas. La incorporacion a mafias, la tendencia al extremismo o la radicalizacion son estrategias de afrontamiento potencialmente utilizadas para hacer frente a situaciones de desesperacion, conduciendo a un circulo vicioso de hostilidad de las sociedades de acogida hacia los RASI y viceversa. Con la aportacion de 34 expertos internacionales que trabajan en 18 paises de cuatro continentes, se elaboro una nueva herramienta (Picture Elicitation Instrument - PEI) para evaluacion, intervencion y advocacy. En una muestra de 509 RASI latinos, una version mas corta de la Anger Rumination Scale_19, la ARS_13, revelo ser eficaz para discriminar entre cuatro categorias de RASI: Social Desirability, Chewing, Grudge y Vegeance. Un analisis de correspondencias multiples se llevo a cabo con estas cuatro categorias y otras tres variables: grupos de edad, respuestas a la escala de emociones del PEI y tres niveles de aislamiento. Los analisis revelaron que todos los grupos de edad en la muestra se veian afectados por los escenarios de discriminacion, pero los mas jovenes (18 a 29 anos) fueron los que revelaron una mayor tendencia al resentimiento (Venganza y Rencor), apuntaban mas a la Desesperacion y tenian mayores niveles de aislamiento social. Estos son atributos que, segun la literatura, pueden influir en la radicalizacion y el comportamiento violento. Por lo tanto, estos resultados ofrecen una aportacion importante a la literatura, ya que proponen un nuevo instrumento (PEI) que puede utilizarse para el desarrollo de intervenciones para aliviar el sufrimiento de los RASI y, simultaneamente, abogar por un tratamiento mas humano para estas personas y contribuir a sociedades mas compasivas. EnglishHostility, anger and mistrust towards refugees, asylum-seekers and immigrants (RASI) who arrive in Western societies, not only damage the biopsychosocial Well-being of those affected, but also undermines their trust in helping professional and care services. Media content, harsh migration policies and political discourse all affect societies’ negative views and attitudes towards RASI. Being mistreated, in turn, leads to feelings like helplessness, sadness, anger, despair, social isolation and, in some cases, to find ways of coping that are harmful to self or others. Joining mafias, extremism or radicalization are potential coping strategies used in the midst of despair, leading to a vicious circle of hostility from host societies towards RASI and vice-versa. With the input of 34 international experts working in 18 countries in four continents, a new tool (PEI) was developed for assessment, intervention, and advocacy. In a sample of 509 Latin RASI, a shorter version (ARS_13) of the ARS_19 was efficient in discriminating between four categories of RASI: “Social desirability”, “Chewing”, “Grudge”, and “Vengeance”. MCA was conducted on these categories with three other variables: age groups, answers to the emotion-scale from the PEI and levels of withdrawal. The analyses revealed that all age groups of RASI were affected by the discrimination scenarios, but the youngest (18-29) were the ones revealing the greatest tendency for resentment (“Vengeance” and “Grudge”), pointed more to “Despair”, and had higher levels of social isolation. These are attributes that, according to the literature, may influence radicalization and violent behaviour. Therefore, these results make a positive contribution to the literature by offering a new instrument (PEI) that can be used for the development of interventions to alleviate the suffering of RASI and, simultaneously, advocate for more humane treatment for these people and contribute to more compassionate societies.",

      "title": "The social capital applied to cross-border cooperation in the cross-border regions of Alentejo-Algarve-Andalucía and southern Finland-Estonia",
      "abstract": "The cross-border cooperation (CBC) has been subject of study since eighties, and there is a wide empirical research since the implementation of first community initiatives like Interreg, receiving much of attention from the institutional realm. However, in last decade there has been an interest in the study of CBC from different disciplines which try to deliver the reaiity of day to day in border regions and the cross-border cooperation focused in the study of identities, border citizens� perspective and informal border relations. At the same time, the study of social capital (SC) has emerged in the last decades and is applied to diverse fields of interest. Among them the cross-border cooperation is a new and interesting area of research. The SC refers to the study of social relations and aspects like trust that facilitate the collective action. Social capita! can be approached in its cognitive (trust, norms), and/or structural (networks) dimension with the development of the social network analysis, an empirical mathematic method that explains systematically how with the investment on networks or relations social actors are capable to obtain benefits or to pursuit a certain collective action. In this context, this thesis tries to unify the institutional and more formal approach of CBC with a more social and informal based on SC theories and application of network analysis to offer a new approach to the study of CBC. The main goal is to study the construction of the cross-border social capital emerged from the institutional cross- border cooperation, focused on experts and institutions participating in EU cross-border cooperation; and to compare how is developed this cross-border social capita! in two different cross-border regions: Alentejo-Algarve- Andalucla and Southern Finland-Estonia. The methodology is qualitative-quantitative, using first a semi-structured interviews with a questionnaire and a module of social network analysis applied to 45 experts on CBC; second, the network analysis of the secondary data of approved projects of the interreg A programme 2007-2013 in each cross-border region. This research aims to contribute to the lack of research from sociology and social capital on cross-border cooperation. From another prism of analysis results will try to shed some light into the reaiity of day to day CBC in these two different and distant cross-border regions within the European Union.",

      "title": "The social dimension of territorial cohesion.",
      "abstract": "There is a relative consensus about the multidimensional nature of territorial cohesion, encompassing economy, environment and society. However, its social dimension is rarely analysed (Faludi 2003, Schon, 2005). Following the Reports on Cohesion and EU ministerial meetings on spatial planning, this social dimension namely means “accessibility to basic services and facilities”. The lack of attention is usually explained by a lack of data. This paper proposes a way to overcome the crucial challenges of data availability. The objective is to show the interest of tackling social questions at a local scale (i.e a combination of LAU (Local Administrative Unit) 1 and 2 in the European context) and its feasibility: an appropriate methodology may provide interesting results even with a limited set of data. The methodology relies on the fuzzy sets theory. This theory helps identifying influence areas of service providers following different policy perspectives: the minimum offer of services; the overlap between influence areas; or the territorial weaknesses in terms of unique membership to a service provider. The combination of these three perspectives gives an image of the various situations of the LAU in terms of access to basic services. The results of the methodology underline crucial challenges in the definition of the concept of territorial cohesion. Firstly, the question of redistribution is raised – if a European cohesive territory means an equal access of citizens to basic services, how to achieve this goal in spite of different national traditions in the organisation and use of services? Secondly, the concept helps putting back the citizens at the heart of the analysis, as well as their needs in everyday life. This is worth considering, in a time of general scepticism about the European Union in terms of remoteness from everyday concerns, although this raises also the question of the European model of society in which the European citizens recognize.",

      "abstract": "catalaLes professions que treballen des de la relacio amb persones en un major o menor grau de fragilitat tenen molt present la seva dimensio etica, per diverses raons. En tractar-se de professions amb una molt alta carrega politica (perque es treballa habitualment amb persones vulnerables en escenaris d’injusticia), la sensibilitat moral dels professionals esta molt desenvolupada, pero aixo no assegura que es faci una adequada gestio dels conflictes de valor. Precisament, l’angoixa i el patiment es produeixen pel fet de tenir una alta sensibilitat moral pero no disposar d’eines per gestionar tot el que emocionalment i tecnicament representa l’exposicio als conflictes de valor. Les dades en recerques previes sobre que genera conflicte en els professionals de l’educacio social i del treball social i quines son les formes mes habituals per gestionar els conflictes de valor, apunten que la conflictivitat moral entre els professionals es alta pero es viu com si fos un problema de caracter personal i privat, de manera que no hi acostumen a haver estructures ni estrategies adequades de caracter professional promogudes per les institucions i/o serveis que permetin gestionar-les col·lectivament. Els plans d’estudi de les universitats mostren que les questions etiques de l’educacio social i del treball social estan presents en la formacio. En aquest monografic es dona a coneixer una recerca, liderada pel professor Dr. Jesus Vilar i subvencionada per la Catedra Ethos de la URL, en la qual els autors es plantegen si la forma com s’aborden aquestes questions en la formacio basica es la mes adequada i si realment capacita per afrontar responsablement i amb garanties les contradiccions de l’activitat professional. EnglishThe professions that work from the relationship with people with a higher or lower degree of fragility are very aware of their ethical dimensions, for different reasons. As these professions carry a highlevel of political burden (because they usually work with vulnerable people in contexts of injustice), the moral sensitivity of professionals is very developed, but this does not guarantee an appropriate management of conflicts of value. Precisely, anxiety and suffering result from the fact of having a high moral sensitivity but lacking the tools to manage all the aspects that being exposed to conflicts of value represents both emotionally and technically. Data from previous research on what causes conflict among social education and social work professionals and on what ways are the most usual to manage conflicts of value show that the moral conflict among professionals is high but lived as though it were a personal, established problem, and therefore it is not usual to have appropriate professional structures or strategies provided by the institutions and/or services to allow us to jointly manage them. The university syllabuses show that the ethical questions of social education and social work are present in the education. In this monograph issue, we present a research work, led by professor Jesus Vilar and funded by the URL Ethos Chair, where the authors consider whether the way how these issues are dealt with in the basic education is the most appropriate, and whether it really enables learners to face the contradictions of their professional activity in a responsible and sound manner.",

      "title": "Knowing poverty: Social workers’ perceptions of poverty knowledge",
      "abstract": "Summary Given the global and local social inequalities and the complex life circumstances of people living in poverty, social workers are called upon to broaden their knowledge with the purpose of developing social services that respond to the needs of this growing population. However, very little research has been done on the kind of knowledge that social workers require in order to care for this population. The present article focuses on the epistemological aspects of service development for people living in poverty and reviews three main issues: What is “poverty knowledge,” where does it come from, and what are the barriers to and opportunities for its development? These questions are investigated through a qualitative paradigm among social workers employed in Israel’s public social services. Findings Findings reveal a profound epistemological controversy about what poverty knowledge means: Is it objective, consistent, readily available, and transferrable knowledge, or is it a dynamic and reflexive process affected by a great number of fluctuating contexts? Findings stress the dominance of positivist views of poverty knowledge, mostly derived from practice while other sources of knowledge development, such as service users’ local knowledge, theory, and research knowledge were seen as less relevant to their needs. Applications Practical recommendations are offered relating to the need for poverty knowledge development processes in social services as well as in social-work education through collaborative, contextual, and reflective learning with and from service users and other stakeholders.",

      "title": "Modeling Use Diffusion",
      "abstract": "Two differential equations modeling the diffusion of use of cultural forms are developed as alternatives to an earlier model based on exponential epochs of diffusion. Both new models are similar in that they incorporate imitation and desertion effects, but differ in the manner in which these effects operate over the course of the diffusion of use. The model which has a Gompertz curve as its integrated form fits data from 17 instances of use diffusion better than the model which has a logistic curve as its integrated form and, in addition, is more parsimonious than the original exponential epoch model. The relationship between the observed values of the parameters representing imitation and desertion is discussed in the context of the process of use diffusion. Cultural diffusion has usually been thought of as the gradual spread of a cultural form among a population. Cultural forms can mean many thingsinformation, a custom, a role, a technical or social invention, a type of violence, even a psychiatric disorder. Their cumulative spread, adoption, or incorporation into the lifeways of a people is a much studied, well documented social process (see Chapin; Coleman et al.; Davis, a,b; Dodd, a,b; Griliches; Hamblin and Miller; Hamblin et al.; Hernes; Ogburn, c; Pemberton, a,b; Rogers, a,b; Ryan and Gross). While many feel that cultural diffusion is one of the most theoretically and methodologically developed lines of research in sociology, progress comes by successive approximations as important issues emerge from the collective effort and are resolved through further theoretical analysis and empirical investigation. The issue here is whether diffusion as a quantitative use process is better modeled by Gompertz or logistic equations or as exponential epochs. *The first author worked out the Gompertz model, including the imitation law.",

Egregious social and economic inequality are neither fashionable nor ideologically justifiable any more—at least not publicly. This constitutes a revolution in thought and social orientation. Inequalities in income and social status also make a great difference in a variety of ways. Perhaps most trenchant and relevant is that which has to do with a sense of significant membership in the society. It must be understood by any development planner that the vast majority of the people of the world have a great deal to lose, from their point of view, from any basic social change. There are a variety of ways in which nations can approach the goal of distributing the sense of membership and consequently of evoking the voluntary spirit and informed participation in national and local affairs.",

      "abstract": "Domaine majeur de la sociolinguistique, la question des politiques linguistiques (PL) demeure trop souvent rattachee aux pratiques, alors meme que les representations linguistiques (RL) y tiennent un role non negligeable. En effet, les RL correspondent a des connaissances socialement elaborees et partagees, se rapportant a l'objet langue. Elles disposent d'une visee pratique : elles participent a la gestion des comportements linguistiques, et concourent a la construction d'une realite linguistique commune a un ensemble social. Il est donc coherent de leur attribuer une fonction, que ce soit dans la definition d'une politique ou dans la facon dont celle-ci se confronte aux choix spontanes des acteurs sociaux. Quel peut etre le role des RL dans la conception, l'application et la reception d'une PL ? Inversement, de quelle influence dispose une PL dans la dynamique des savoirs sociaux partages ? Afin d'evaluer la nature des interrelations pouvant exister entre les RL et les PL, nous avons realise des enquetes en Suisse et en France. Ces etats connaissent tout deux des situations plurilingues, mais leurs gestions politiques de celles-ci presentent de nombreuses differences. Si, dans chacune de ces communautes, les representations relatives au plurilinguisme presentent des differences de formes et de contenus, est-il envisageable d'en rendre compte en determinant le degre d'influence mutuelle entre representation et politique ? Apres avoir propose une definition precise de la notion de RL et explicite notre demarche methodologique, nous nous appuierons sur des extraits de notre corpus pour tenter d'apporter certains eclaircissements a une problematique qui constitue un interface ideale entre ce qui est defini par le haut et ce qui est integre par en bas.",

      "abstract": "The responsibility of every individual is a key factor for the realization of each set goal. We cannot achieve anything in our life cycle without a serious and responsible approach to everything we undertake. But even the most responsible behavior of the individual is not a condition for personal success if it does not come across a fertile soil in the society in which it lives and does not fit into the social mosaic. The degree of individual responsibility is a prerequisite for social responsibility. At the same time, the level of social responsibility is a guarantee for creating equal opportunities in which citizens can achieve their needs responsibly. Social responsibility is a fiction, without individual responsibility. Conversely, individual responsibility is unattainable without social responsibility.Unfortunately, this inevitable social legitimacy is still not fully understood and accepted in societies with under-developed democracy, in which power still dominates against freedom, and social interest is overshadowed by personal and group interests. The experiences of most Balkan countries face us with the devolution of social responsibility, in which law and justice are perceived as a privilege of certain individuals and groups, and the establishment of guilt and responsibility becomes an unachievable goal.",

Evidence comes from a large-scale study conducted with 10 measures of independent vs. interdependent social orientation and 10 measures of analytic vs. holistic cognitive style. The social measures successfully distinguish between interdependence (viewing oneself as embedded in relations with others) and independence (viewing oneself as disconnected from others) at the group level. However, the correlations among the measures were negligible. Similar results were obtained for the cognitive measures, for which there are no coherent individual differences despite the validity of the construct at the group level. We conclude that behavioral constructs that distinguish among groups need not be valid as measures of individual differences.",

      "title": "Aging Well through Long-Standing Social Occupation: A Closer Look at Social Participation and Quality of Life in a Sample of Community-Dwelling Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Introduction Background Social participation is a lifelong process that contributes to both successful aging and quality of life. Social participation can be viewed as engagement in a variety of social occupations or activities that include interaction and shared experiences with others (Cohen 2003; Stevens-Ratchford and Cebulak 2004). Long-standing social participation contributes to aging well by fostering involvement in a variety of living situations and the related activities that create a sense of social connectedness. Social connectedness can be viewed as social participation or activities that include interaction with family, friends, peers, and the public in general. In this discussion social participation, social occupation, social activity, and social engagement are used interchangeably. Social participation creates relationships and social networks that build a system of social support that contribute to health and well-being states including life satisfaction and quality of life (Wilcock 1998; 2006; Christiansen and Baum 1997; Stevens-Ratchford and Cebulak 2004). In this sense social support is the perceived caring, esteem, and assistance that people receive from others, as well as the individual's provision of these elements of support. This support comes from family members, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and care providers (Haber 2003). Socially connected support contributes to emotional well-being by encouraging a sense of love, reassurance, and belonging. Social networks and their embedded resources can be a ready reserve of assistance in the form of information, advice, and help with decision making, problem resolution and other life management activities (Haber 2003). Social participation and its associated social connections and routines create opportunities for activities that in turn contribute to health and well-being, cognitive and physical function, and overall life involvement. Such social engagement not only adds meaning to life (Christiansen 1999), it also contributes to quality of life by fostering relationships, community participation, and the leisure enjoyment that is embodied in a high quality of life and an occupation-filled lifestyle that reinforces aging well (Vaillant 2003). The notions of life involvement and social participation can be related to occupational engagement, which is participation in meaningful activities including social occupations. Occupations in this sense are viewed as meaningful everyday activities and include everything from leisure pursuits to productive activities. These activities allow humans to establish roles, to interact socially, to express creativity, and in general to be involved in living situations that foster well-being and add meaning to life (Christiansen 1999; Christiansen and Baum 1997; Howie, Coulter, and Feldman 2004; Zemke and Clark 1996). Living situations involve a variety life activities including health, home, and financial management as well as celebrations, entertainment, hobbies, recreation, and other leisure and social occupations during which individuals interact and share experiences. Participation in an array of occupations that foster mental and physical function as well as develop social connections and networks of support can create lifestyles that promote health and well-being. Well-being is a complex physical, mental, and social state of overall contentment and satisfaction (Chritiansen and Baum 1997) with oneself and life. Health and well-being are necessary for everyday engagement in occupations. In turn this everyday participation perpetuates health and well-being. Health, well-being, and activity participation can influence and can complement each other and in concert can contribute to overall quality of life and life satisfaction (Davis and Friedrich 2004; Hyde, Wiggins, Higgs, and Blane 2003; Krause 2004; Schalock 2004; Smith, Borshelt, Maier, and Jopp 2002; Stevens- Ratchford 2005). …",

Each individual has tight and permanent relationships with close friends and relatives (strong ties) as well as random and transitory interactions within the community (weak ties). Workers can either be employed or unemployed. Some workers do not even participate in the labor market because they are engaged in criminal activities. Unemployed workers can find a job through strong ties (assumed not to be criminals), weak ties (some of them being criminals) as well as through formal methods (such as advertisement or employment agencies). We show that crime rate within a community increases the unemployment rate of this community. Indeed, when the crime rate increases, weak ties become less valuable in terms of information content about jobs since the likelihood to interact with a criminal is higher. The overall job information available through personal contacts decreases, frictions in the labor market are exacerbated, and unemployment rises.This predicted inter play between crime and unemployment, grounded on the social setting, is reminiscent of the epidemic theory of ghettos.",

      "abstract": "Demographic transformations in European and other industrialised countries do not only raise important challenges in the development of ageing policies but also offer new possibilities and perspectives.Responding to the challenges of population ageing on behalf of both governments and civil society is crucial for advancing higher levels of active and successful ageing.Undoubtedly, education and learning have a key role in improving the quality of life and well-being of middle-aged and older adults as they promise to strengthen social networks and social support, influence social solidarity, whilst also fostering economic development (Albertini, 2007; Bar & Russel, 2006;Henkin, 2007).Older adult learning also has immense potential to improve levels of productive ageing by ensuring that older workers have the necessary skills required by potential employment opportunities (Cahill et al., 2006;Chen & Scott, 2003).Last but not least, intergenerational learning contributes to the policy areas of community cohesion, community safety, health, and well-being by (i) bringing together different generations through meaningful activities and interactions, (ii) increasing understanding between generations, breaking down stereotypes and providing positive role models, and (iii) preventing anti-social behaviour and challenge perceptions (Schuller, 2010).Questions, however, remain on issues relating to social inclusion, participation, and civic engagement in relation to late-life learning.The research in Europe demonstrates that older adults are a very diverse population, having different learning, social needs and abilities, and that only small percentages of older population participate in formal and non-formal learning avenues.Findsen and Formosa (2011) describe those who participate in older adult and community education are generally those who have attended school more than an average amount of time and passed formal qualifications, women (although men tend to be in the majority in more vocationally oriented courses), persons aged 60 to 75 years, white ethnic groups, affluent members of the retired class, and people with strong white-collar occupational backgrounds.At the same time, it is often wrongly assumed that any kind of education is emancipatory and results in the improvement of the quality of life of the older adults, and that most education for the older adults is in their interest when -of course -this is not the case (Formosa, 2010).Finally, senior residents (Ginnane, 1981), are all related to intergenerational learning (Hatton-Yeo, 2007).The aim of this book is to give an overview on the different concepts, ideas, and meanings, related to older adults' education, learning and intergenerational learning through theoretical standpoints, empirical research, and policy directions.This research area in older adult education has expanded immensely in recent years since it raised questions that are connected to a rapidly ageing society in very turbulent times of economic and social changes in Europe.This book will provide the basis for more in-depth analysis of the understandings and interpretations of theoretical concepts on education and learning in later-life,",

      "title": "Collective Action and Local Development Processes",
      "abstract": "The theory of collective action focuses on the question of why individuals would cooperate in a social dilemma when they could free-ride on the contributions of others. The term “social dilemma” refers to a setting in which individuals choose actions in an interdependent situation. If each individual in such situations selects strategies based on a calculus that maximizes short-term benefits to self, individuals are predicted to take actions that generate lower joint outcomes than could have been achieved. In other words, a social dilemma can be analyzed as a game where the predicted equilibrium for a single iteration of the game yields less than the socially optimal outcome. The socially optimal outcome could be achieved if those involved “cooperated” by selecting strategies other than those prescribed by game theory. Since the suboptimal joint outcome is an equilibrium, no one is independently motivated to change their choice, given the predicted choices of all others. Such situations are dilemmas because at least one outcome yields higher returns for all participants, but rational participants making independent choices are predicted not to achieve this outcome. Social dilemmas involve a conflict between individual rationality and optimal outcomes for a group [Schelling 1978; Lichbach 1995]. Even if some individuals cooperate, others are predicted to “free-ride” on the contributions of the cooperators. In addition to the assumption regarding the structure of payoffs leading to a deficient equilibrium, further assumptions made in almost all models of social dilemmas include: 1. Decisions about strategies are made independently and simultaneously;",

      "abstract": "Society does not become “sustainable” by itself – even in the transition from an industrial society (intensive in resources) to an information society (intensive in knowledge).1 For this reason, it is necessary particularly for the advanced nations (if they want to follow a lasting path that is harmless to the environment and capable of handling the demands of the future ) to merge the guiding model [in German: “Leitbild”] of the “information”, “communication” or “knowledge society” with that of “sustainable development” in way that is useful (cf. Spangenberg et al. 2002). The European Union has – at least! – made a declaration in this regard. At its Lisbon summit in March, 2000, it was stated that: “the Union has today set itself a new strategic goal for the next decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion” (European Council 2000). Perhaps the term “worlds apart” doesn’t quite apply here, but – we all know that – there are often huge gulfs between an expression of intent, a self-obligation, and its implementation. In order to make some headway on this ambitious path, it is first necessary to (carefully) figure out the divergences and convergences between these models and the aims and objectives they recommend, between possible futures and practicable paths. Beyond the public relations work, the EU Commission is of course also aware of this, and – in Priority 7 “Citizens and governance in a knowledge based society” of its 6th framework programme – it announced support of a research intention that targeted precisely this issue.2",

      "abstract": "The guiding philosophy of communication for social change can readily be traced to the work of Paulo Freire (1970) the Brazilian educator who conceived of communication as dialogue and participation for the purpose of creating cultural identity trust commitment ownership and empowerment (in today’s term).The proposed model builds on this principle and a broad literature on development communication developed by practitioners communication activists and scholars (such as BeltranDiaz BordenaveCalvelo Shirley White Prieto Castillo Everett Rogers Mata Simpson Servaes Portales and Kincaid) as well as on theories of communication dialogue and conflict resolution. In bringing together the work of practitioners and scholars we have found that there is considerable agreement on the role of communication in development even though at various times over the last 30 years the two groups have diverged.

      "abstract": "Prosociality and cooperation are key to what makes us human. But different cultural norms can shape our evolved capacities for interaction, leading to differences in social relations. How people share resources has been found to vary across cultures, particularly when stakes are high and when interactions are anonymous. Here we examine prosocial behavior among familiars (both kin and non-kin) in eight cultures on five continents, using video recordings of spontaneous requests for immediate, low-cost assistance (e.g., to pass a utensil). We find that, at the smallest scale of human interaction, prosocial behavior follows cross-culturally shared principles: requests for assistance are very frequent and mostly successful; and when people decline to give help, they normally give a reason. Although there are differences in the rates at which such requests are ignored, or require verbal acceptance, cultural variation is limited, pointing to a common foundation for everyday cooperation around the world.",

To build my case, I introduce relevant concepts from Erving Goffman’s theory of Dramaturgic Analysis to interpret human-robot interactions. Following Goffman, I posit that we pre-reflectively adjust our behavior to communal expectations and perform as characters when interacting with other people in public. We tend to step into character when we encounter familiar social situations, which, I argue, includes those created by robots that mimic human social behavior. Our homes, ideally, enable us to set aside the characters we play in public to pursue private tasks associated with our well-being, autonomy, and intimate relationships. As such, when domestic social robots elicit social responses from users, they may rob users of time they could otherwise dedicate to valuable private activities—an issue I categorize as a privacy problem.",

Excluding other factors may help us predict easier (but not more accurately) future evolutions but as a scientific effort it is a bad practice. Much of the assumptions about technological change came from hasty generalizations. The changing nature of some collective actions, jobs in certain areas of the economy or organizations were considered as optimal (and necessary) paths for the entire society (from individual to national levels). Public administration reforms are far from being a consequence of new technologies. Moreover public administration reforms do not embed ICTs and do not have a happy marriage with e-government.",

      "abstract": "Studies of development, in their search for the deterrents to change, have often concentrated on factors such as traditional attitudes, superstitions, and lack of faith in new things. It is argued in this paper that there are other factors at work which may be far more crucial to the success or failure of change programmes. A social system, because of the ways in which the various strata within society relate to one another and to scarce resources, may itself impede aspects of modernisation in some ways. The interactions between the village social system and the administrative bureaucracies, for instance, may tend to reinforce existing power relations and act as a brake on change. On th.e basis of research reported in this paper the conclusion, seems inescapable that certain kinds of change cannot be carried out unless the planners and change agents themselves can be made aware of the importance of their own position and attitudes and of the ways in which these affect the development process. They have to be aware too of the kind of society they are trying to create and the longrange implications of what they are doing.",

The work deals with fundamental life motivation and preconditions for their implementation in young men of different ethnolinguistic groups in terms of existential fulfilment. It is shown as a similarity (due to a long common history in the groups of «Slavs-Turks» and well-expressed in all nations and nationalities by the concept of freedom), and the difference in scales of methodology by A. Langle and C. Orgler «Scale of Existence», conditioned for Eastern peoples by the commonality of religion and geographical features of residence, values, due to the ethnocultural characteristics of the surveyed persons. Therefore, in the process of medical and psychological support of people of different ethnolinguistic groups, it is necessary not only to pay attention to the evaluation of the characteristics of their personality, but also to take into account certain values (including religious norms) and expectations that are maintained within different cultures, as well as other circumstances, who can make psychological assistance effective or inconclusive. Since in the process of learning the personality is enriched, including by new psychological connections, relying on which and manipulating which it further solves the assigned professional tasks, when working with people, one must proceed from the basic components of self-awareness: self-understanding (cognitive aspect), relations to yourself (the emotional aspect); self-regulation (behavioral aspect). That is, all these tasks can be defined as the formation of new behaviours related to cooperation, mutual assistance, responsibility and autonomy that contribute to optimal adaptation, more successful social functioning in real life, and prevention of recidivism of unconstructive behaviour. However, a generalized view of behaviour and beliefs may not cover the diversity that exists within ethnic groups.",

      "title": "Exploring social mobilisation and participation and the potential for social change in contexts of tradition-bound social exclusion",
      "abstract": "Empowerment of the disadvantaged and the marginalised in a society is one of the inherent commitments of meaningful social mobilisation, both in theory and practice. One of the core aspects of social mobilisation is to engage with relations of power and reorganise them in favour of the disadvantaged. For a marginalised group in a community, this requires the capacity to define their goals and the environment or the freedom (to act) to achieve those goals – an aspect referred to in development literature as collective agency. Collective agency transforms into collective action when the interests of several social actors converge and lead to voluntary engagement to achieve a common cause. Community organisations, established through a process of social mobilisation, are increasingly viewed as a mechanism in community development to create collective agency, spur collective action and empower lower-status groups or the disadvantaged.However, some empirical studies conducted to scrutinise the potential of social mobilisation and community development programs have pointed to the risk of strengthening the traditional unequal relations of power instead of challenging them. They have also noted the potential for elite-capture of the spaces created through social mobilisation processes. In these respects, a gap between theory and practice was identified, namely, that the perceptions, viewpoints and experiences of the disadvantaged and the most marginalised at the grassroot level who are directly or indirectly affected by social mobilisation and community development programs are generally underexplored. Moreover, it was also realised that the success of social mobilisation programs is generally measured in terms of input versus output analysis rather than exploring their transformative potential and their impact on the overall power configuration in a social structure. The current research goes some way towards addressing this gap by exploring the relationship between social mobilisation, participation and social change and the processes involved in these strategies in the context of elite-based, tradition-bound and exclusionary decision-making and governance arrangements.  The research employed a qualitative case study method and involved document analysis, observation and interviews as instruments to explore and analyse people’s perceptions and experiences in relation to the empowerment potential of a ‘three-tier social mobilisation strategy’[1] spearheaded by the Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN)[2] in Chitral, a North-western rural district in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. The study specifically focused upon whether and how RSPN’s social mobilisation strategy has contributed to re-shaping traditional patterns of elite-based decision-making into more inclusive, participatory and democratic processes for social change.The study findings show that the community spaces created by RSPN do not truly represent the disadvantaged and the marginalised community. Instead, they have emerged as elite-captured formal entities. These organisations are used by their leaders (members of elite groups) for social exclusion of the disadvantaged and as means to conceal persistent power inequalities and to influence broader governance structures to meet their vested interests. Therefore, the empowerment potential of the socio-economic resources invested in or through these spaces was found to be limited.The study findings reveal that certain aspects embedded in the three-tier social mobilisation strategy, such as elite-based recruitment of community activists, project-bounded social activism and savings-focused community participation, allow members of elite groups to re-institutionalise their power. This, in turn, enables elites to capture new institutional spaces created by RSPN. The study found that outright capture of newly created community spaces by elites, the concentration of development funds in these organisations together with the ‘civic habitus’ shaped as a result of the people’s lived experiences of oppression, marginalisation and social exclusion, lead them to comply with the regime of power strategically – a phenomenon referred to as ‘strategic compliance’ in this study. The study findings further show that these conditions encourage the elites to extend their power both within the three-tiered organisational structures (provided by RSPN) and beyond, into external spaces such as local and District Council offices and even into provincial and federal parliaments.Overall, I conclude that intermittent, resource-focused mobilisation, bounded by project targets framed around limited tangible outcomes as goals of community development, is not only open to elite-capture but may provide institutional frameworks (organisational structures and processes) favourable to elites, further amplifying social exclusion of the less-powerful, as well as reproducing traditional relations of power and, ultimately, hindering future prospects for social change.[1] The term refers specifically to the RSPN strategy and any subsequent use of the term in the text will be in that context.[2] RSPN (http://www.rspn.org/) is a development network of ten member Rural Support Programmes (RSPs), operating independently, espousing a common approach to development centred upon social mobilisation. Throughout the thesis I distinguish between RSPN (the organisational network) and individual or multiple RSPs, as appropriate. ​​​​​​​",

      "abstract": "Indigenous peoples globally have continued their societies, cultures, knowledge systems, and close relationships with traditional territories in the face of challenges to erase, assimilate, and marginalize them.Despite this incredible resilience Indigenous peoples experience an elevated prevalence of nutrition-related chronic conditions and lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Gracey and King 2009).These health inequities arise from unjust inequalities in the social determinants of health: those that are commonly recognized (e.g., poverty, low educational attainment, and food insecurity) along with those that are unique to Indigenous peoples (e.g., colonial policies and practices of erasure and assimilation, racism and stigmatization, stolen lands and loss of food sovereignty, cultural genocide, exposure to trauma and violence, and inadequate distribution of social support and resources) (King et al. 2009).Research is urgently needed to identify what needs to change to improve the social determinants of health of Indigenous peoples; how to reduce the entrenched structural inequities that are affecting Indigenous peoples' capability to practice lifestyles and livelihoods that support healthy eating and active living; and which strength-based health-promotion interventions, programs, and policies can reduce health disparities.Recognizing this, Terry Graham, a former Editor-in-Chief of this journal, along with Wendy Ward, current Editor-in-Chief, had a vision to create this special virtual volume dedicated to better understanding how to improve Indigenous health and wellbeing in high-income countries.For the collection we (i.e., Blanchet and Willows) sought decolonizing health research that confronts colonialism and oppression, that serves the needs of Indigenous peoples, and that provides benefits to them.Decolonizing research is designed with opportunities for Indigenous people to make decisions that shape the research process and nurtures community-based solutions to problems of interest to the community.Strength-based research is characteristic of decolonizing research.Those who engage in it (researchers and community members engaged in the research process) recog-",

In recent years, there has been a growing, strongly accruing, realization that people are abreast of the knowledge/situation/information that is evolving continuously. More organisations are becoming aware of the importance of social interactions and relationships at work. Consequently, organisations are faced with a challenge to understand this phenomenon and its implications on the workplace. The enlightened few have recognized that social capital does occur in significant ways in our day to day friendship, courtship or colleagues (workship). It is in the acknowledgment of these new ways of interactions, heard through innumerous channels, that I believe, desired change will occur in our relationships. Additionally,the literature on social capital indicates that as a strategic business partner, there is an immediate need for the scholars and professionals in the field of human resource development to address this emerging challenge.",

      "abstract": "We are grateful to David Caughlin for his invaluable help in coordinating the conference in Budapest, and to the Open Society Institute and Rockefeller Foundation for their generous support of the conference. Arien Mack Editor A Note from the Conference Convenor Eastern Europe emerges from a Communist past where everything was officially “public,” privacy was unprotected, and the public sphere was etatized. The highly problematic public/private dichotomy of postmodernity is particularly complicated under conditions of postcommunism. Distortions of the public sphere (lack of transparency, skewed or monopolized public discourse ) are aggravated by attempts at penetrating into privacy in the name of public community values (in the case of abortion, for example). Transparency is denied in the name of privacy (“personality rights” of former secret police informants prevail in some countries against public interest and the rights of victims). Further , in part because of historical traditions, in many East European societies there is no genuine sense of privacy. These features are not systematically discussed in Eastern Europe. The Social Research Privacy conference at Central European University on March 23-24, 2001, helped to clarify certain crucial policy-relevant issues—for example, civic education for the development of a more responsive citizenry; data protection and access to information; the limits and responsibilities of journalism ; reproductive policies. More broadly, the conference offered a valuable point of reference and helped to put the East European issues into a global context, in terms of both prevailing influences and intellectual context.

      "abstract": "The contemporary leadership theories of Fiedler (LPC Contingency Theory), House (Path Goal, Vroom and Yetton (Decision Making) and Graen (Vertical Dyad Linkage) are commonly viewed as divergent, if not competing. The result is a fragmented leadership literature which contains little theoretical or empirical integration. The apparent diversity of these theories is substantially reduced and their common basic structures revealed if they are reconsidered in the context of a social influence-structure matrix, where social influence is the form or level of subordinate involvement in task matters, and social structure is the context in which managersubordinate interaction takes place.",

Neben der Makro- wird die Branchenebene explizit einbezogen, unterschieden werden jeweils die Phasen vor sowie nach Maastricht. Auf der Makroebene bleibt die Anzahl freiwilliger Verhandlungen gering. Die conditio sine qua non für den Erfolg ist die neue Möglichkeit, in einigen Bereichen mit qualifizierter Mehrheit Beschlüsse fassen zu können. Die Ausweitung des Einflusses der Sozialpartner stellt keine hinreichende Bedingung dar. Freiwillige Verhandlungen werden auch weiterhin nur eine untergeordnete Bedeutung haben. Die Kommission ist und bleibt der entscheidende Akteur. Auf der sektoralen Ebene haben die alten Dialogformen (Paritätische Ausschüsse, Informelle Arbeitsgruppen) zu keinen verbindlichen Rahmenabkommen geführt sondern lediglich Konsultations- und Beratungsaufgaben erfüllt. Die aktuelle Neustrukturierung seitens der Kommission führte im wesentlichen zu einer Replizierung der alten Strukturen. Auch in Zukunft ist kaum mit dem Abschluss einer größeren Zahl verbindlicher Rahmenverträge zu rechnen. Soziale Dialoge werden keinen wesentlichen Beitrag leisten können, die Kluft zwischen ökonomischer und sozialer Integration zu schließen.",

      "title": "Норма милосердия в русской языковой картине мира",
      "abstract": "Mercy norm is a summary of rules that asking for help and giving support persons have to follow. These rules are represented in the semantics of some words and proverbs. The mercy norm functioning is based on two kinds of estimations. Appraisal from good ideal dictates not to damage somebody and to help everybody who needs help. Russian society considers a person, who doesn`t keep these rules, as deficient, merciless, heartless and inhuman. At the same time aiding people who need help is realized with a glance of comparative estimation results, that supposes: 1) selection of persons who need help more than the others, 2) regulation the size of donation with means of a giving person. Etiquette requires showing tact the object of mercy and not to use the appreciation words (бедный, жалкий, убогий) in communication with such kind of people. Also you should not reproach them with it (попрекать куском хлеба). Any person has a right to complain of his bad living conditions (жаловаться, сетовать, роптать), but he has not to complain about unimportant departure from the norm of his life and to be too verbose or tiresome (ныть, хныкать, скулить). Russian etiquette also recommends to moderate undesirable impression of his complaint by apologies or selfirony. The person who is the cause of his own bad living conditions should not complain of these conditions and can only regret about it (пенять на себя самого). It is impermissible to complain of anybody in order to derive advantage from that (ябедничать, кляузничать, фискалить). It is quite appropriate to express regret for the loss of something valuable (жалеть о чем), but you should not show stinginess if its necessary to help people (жалеть чего-л. для кого-то). Mercy norm recommends not to attach importance to complaints of the person who violates these rules.",

Dans la pratique, les niveaux ou les montants sont extrêmement variés. Cet article revient sur cette multiplicité. Tous ces niveaux sont le résultat de choix : choix ou hypothèses retenues par les experts pour la fixation des seuils de pauvreté, choix sur la composition du panier de biens pour le calcul du niveau des dépenses normalisées ou budgets types et choix relatifs aux barèmes de minima sociaux comme le RMI. Les discours savants ou politiques justifient parfois ces choix, par exemple celui d'un seuil de pauvreté plutôt qu'un autre ou encore celui du barème d'un minimum social. Ces choix reflètent en fait des représentations de la pauvreté, forcément subjectives et relatives.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ideological attitudes supporting group‐based dominance (i.e., social dominance orientation, SDO) and in‐group authority (i.e., right‐wing authoritarianism, RWA) are well‐established dual antecedents of prejudice. We extend classic perspectives of prejudice as an attitudinal outcome by testing this dual‐antecedent model with prejudice operationalized as inclusive behavioral intentions in a nationally‐representative Australian community sample (N = 2,632). An exploratory structural equation model simultaneously derived three domains of behavioral intentions in the data: small, interpersonal gestures (e.g., saying hello to people from other groups), volunteering to help the disadvantaged (e.g., mentoring people from disadvantaged groups), and political action (e.g., organizing a demonstration). There was evidence for a dual‐motivational basis of inclusive behavior intentions, with SDO negatively predicting all three categories of behaviors, particularly interpersonal gestures, while RWA showed a small negative relation only with political action. The findings suggest that motivations for group‐based dominance are the primary barrier against behavioral intentions toward social inclusion, which can inform the design of public interventions for reducing prejudice and discrimination.",

      "abstract": "There is much more to late modernity than the comfort it has brought to our daily lives: this age of rapid and sometimes radical change in which we live has also rendered more complex the interactions between human beings. One example of this complexity is the bureaucratization of interpersonal relations, brought about by the expanding commercialization of services. Modern society all too often trivializes the contact between service providers and clients, and this has resulted in efforts to make direct contact between individuals and organizations more frequent. In past decades, high-quality relationships with customers were considered a key element of success in bureaucratic organizations (Dubar 2000: 113). Yet the focus on the customer has further problematized the question of communication in individual–organization interactions. The client's evaluation of the service is directly related to his/her expectations, which are invested with subjectivity. The success of the company's engagement in providing a service that will satisfy the client depends, therefore, on communication that favors a better reciprocal understanding and a shared sense of the actions of the participants (Zarifian 2001).",

      "abstract": "Çalışma ortamının görünmeyen risklerinden olan mobbing illetinin, basta aşırı bireyselleşme egoizm olmak üzere örgütsel toplumsal birçok nedeni bulunmaktadır. Rekabet merkezli küreselleşme koşullarında dünyada olduğu gibi ülkemizde de bütün çabalara rağmen git gide yaygınlaşmaktadır. Ülkemizde her ortamda şiddet tırmanmakla beraber özellikle psikolojik şiddet olayları daha ziyade sağlık, üniversite vb., iş güvencesi riskinin yüksek olduğu ortamlarda, daha çok görülmektedir. Bu gelişmelere paralel olarak toplumda mobbing mağduru kişi sayısının başta TBMM olmak üzere resmi ve gönüllü ilgili kuruluşlarında artış ve katılım trendi, &amp;nbsp;sorunun öneminin bir göstergesidir. O yüzden bu konu bildiri konusu seçilmiştir. Konuya dair bugüne kadar artan oranda yapılan araştırmalar göstermektedir ki özdenetimin, takım ruhunun gelişmediği, görev ve sorumlulukların net oluşmadığı kurumsallaşmanın yetersiz olduğu çalışma ortamlarında mobbing olgusu daha çok yaşanmaktadır.&amp;nbsp; Dolayısıyla psiko-şiddeti, örgüt kültürü ve ikliminden bağımsız düşünmek ya da tasarlamak olası değildir. Örgüt kültürü, örgüt üyeleri tarafından kabul edilen değerler ve normlar dizisi olarak düşünüldüğünde; sağlıklı bir değer ve norm serisi olan örgütlerde, psiko-şiddet gibi temel insan haklarını taciz eden etik dışı davranışlar engellenebilmektedir.&amp;nbsp; Bu nedenle örgütlerde psiko-şiddet eğilimliler, eğer örgüt bünyesinde tutunabileceklerini hissederlerse mobbing illeti bir virüs gibi örgüt içinde hızla yayılabilmektedir. Dolayısıyla bir an önce kaliteli yönetim için psikolojik şiddet riskine karşı çalışma ortamlarında farkındalık düzeyinin oluşturulması gerekir. Aksi takdirde gerekli önlemler alınmazsa sağlıksız otoriter nitelikteki liderlik yaklaşımlar ve tahripkâr hastalıklı birtakım tutum ve davranışlar yüzünden nitelikli iş gören ve kurumların maddi ve manevi çöküşüne fırsat tanınmış olunacaktır. Bu bakımdan kurumlarda mobbing ile mücadelede izlenecek yol haritamızda temel ölçü; liyakat, adalet vb. bilim merkezli bir yönetim anlayışının göz ardı edilmemesi olmalıdır. Nitekim marka üniversiteleri başarıya taşıyan unsurlara bakıldığında en çok, aile tipi liderlik güvenilir iletişim, empati ve yönetişim prensipleri sayesinde sinerjisi canlı tutulan kaliteli çalışma ortamları ön plana çıkmaktadır.",

We still valid the Therapeutic Community, understanding as methodology, however, not as residential care, but as specific professional intervention where, who suffers from a condition of existential suffering (whatever that is) and who work to care for, are not left alone but immersed in a relational network that passes through and transforms them. The exclusion from bank credit to the condition of poverty and/or precariousness causes, seems to affect tragically participatory and community processes; negatively influencing the community development.

      "abstract": "Social context, as mentioned in the Chapter 2 , has been given relatively little explicit consideration in personal construct theory (PCT) to date. There is a formal recognition of social relationships in terms of the sociality corollary of the theory, or to the extent that people interpret the construction processes of others they are able to play roles in social processes involving others (Kelly, 1955). This theoretical corollary has inspired an entire book to make sense of social processes, individuals, and related topics (see Bannister, 1979; Stringer, 1979), as well as numerous attempts (already mentioned) to sort out the social side of PCT. In addition, Kelly's commonality corollary—to the extent that one person employs a construction of experience similar to that employed by another person, their psychological processes can be seen as similar—seems to point to social factors to some extent. It remains unclear, however, what social processes and social context actually mean to individuals, self-identity, and especially to their understanding of sexuality. Additionally, the ontological status of various social factors is unresolved within the theory, which is odd and uncomfortable in a personality theory with clinical implications—social interaction and social conditions must be relevant, for example, to a psychotherapeutic encounter if only between two individuals. We feel the need here to consider the potential contributions to PCT, and especially a PCT-based understanding of sexuality, of sociology, social psychology (both psychological and sociological social psychology), and other social science disciplines.",

      "abstract": "Meaning construction and connectivity in e-merging contextsIndeed, our present societies are powerfully shaped by the presence (and/or absence) of online, self-paced development processes.We clearly keep building multi-cultural, multiideological information highways.By doing so, we are seemingly shaping our globe into a world of parallel systems of meaning (Toumi, 2004).In this multi-meaning universe, the emerging societies in different parts of our world are increasingly depending on international links and networks to live on: their communication activities become critically important in the social construction of communities that learn (Tuomi, 2004).In these emerging societies, our culture-led communication artefacts and culturally-based arrangements such as technologies, information systems and connection infrastructures are intending to make our communication activities more intense and more relevant to others.At the same time, access to meaningful communication (or the lack of it) is shaping our selfperceptions as individuals; and our perceptions about other humans, cultures, and value systems in many ways.Hence, our unconventional exchanges of information, knowledge and experiences over the Internet are becoming permanent and personal processes of meaning negotiation.Message significance depends on who and where are the users at the moment of interaction.This meaning negotiation is the new reality of e-learning environments and Internet-based interactions happening world-wide on a 24/7 basis: an increasing flow of continuous and creative interaction.",

      "title": "No good deed goes unpunished: the social costs of prosocial behaviour",
      "abstract": "Performing costly helpful behaviours can allow individuals to improve their reputation. Those who gain a good reputation are often preferred as interaction partners and are consequently better able to access support through cooperative relationships with others. However, investing in prosocial displays can sometimes yield social costs: excessively generous individuals risk losing their good reputation, and even being vilified, ostracised or antisocially punished. As a consequence, people frequently try to downplay their prosocial actions or hide them from others. In this review, we explore when and why investments in prosocial behaviour are likely to yield social costs. We propose two key features of interactions that make it more likely that generous individuals will incur social costs when: (a) observers infer that helpful behaviour is motivated by strategic or selfish motives; and (b) observers infer that helpful behaviour is detrimental to them. We describe how the cognition required to consider ulterior motives emerges over development and how these tendencies vary across cultures - and discuss how the potential for helpful actions to result in social costs might place boundaries on prosocial behaviour as well as limiting the contexts in which it might occur. We end by outlining the key avenues and priorities for future research.",

      "title": "Exit from and non take up of public services. A comparative analysis: France, Greece, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Hungary",
      "abstract": "Non-take-up of social rights, which in all countries consist of social benefits and services, is a serious cause for concern and a threat to social cohesion in Europe. Irrespective of whether NTU is explained in terms of unintentional behaviours (non-take-up) or deliberate ones (exit from), or in terms of institutional factors (public policies, territorial distribution of the public offer, administrative functioning, etc.), the very existence of this phenomenon is a fundamental challenge to the effectiveness, if not the validity, of the social welfare systems implemented throughout Europe, in some cases decades ago. The issue seems particularly urgent in light of the fact that in many countries the choice of policies and measures targeted more specifically at vulnerable groups – primarily via means-tested or even behaviour-tested benefits –, has not curbed this phenomenon. The fact that NTU has been recognized as a public problem either directly, with the emergence of “new poverty” in countries that have sound social welfare systems (here, the Netherlands, Germany and France), or indirectly, in new EU member countries (here, Greece, Spain and Hungary) through debates on the development of social protection and its opening up to minorities, does not fundamentally alter the problem. The reforms introduced to take into account priorities which change in tune with social demands and budgetary constraints simply highlight the difficulties of access to social rights. The emergence of NTU, presented in the first part of the report, does not seem to be curbed by measures which redefine rights to welfare benefits, introduce increasingly selective criteria for family allowances, or determine social minima (regarding income and health insurance); on the contrary. In particular, the conditions of access which have been introduced and which very often evolve, seem to be dissuasive to take-up in many respects. Statistical data drawn from a country-specific census and from surveys and studies focused directly or indirectly on NTU, all demonstrate the extent of the phenomenon, as shown at the beginning of the second part of the report. Starting with a critical examination of available knowledge for measuring and describing this NTU (which often calls into question administrative organisation), the report presents some operational devices set up to assess and address the problem. Since the initial objective of this report is to say what needs to be known in order to act, three basic recommendations have been put forward. It is necessary to: - first, encourage networks of actors to show an interest in the NTU issue in order to collectively produce shared information, with a view to monitoring the phenomenon; - second, support scientific research that is clearly focused on recording visible NTU at the level of NGO actors in close contact with the most disadvantaged groups, potentially the most exposed to NTU; - third, construct indicators of NTU based on “population indicators” established for the needs of particular professional activities and sometimes validated at international level (e.g. in the medical field), so that the many methodological difficulties related to comparison of heterogeneous data bases can be avoided. These recommendations may seem too modest but they are simply realistic. Considering the differing levels of recognition of the NTU phenomenon in the various countries, and the extreme disparity of available information, it seems entirely unrealistic to propose the construction of general indicators of NTU, valid at European level. Although NTU needs to be taken into account and measured in a systematic and comparable way, the diagnosis presented here clearly shows that we are still a long way from fulfilling the conditions in which NTU could be a factor of evaluation of the success of national and European policies to promote social inclusion.

To je se posebej motece v bližnjih življenjskih skupnostih, na primer v stanovanjskih blokih pod režimom etažne lastnine, kjer zaradi množice razlicnih dejavnikov (bližine stanovanjskih enot, deljenja uporabe skupnih delov stavbe, nenehne bližine sostanovalcev, delne izgube zasebnosti) praviloma prevladujejo strožja pravila kot v tipicnih ruralnih predelih Republike Slovenije. Eno izmed teh omogoca vložitev izkljucitvene tožbe, s katero je mogoce etažnemu lastniku zaradi njegovega prekomerno nadutega odnosa odvzeti lastninsko pravico, ki jo ima na posameznem delu izoblikovanega etažnega režima. \r\n\r\nDiplomsko delo se uvodoma dotakne razvoja etažne lastnine vse do njene danasnje forme, nato pa poglobljeno razcleni zakonsko besedilo instituta izkljucitvene tožbe.

      "title": "Social Theatre. Brief Phenomenology of a Plural, Polycentric and Participatory Performativity",
      "abstract": "In the Beginning\"Social theatre\" might sound like a tautology, since all \"theatre\" is \"social\" insofar as it is the art of bodies entering into a space-time relationship.The fact that the expression social theatre has been present in Italy since the end of the 1990s and been given a new meaning (Bernardi, 1998) shows that the word theatre alone was perceived as insufficient to identify that set of participatory performance experiences, which, since the 1970s, had become increasingly widespread not only in practice, but also in national and international studies and awards, fully inscribing social theatre within the broader framework of applied performance (Thompson and Schechner, 2004; Jackson, 2007).Social theatre is a phenomenon with many roots and different legacies.It is no doubt the child of the cultural revolution, the political and social movements, the artistic and theatrical avant-garde movements that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s (Bernardi, 2004; Schininà, 2004; Valenti, 2004; Garavaglia, 2014).Among the innovations that most impacted on its formulation, there are most certainly social animation, Animazione teatrale 10 and the Grotowskian experience of the workshop.It is in this environment that a number of experiences took shape in the early 1980s, representing the \"karst\" phase of social theatre, during a period of theatrical restoration which saw the failure of a large number of those revolutionary drives.The ensuing triumph of neoliberalism and advent of globalisation led to the dissociation between art and society.Social issues became social services, political parties and movements collapsed taking with them the participation of citizens in the construction of the public good and in the fight against inequality.It was precisely from the social problems of marginalisation, emigration, addiction, exclusion, illness and discomfort that in the 1990s the demand to put art once again at the core of society emerged, as people began to take responsibility for their own progress, their own realisation and their own care.10 For an explanation of the meaning of Animazione teatrale see the Notes on Translations on p. 7. The expression is used in this sense throughout the paper.",

Intergroup relations has a high profile in social psychology because society is organized into groups that need to be able to get on with one another; and yet intergroup perceptions and behavior are generally ethnocentric and competitive, and have a notable tendency to degenerate into stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and destructive conflict. conflictual intergroup relations are a significant problem for society (see Chapter 12, this volume). The challenge for society is to be able to manage intergroup relations such that the enormous social promise of intergroup cooperation can be fulfilled.",

      "abstract": "Busing of children to achieve racial balance in schools is an important and controversial social issue. In studying the school busing problem, various groups (e.g., operations researchers, educators, sociologists, psychologists) proceed quite differently because of their different “Weltanschauungen”—their different perceptions of reality, their different world views. Operations researchers have viewed the school busing problem as a desegregation problem (i.e., simply physically mixing the races) while others have seen it as an integration problem (i.e., helping to bring about a viable, multi-racial society). The usefulness of the desegregation view of operations researchers is evaluated in light of findings from the educational literature about various aspects of the school busing problem. Explicit attention by operations researchers to the concept of “Weltanschauung” should result in studies more useful to school officials and administrators. Statements made about the role of “Weltanschauung” in operations research studies of the school busing problem may be applied to operations research studies in other areas of social concern such as health, welfare, and law enforcement.",

      "title": "The complementation of the stereotype embodiment theory",
      "abstract": "Elderly people are unique among various discriminated social groups (e.g., black, LGBT) because we all, sooner or later, come to be seen with the negative stereotype. People internalize the negative age stereotype (e.g., incompetent, out-of-date) through life, which has undesirable effects on themselves when they get older. We give an overview of the Stereotype Embodiment Theory (SET; Levy, 2009), consisting of four processes: internalization, unconscious operation, salience gain from self-relevance, and utilization of multiple pathways. The SET discusses the process of generating age stereotype through life, internalizing the stereotype, and the impact toward self. The theory helps to explain the process of elderly adults’ self-stereotyping but the SET cannot fully explain an empirically known tendency—a mixed finding that elderly people try to separate themselves from other elderly adults while they are also heavily influenced by negative age stereotypes (e.g., showing a decline in the score of memory tasks). To complement the SET, we introduce the Social Identity Theory (SIT; Tajfel, 1981), which is often used to show the process of generating stereotype among various social groups. By attributing the elderly’s identity to the younger age group, elderly people aim to detach themselves from other people of about the same age. Meanwhile, they face lots of social requests from other generations (e.g., “Elderly adults should not accumulate wealth, but pass it on to the next generation.”) and many opportunities to recognize that they are “the elderly,” which force them to attribute their identity to “the elderly group” appropriate for age. This process makes elderly adults to acquire the self-relevance to the negative age stereotype. The SET itself and the complementation of the theory help to discuss how to decrease undesirable effects of self-stereotyping on elderly people. Although there are some unresolved problems, this study provides a guideline for the literature.",

Como muestran los artículos, estos silencios están presentes en la investigación y en la práctica de la profesión y el relevamiento realizado por los autores nos interpela a reflexionar sobre ellos. Cuando en la comunicación organizacional y las relaciones públicas se evitan o excluyen temas complejos o críticos, aun cuando sean de alto impacto social, ¿se hace por los intereses de las organizaciones, por el desconocimiento de los profesionales, por temor? Las diversidades raciales y de género, el diálogo con las personas vulnerables, la inclusión de personas con discapacidades parece estar menos presente en la agenda profesional de lo que se presenta en el discurso corporativo. Un destaque especial entre las poblaciones invisibilizadas son los trabajadores de las mismas organizaciones. A pesar de ser un grupo de interés clave en cualquier estrategia organizacional no siempre se lo incluye en la comunicación y en ocasiones se desconocen sus necesidades e identidades.",

One of the principal causes of this situation is that those who ask for social work intervention are not sufficiently involved in working out their own problems.

Though patient engagement conceptually begins to disrupt the identity of \"researcher,\" and complicate our assumptions and understandings around expertise and knowledge, it continues to essentialize the identity of \"patient\" as a homogenous group, denying the reality that individuals' economic, political, cultural, subjective and experiential lives intersect in intricate and multifarious ways. Patient engagement approaches that do not consider the simultaneous interactions between different social categories (e.g. race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, gender, class, sexuality, geography, age, ability, immigration status, religion) that make up social identity, as well as the impact of systems and processes of oppression and domination (e.g. racism, colonialism, classism, sexism, ableism, homophobia) exclude the involvement of individuals who often carry the greatest burden of illness — the very voices traditionally less heard in health research. We contend that in order to be a more inclusive and meaningful approach that does not simply reiterate existing health inequities, it is important to reconceptualize patient engagement through a health equity and social justice lens by incorporating a trauma-informed intersectional analysis. This article provides key concepts to the incorporation of a trauma-informed intersectional analysis and important questions to consider when developing a patient engagement strategy in health research training, practice and evaluation. In redefining the identity of both \"patient\" and \"researcher,\" spaces and opportunities to resist and renegotiate power within the intersubjective relations can be recognized and addressed, in turn helping to build trust, transparency and resiliency — integral to the advancement of the science of patient engagement in health research.",

It is undeniable that the disputes that arise will damage the ties of brotherhood and even damage the good relations between neighbors that should be well established. Because one or more people feel that they are in conflict, it can destroy and damage the peace in social life. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to find out how far the community knows the causes of the dilemmas that occur between neighbors and the community and minimize the occurrence of dilemmas and disputes between neighbors. If they can’t minimize their awareness, at least the public can understand the impact and dangers that can arise from dilemmas and disputes, because basically when humans understand something good (even though it’s hard to practice) they only need one more step to be moved and intend to do it.",

This heritage contains conflicts. For example, in a recent discussion about the purposes and management of groups in intermediate treatment schemes, the social workers who participated disagreed heatedly, and it became clear that two basic ideologies were in conflict: the first was that the major guiding value of such groups of young people in trouble should be to offer treatment or therapy in an attempt to change delinquent behaviour; and the second was that they should attempt to develop social consciousness and an awareness of the nature of the deprivation suffered by the members. A decision on that question would naturally lead to very different arrangements by the worker, from the act of composing the group to the manner and timing of terminating it.",

      "abstract": "Everyday joint remembering, from family remembering around the dinner table to team remembering in the operating theatre, relies on the successful interweaving of multiple cognitive, bodily, social and material resources, anchored in specific cultural ecosystems. Such systems for joint remembering in social interactions are composed of processes unfolding over multiple but complementary timescales, which we distinguish for analytic purposes so as better to study their interanimation in practice: (i) faster, lower-level coordination processes of behavioral matching and interactional synchrony occurring at timescale t 1 ; (ii) mid-range collaborative processes which re-evoke past experiences in groups, unfolding at timescale t 2 ; (iii) cooperative processes involved in the transmission of memories over longer periods occurring at timescale t 3 ; and (iv) cultural processes and practices operating within distributed socio-cognitive networks over evolutionary and historical timeframes, unfolding at timescale t 4 . In this paper we survey studies of how the processes operating across these overlapping and complementary timescales constitute joint remembering in social interactions. We describe coordination, collaboration, cooperation, and culture as complementary aspects of interacting to remember, which we consider as a complex phenomenon unfolding over multiple timescales (t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , t 4 ).",

Membership in a nation state denotes both civic belonging in the political community and cultural belonging in the national community. In the political community all citizens are seen as equal. However, evidence points to the continued disadvantage, social exclusion and marginalisation which characterise Australian society. Current and past policies, programs and ideas on social exclusion have focused on exclusion from the labour market, economic exclusion (including poverty), exclusion based on social isolation, geographic or spatial exclusion, and exclusion based on institutional processes and systems. In the considerations of social exclusion/inclusion, very little attention has been paid to exclusion based on culture, ethnicity, racism and other diversity signifiers as causal factors of disadvantage. Recent social inclusion debates in Australia have not resulted in any meaningful consideration of cultural diversity as a force for inclusion or exclusion. Furthermore, the nation state has been actively engaged in the construction of Australian in particular ways that have denied the consideration of ethnic identity as a positive feature of nation building. Through the use of fear, law and order, and a neo-liberal approach, the Australian state has constructed an environment which has depleted a sense of belonging for minorities. In so doing, it has depleted social capital in communities and social cohesion across the nation. This chapter explores the concepts of and belonging for minority communities in the context of globalisation and the nation state in Australia.",

      "title": "Role of effective communication to ensure community participation in NGOs' projects: A comparative study of a Malaysian and a Pakistani NGO / Mumtaz Ali",
      "abstract": "In today‟s world social issues can be seen in the form of conflict, discrimination, poverty, low quality human resources and unequal distribution of resources, thereby leaving communities marginalized and deprived. Community development is one way of building the capacity of people and involving them in finding the solutions to such problems. Community development also has much potential to build community cohesion by facilitating and supporting a community‟s commitment and strengthening connections among individuals, organizations and local groups.\r\nCommunity participation in development projects is important and vital for the success of any initiative. To have a successful outcome, effective participation is important. Information and knowledge sharing among people can be attained through effective communication.\r\nPreviously, the management of non-governmental organizations was seen as esoteric and irrelevant but now-a-days there is much greater interest to do this management efficiently and effectively. There are various NGOs in Malaysia and Pakistan which can be sub-categorized as welfare and charity, health care and medical, youth and sports etc. Effective communication within such NGOs is essential to run development projects successfully. The five-rung ladder of participation by Wilcox (1994) relates to the stance that an organization may take for promoting participation- information sharing, consultation, deciding together, acting together and supporting independent community interests.\r\nThis study examines this flow of communication in one Malaysian and one Pakistani NGO (FRHAM from Malaysia and HANDS from Pakistan). The researcher has described and\r\nanalyzed how bottom up and the top down approaches are put into practice in these two NGOs. These NGOs need to determine how important the level of communication adaptation works in their respective contexts.\r\nThe data collected from these NGOs is analyzed based on the theory of Wilcox (1994) and the theory by Weick (1969). Questionnaires were used and interviews were conducted to obtain the data from 10 officials of each NGO (n= 10+10 = 20) and 200 members of the community (n= 100 + 100 = 200) of the respective NGOs. Interviews were conducted with five key informants from each country (n=5+5=10). Statistical analysis was conducted using the quantitative data and qualitative analysis was made based on the interviews with key informants.\r\nThe findings show a lack of a communication protocol with communities. This research added value to the body of existing knowledge by extending clarity on the subject for the purpose of the adaption and standardization of the communication system of NGOs. The data showed that the communication system of NGOs is an important factor to ensure community participation. A proper community participation mechanism needs to be implemented. The study results in a model named „Communication, Participation and Cooperation (CPC)‟ which is a way forward towards community empowerment.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the problem of bullying that is today encountered literally everywhere: at school, at work and on the Internet. Recently it has become a social and psychological problem that needs to be addressed both at the level of psychology and at the level of normative regulation and the introduction of appropriate communication practices in enterprises. Many researchers call bullying a social disease of the 21st century. Bullying is a kind of self-assertion of people at the expense of humiliation of others, harassment of one or more employees in the labor collective. However, such self-assertion brings unpleasant consequences – in terms of both labor management and psychological health of the victims. The problem of bullying is very common, however, it should be noted that its manifestation could vary significantly depending on the company, region and, more importantly, the country as a whole. It depends on culture, mentality and other factors. The authors consider several types of bullying practices and provide a comparative analysis of workplace bullying, based on statistical data describing the situation in Germany, the USA and Russia. Each country has its own characteristics and conditions for the formation of reasons for bullying, and its own mechanisms for solving this problem.",

This 'coming together' usually emerges organically- people find one another within their existing networks, or it can happen purposefully - someone such as a community worker, leader or activist enables it to happen through networking and inviting people to come together. In this process of coming together people discover the possibilities and potentials of cooperation. People learn or realise that what they could not do or make sense of alone, they can do as a group. Within community development methodology a key part of this process is the shift from what is sometimes understood as 'I' to 'We'. lt is a critical shift, a significant movement.

      "title": "Economic development, place-based development strategies and the conceptualization of proximity in European urban regions",
      "abstract": "The discussion on proximity has evolved in various theoretical, conceptual and empirical directions since the seminal contributions by Torre and Rallet (2005) and Boschma (2005). One of the main arguments for conceptualizing proximities other than physical proximities is embedded in the ever-growing importance of knowledge over other production factors of organizations and entrepreneurs. Knowledge is acquired through the interactive process of learning, based on the cognitive competencies and experiences of actors. A distinction can be made between 'tacit' and 'codified' knowledge. Tacit knowledge can be defined as the person-specific knowledge that people have developed through a process of learning-by-doing or learning-by-using, meaning that a person is able to use it but is not, or is not yet, able to codify it in a transferable form, such as a book, patent or a mathematical formula. These kinds of knowledge are not fixed. Tacit knowledge and codified knowledge have to be perceived as dynamic attributes that can be transformed into one other. After a period of application, tacit knowledge can be codified and, vice versa; sometimes, codified knowledge can be developed further and can become tied to individuals. The ways in which learning and the transfer of knowledge across organizations in spatial settings can be investigated and measured, has triggered much debate and research (Van Oort and Lambooy, 2013). As tacit knowledge is most productively transferred face-to-face, physical proximity of organizations, entrepreneurs, subcontractors and customers is often required.",

However, agency can also be situated within the realm of self-interest where difference is individually measured and achieved; this being seen as some worse forms of new individualism defining living in the 21st Century (Elliott & du Gay, 2009). What is not as well understood is that agency also exits in relation to others with social bonds being a powerful way of knowing ourselves and attributing meaning.",

      "abstract": "This article describes the major changes undergone by social dialogue in the 1990s. Two distinct periods are covered. The first, following in the wake of the Maastricht Social Agreement annexed to the Maastricht Treaty (1992), did not produce the expected new impetus and results. The novel institutional device of ‘collective bargaining in the shadow of the law’, though an advantage in some respects, was also a source of weakness for the social dialogue. The most striking feature of the second period, covering the later part of the 1990s, is the impressive diversification of institutional forms of social dialogue, a development that ought to multiply its chances of success, even if the new forms tend to be rather less ambitious. Four main new developments are described: • Diversification of the forums for discussion; • Increase in the number and type of topics covered; • Use of OMC tools in the context of the social dialogue; • Search for new ways of establishing connections between different forms and levels of social dialogue. Whether this proliferation of ‘entry points’, arenas and discussion topics will serve to strengthen the actors and improve the results of the European social dialogue remains an open question.",

      "abstract": "Some events are drivers for a change in the way we live life. When these events are not controllable, as has been the case with the coronavirus pandemic, everything is precipitated and the mechanisms of change are accelerated regardless of the type of culture, society, or economy in which they take place. Possibly it is the circumstances that directly affect the health of the population that are the most critical and are the ones that cause the greatest concern and change.&#x0D; This is the first time in history that we have had the opportunity to study lockdown behavior at a global level, analyzing how it affects citizens’ way of life. The most widespread restrictions in most countries of the world have revolved around increasing physical distance, lockdowns (total, by districts, or by specific areas), curfews (variable depending on the severity of the situation of each place), mandatory isolation in the case of testing positive for the infection, the suppression of all kinds of activities (cultural, sports, leisure), and the promotion of remote working to avoid, as much as possible, being in contact with others.&#x0D; The two main characteristics of mandatory isolation are, on the one hand, complete physical isolation from family and friends and, on the other, the absolute restriction of free movement. Both measures, also being combined with other factors, can generate significant changes in the levels of anxiety and stress of confined people. This is due to these people experiencing emotions of fear regarding illness and death, the possible loss of their jobs, the consequent economic problems, and the probability of increasing their level of being sedentary as a result of not being able to go outside to exercise.&#x0D; In this study, we propose, from a theoretical point of view, the precedents and consequences of lockdown behavior regarding the dimensions that we consider fundamental in people's lives. We analyze how lockdown influences lifestyle, from eating habits to sleeping patterns, digital behavior, physical activity, and emotional state, reaching the theoretical conclusion that all of these aspects can be significantly altered.",

      "title": "Consensus models for large-scale group decision making with different types of preference relations",
      "abstract": "Group decision making refers to the process in which two or more decision makers (DMs) or experts participate in the decision-making, and choose a common solution from the given alternatives [Kac86]. Nowadays, with the rapid development of social economy and information technology, the decision environment and groups have undergone significant changes. The scale of the groups involved in decision-making has gradually expanded, and the decision-making problems have become increasingly complex. Consequently, large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) problems have attracted widely attention recently [PMH14, QPM15, XWZ18].\n In LSGDM issues, preference relation is one of the most usual preference structures to be used in expressing DMs’ assessment information, because it is a useful tool in modeling decision processes [HHVC01]. In LSGDM problems, different DMs generally have different culture, education backgrounds or personal interest preferences. Also, there are fuzziness and hesitancy natures in human judgment. When expressing their assessment information, DMs may have several possible numerical values and may perform hesitance to give the decisions. To deal with the DMs’ fuzziness and hesitancy in the decision-making processes, hesitant fuzzy preference relation (HFPR) was proposed in [ZXX17]. In HFPR, DM’s assessment information consists of hesitant fuzzy elements, which denote all possible preference values and can be utilized to effectively express DM’s hesitant and fuzzy information in LSGDM problems. Additionally, real LSGDM cases involve not only the calculation of mathematical models, but also the psychological behavior of DMs [DLL+17]. Self-confidence is a person’s psychological implication of self-statement, and can reflect one’s knowledge, experience or attitude in the LSGDM processes. Besides, DMs’ self-confidence is a factor affecting human decision making which has been proven in many researches [Hin90, JT67]. Recently, a new type of preference relations, i.e., self-confident fuzzy preference relations (SC-FPRs) was introduced by [LDC+17]. In an SC-FPR, the elements are composed of two components, the former represents the preference degree between pairs of alternatives, and the latter denotes the self-confidence level associated with the first component, as a psychological expression for personal self-estimation.\n Generally, in real LSGDM problems, it is really hard to ensure the final decision(s) can be accepted by all the DMs since there are a large number of DMs participated. Hence, the consensus reaching processes (CRPs) were proposed to improve the efficiency of LSGDM problems [PMH14]. The CRPs aim to reduce the objections of the minority while pursuing the agreements of the majority and have become one of the main concerns in the LSGDM issues. Up to now, different consensus models have been proposed and made a considerable progress in LSGDM research [GXH18, WX18, DZZ+18]. However, the LSGDM that considers the DMs’ hesitancy and fuzziness still need to be further discussed. Moreover, LSGDM research that considers the multiple self-confidence of DMs remains a challenge.\n To further enrich and improve the consensus research of LSGDM problems, This thesis focuses on the following three aspects of discussions.\n Firstly, we mainly focus on the CRPs for hesitant fuzzy LSGDM problems. That is, DMs use HFPRs to express their assessment information, which can well represent the fuzziness and hesitancy of DM’s assessment information. To improve the efficiency of hesitant fuzzy LSGDM problems, we first propose a reliability index-based consensus reaching process (RI-CRP). By assessing the ordinal consistency of DM’s assessment information and measuring the deviation from collective opinion, the opinion reliability index of DM is given. To avoid unreliable information, we propose an unreliable DM management method to be used in the RI-CRP, based on the computation of DM’s opinion reliability index. An alternative ranking-based clustering (ARC) method with HFPRs is proposed to improve the efficiency of the RI-CRP. The similarity index between two DMs’ opinions is provided to ensure the ARC method can be effectively implemented. In the RI-CRP, a group consensus index (GCI) is given to measure the consensus level. To achieve a high level of consensus, the management processes for non cooperative clusters in the RI-CRP are proposed.\n Secondly, considering the application of the new type of preference relations SC-FPRs in group decision making, we first give some operational laws for SC-FPRs. Subsequently, to improve the reliability of DMs’ assessment information, we make an additive consistency analysis on SCFPRs. An additive consistency index which considers the DMs’ self-confidence is presented to measure the consistency level of an SC-FPR. Moreover, an self-confidence driven consistency improvement algorithm is proposed to repair the inconsistency of SC-FPRs. Besides, we propose a novel self-confidence indices-based induced ordered weighted averaging (SCI-IOWA) operator for group decision making with SC-FPRs. A self-confidence score (SCS) function is designed to obtain the best alternative in group decision making with SC-FPRs. To further demonstrate the advantages of applying the SC-FPRs in group decision making problems, we deeply explored the consensus process in the social network environment based on SC-FPRs. A dynamic importance degree of DMs which combines the external trust and internal self-confidence is proposed to determine their weights. A novel GCI considering self-confidence is defined to assess the consensus level among DMs under the social network decision making situation. Meanwhile, a trust-based feedback mechanism is presented to improve the consensus efficiency.\n Finally, based on the discussion of the operational laws and consistency analysis for SC-FPRs, we further deeply discuss the impact of DMs’ self-confidence on LSGDM, and analyze the CRPs in LSGDM with SC-FPRs. A new DMs clustering algorithm that considers DMs’ self-confidence is presented to improve the consensus efficiency. A GCI that considers DMs’ self-confidence is developed to measure the consensus level of the LSGDM with SC-FPRs. Meanwhile, a measure of overconfidence degree is introduced to estimate the contribution of the DM’s self-confidence to the collective consensus. Based on the overconfidence degree, the detailed overconfidence behavior detection and management is developed.\n Overall, this thesis mainly focuses on the consensus models for LSGDM with different types of preference relations. The first one of this research is the consistency model for LSGDM based on HFPRs. And the second one is the CRPs for LSGDM with SC-FPRs.\n The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Section 2 provides some related preliminaries used throughout this contribution. In Section 3, the basic ideas and the challenges that justify the development of this thesis are discussed. Section 4 proposes the objective of this thesis. Section 5 presents the methodology used in the thesis. A summary of the consensus models for LSGDM with different types of preference relations are presented in Section 6. Section 7 presents a discussion of the results obtained in the thesis. Finally, Section 8 draws the conclusion of this thesis and in Section 9 the future works are discussed.",

      "abstract": "La colaboracion organizativa efectiva raramente brota de los acuerdos oficiales, la mayoria de los cuales, una vez firmados, esperan olvidados en un polvoriento archivo. En su lugar, tales relaciones surgen de una multiplicidad de interacciones y esfuerzos a diferentes niveles, pero en su nucleo basadas en contactos continuados entre el personal profesional y operativo. Los acuerdos formales, aunque utiles para legitimar y validar estos contactos, no los sustituyen. E consecuencia, cualquier propuesta para promover las relaciones a largo plazo requiere una construccion cuidadosa y el apoyo a interacciones continuas que buscan asegurar la viabilidad de proyectos concretos. Una aproximacion para comprender como funciona este proceso en practica consiste en estudiar el surgimiento de relaciones productivas como aquellas existentes entre los sitios Patrimonio Mundial de la Zona Arqueologica de Monte Alban en Oaxaca, Mexico y (A) el Parque Nacional de Mesa Verde en Colorado, Estados Unidos de America, y (B) Uxmal en Yucatan, Mexico. La comparacion de la experiencia de crear colaboraciones a nivel nacional e internacional proporciona elementos que pueden entonces ser utilizados para disenar otras redes o mas extensas. Este trabajo busca (1) revisar los origenes y exitos de la Sister Parks Initiative, (2) identificar los obstaculos que deben ser resueltos por el personal de la agencia en su dia a dia si se desean alcanzar los objetivos establecidos por sus instituciones respectivas y (3) reconocer los obstaculos potenciales para la sostenibilidad, particularmente aquellos obstaculos relacionados con la gestion institucional a lo largo del tiempo. Desde la experiencia compartida de estos tres lugares esperamos clarificar posibles consideraciones estrategicas para determinar las posibilidades de un exito continuo. Dos agencias gubernamentales con responsabilidades en el campo de la gestion de los recursos patrimoniales…el Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH-Mexico) y el National Park Service (NPS- EEUU)…son actores centrales en esta evaluacion. Las fuentes de informacion abarcan desde documentos oficiales hasta la participacion en actividades principales de las dos agencias en relacion con los sitios bajo consideracion.

      "title": "Informality and Marginalised Groups in Crisis Response",
      "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic had ripple effects that extend beyond the domain of health risks into economic, social, and political domains. These effects were not evenly distributed and exacerbated existing societal inequalities and marginalisation (UNDRR and UNU-EHS 2022: 11). Informal and migrant workers, and those living in informal settlements, were disproportionately affected by the health and secondary impacts of the pandemic, which further impacted their livelihoods and ability to meet basic needs, and constrained their ability to recover given the coping mechanisms they had to adopt (Chen et al. 2022: 19). At the same time, successful disaster risk reduction (DRR) often depends on informal actors and networks (Boersma et al. 2019). Limitations of formal disaster governance mechanisms have been much discussed, with shortcomings being largely connected to the lack of (local) knowledge, contextual understanding, incentives, coordination mechanisms, or flexibility, as well as focusing on infrastructural and technocratic solutions over engaging with existing local resources (Duda , Kelman and Glick 2020: 375). Despite this, short-term, single-hazard disaster management approaches still dominate (Donoghoe et al. 2022). Research supported by the Covid-19 Responses for Equity (CORE) Programme – which is supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) – points to the need for special provisions addressing current and future challenges of informal workers in disaster response (Pillai et al. 2022b). This requires not only including informal workers in Covid-19 recovery policies, but also centring them in economic, social, and disaster policy (Alfers et al. 2022). Certain actions need to be prioritised, including the need for better data, a rethinking of policies to ensure they encompass gender considerations and social protection measures that are inclusive of informal and migrant workers, and greater recognition of the important role that grass-roots organisations play in supporting marginalised groups in times of crisis.",

      "title": "Resiliency Networks: Bridging Multiple Worlds of Military-Connected Adolescents in Civilian Schools",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Black, Alison Michelle | Advisor(s): Wishard Guerra, Alison | Abstract: A majority of the nation’s military-connected dependents attend civilian public schools, yet there are pervasive inconsistencies in support programs and policies across schools (De Pedro, Astor, Gilreath, Benbenishty, a Esqueda, 2013). High mobility rates present several challenges to children of military Service members, such as learning gaps, social and emotional difficulties, and challenges forming relationships with peers and school personnel (Astor, Jacobson, a Benbenishty, 2012). This study examined how military-connected adolescents bridged their multiple military and civilian worlds in the school context. The theoretical foundations of the study included the Bridging Multiple Worlds (BMW) (Cooper, 2014) model and Social Network theory. The BMW design investigated military-connected adolescents’ perceived challenges and strengths of belonging to a military cultural community along with how they accessed resources for overcoming those challenges. Social Capital and Social Network theory situated developmental processes in a socialized context highlighting how interpersonal relationships shape development (Bourdieu, 1986; Daly, Moolenaar, Bolivar, a Burke, 2010). Focus groups revealed participants faced many of the typical challenges facing military-connected youth. They also perceived many of those challenges as having promoted positive developmental outcomes: social skills, resilience, and adaptability. Social networks, friendship networks and support networks, played an important role in overcoming the challenges of navigating their military and civilian worlds. Findings indicated differences in academic outcomes (GPA) between military and civilian participants, as well as between enlisted and officer participants. Findings also indicated different social network patterns between enlisted participants and officer participants. The rich history of military support within the local community and school environment may have influenced how military participants integrated into the whole eighth-grade friendship network. This study sought to fill the research gap by accurately representing the social and educational needs and circumstances of military-connected adolescents in a military-dense civilian middle school and to help educators create highly supportive environments for military-connected adolescents in civilian schools.",

      "abstract": "In general terms, academic literature on social capital builds on the empirical evidence that economic variables are not sufficient to bring about local development models that are socially just and environmentally sustainable; it is almost consensual in reaffirming that civic engagement networks, norms of mutual trust, resources stemming from social networks, the wealth of associative tissues and political institutions do have a direct impact when it comes to a qualitative increase on the communication between individuals and social actors, the production of more intensive modalities of social interaction, and the reduction of collective action dilemmas around local development strategies. It goes without saying that one of the critical elements of the current debate on the relationships between social capital and local development concerns the local development concept itself. Therefore, in this article, rooted in a definition of local development formulated by himself, the author has two main goals: (1) to analyze the conceptual dispute that reigns within the academia around the definition of social capital; (2) to argue that metaphors can be a valuable tool in better understanding the multiple roles that social capital may play in different contexts of local development. In the conclusion, based on his own research experience in the municipality of Pintadas in Bahia, between 2003 and 2005, the author sketches theoretical and methodological parameters in order to understand the relationships between social capital and local development.",

At the grassroots level,our history is capable of providing two modes of experience: social bonds based on the original ancestral and geopolitical characteristics;social bonds based on collective production and distribution.The former experience is of considerably strong features of partial and split organization,whose personal relationships based on levels of interpersonal intimacy has difficulty in functioning in the public society;the latter experience shows passive connection,hindering the establishment of active identity and belonging based on autonomous choices made by members of the society.Therefore,although the job of social integration is done at the grassroots level,the reasons lie in the field of macro-structure.It appears to resort to the managerial philosophy,yet in essence it is searching for shared interests of members of the society and the coordination mechanism of values.The key to the issue is the building of public system.This mechanism relies on the selective identification of the people.If traditional experience is not required to face public choice,it is difficult to provide ready-made models for integration issues in today's heterogeneous society.",

      "title": "DOING POLITICS, DOING GENDER, DOING POWER",
      "abstract": "Political communication is not first and foremost about truth; it is a struggle for power and influence between different interests. In this struggle, it is critical for politicians to persuade voters, and not just by the power of their argument, but also, and increasingly, through creating trust by means of their personality. In this study we will focus on how politicians attend to these concerns in televised election campaign debates in the Nordic countries. Ideally, political debates provide politicians with equal opportunities for airing their positions. This linguistic ideal of fairness has more elaborate equivalents in established theories of discourse, such as the theory of the ideal speech situation proposed by Habermas (1975a, b), Paul Grice’s maxims for efficient and logical communication (Grice, 1975), and the face-saving traffic rules of social interaction analyzed by Goffman (1967). However, this rudimentary standard of fairness is rarely satisfied in practice (Gastil, 1992). Rather than granting all participants equality, debates often become events in which prior inequalities, such as gender, age, class and status, are re-enacted (Edelsky & Adams, 1990). The question we are pursuing in this article is whether and how such “brought along” features are made relevant, or “brought about” in actual debate situations.",

Some of the major theories relevant to persuasion are, there fore, presented to provide a universal frame of reference ac cording to which the act of persuasion can be examined, ana lyzed, and discussed. On the other hand, latent criteria used in making evaluative judgments may vary from one individual to another and, to a greater extent, from one culture to another. Hence there are basic difficulties in cross-cultural communica tion. To overcome these difficulties, a three-step strategy of cross-cultural communication is proposed, which involves (1) a comprehensive—that is, both quantitative and qualitative— analysis of attitude components present in a target population, (2) systematic use of a multi-channel, multi-step flow of com munication, and (3) an application of C. E. Osgood's \"GRIT\" strategy for intercultural persuasion, in which communication is more by deeds than by words.",

Such a definition raises a number of questions, including how to distinguish different cultural groups and what interaction entails. Traditionally nationality or ethnicity has been taken as the criterion for distinguishing cultural groups, but in fact the situation is much more complex than this. We are all members of multiple different cultural groups (e.g., professional, organizational, religious), each of which can be said to have its own culture in terms of values, norms, and patterns of behavior. So what then counts as “intercultural” interaction?",

Drawing from life history theory, the current research explored whether individuals' early-life experiences are associated with narrow/deep (depth), or broad/shallow (breadth) approach to social relationships. Three studies revealed that participants' childhood socioeconomic status (SES) interacts with perception of economic instability to create diverging preferences in social relationship pattern. Specifically, when economic instability was salient (chronic belief, Study 1; experimentally primed, Studies 2 and 3), individuals from lower-SES childhood preferred a narrower and deeper social network, whereas those from higher-SES childhood preferred a broader and shallower network. Taken together, the present research offers a novel understanding of depth- versus breadth-focused approach to social relationships from the perspective of life history theory.",

Here it is viewed as a process of planned institutional change to bring about a better fit between human needs and social policies and programmes (Sanders, 1982); it is not satisfactory to measure development in purely economic terms, for this has resulted in the marginalization of the majority of the population in developing countries. The curative and remedial functions adopted by the social work profession in accordance with the dictates of the modernization approach, have rendered social work unable to address itself meaningfully to the problem of marginalization or mass poverty. Social development rests upon social policies that are promotive of human needs and this is only possible in circumstances where such policies are a product of the people's participation.",

Viewed as quasi-formal rules that can “instruct strangers and convey to children” how to behave in specific situations from a particular groups’ perspective – norms are models of (situationally) correct behaviors that ostensibly afford some benefit to the referent group (Brown, 1995) and are found in virtually all human societies (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989). Norms, as opposed to laws, are often unwritten and generally do not emerge through an explicit democratic or other formal governing mechanisms. When interpreted as guiding standard rules of behavior within an organization, norms influence much of organizational decision making (March 1996). Furthermore, we assert that norms not only can be components of routines, but routines themselves; however, this norms as routines assertion is nonsymmetric. Norms can be viewed as routines, but not all routines can be viewed as norms, thus leaving an interesting relation on the table: some routines can be viewed as norms. It is that residual class in which we address our work – routines as norms – routines that serve the function of norms in an organizational setting.",

      "abstract": "As one of the key concepts of conflict resolution, social tension characterizes a situation in which is clearly expressed (in the formation and dynamic development) of contradictions in interests and actions of people, social groups or institutions, or society as a whole. An integral part of this process is the increased opposition of the different actors in social interaction (of individuals and social groups), accompanied by increased discontent, de stabilization of social ties, and psychological tension. To successfully manage the dynamics of the society is to systematically obtain information on the status of its systems, and, in the context of the studied problems, it is important to regularly measure social tension for efficient prediction, prevention from the explosion of social tensions or conflicts, and finding optimal solutions. All this necessitates the development of theoretical-methodological and methodical bases of monitoring of social tension in social organizations at various levels that is tracking system exploring the state of the social process of comparison of results of observations in dynamics with the aim of obtaining views about their condition and trends. For the monitoring of social tension not less important is to develop the tools for such systematic tracking. As such a tool, the article presents the author's method of measurement «Questionnaire evaluation professionally difficult situations», which allows to identify which work-related social situations negatively affect the health and welfare of employees and to what extent; adversely affect the performance and quality of work, and to what extent; also a method to fixing the frequency of occurrence of such situations. In addition, the methodology included a questionnaire, to find out which method of conflict resolution people want to use to protect their interests. The article also describes the results of testing the methodology on the measurement of social tension in one of the engineering enterprises of the shipbuilding industry of St. Petersburg.",

      "title": "Social and psychological guidelines of the victimological research of fraud victim",
      "abstract": "35617 people suffered from fraud (9% victims of all crimes) in 2014 in Ukraine. However, considering the high level of fraud latency, mentioned number hardly reflects the actual amount of people affected by fraud. Victimological problems were and still are an object of both national and foreign scientists’ researches. Often many works cover only general issues of victimology, and there is a very few amount of a detailed victimological research of fraud (among the newest is the thesis of S. I. Afanasenko \"Victimological fraud prevention\"). The article aims to identify a social and psychological orientations in victimological research of fraud. Clarification of socio-psychological characteristics of the individual victim of fraud involves coverage of the following aspects of the problem: socio-psychological acquired features of an individual (needs, interests, beliefs, habits, etc.); communication, and social and psychological interference of individuals in society in general and in certain social groups; features of the mechanism of motivation of the individual in a group and in joint activities of the members of different groups; features of the person’s reaction on the influence of his environment; patterns of group (mass) behavior. One of the important features that reflect the main socio-psychological and personality trait is a way of life, which is a combination of several different but related types of social activity. The article highlights the main features of social and psychological victimization’s environment of most victims of fraud. Fraud victim is investigated in terms of its economic (proprietary, property) subjectivity. Some additional guidelines are identified. In particular, social and psychological factors of criticality’s, discretion’s reduction of a person. However, as a fraud is a crime against property, based in many cases on the use of social (including interpersonal) relations and interactions that mediate property relations, a victimological analysis is required for the following questions: a) possible and acceptable for victims ways of acquisition, retention and disposal of property; b) the usual economic behavior of victims. Thus, with the provided scheme of social and psychological components and factors that contribute to victimization of fraud victims, you can get quite reliable socio-psychological portrait of a potential fraud victim, which will subsequently be used for the reduction or even neutralizing the risk to suffer from this crime.",

      "title": "The straitjacket at workplace: Mobbing",
      "abstract": "Mobbing has been defined as a chronic asymmetric pattern of power relations and a consequent conflict transformed into a systematic discrimination or mistreatment at workplace which is expressed through unethical or aggressive communication (Leynman, 1996).Mobbing occurs when an employee in the workplace is steadily subjected to aggressive behavior from more than one colleague or supervisor over a period of time, in a situation where the target finds it difficult to defend him/herself to escape this dire situation.Such a long term incivility tends to stigmatize the mobbed victim and may cause severe psychological trauma since (s)he is metaphorically in a straitjacket.In this double-bind and double-squeeze condition where (s)he can neither get out of the situation nor endure the ordeal, a positive outcome is unlikely.How do we differentiate mobbing from conflict in organizations and how are disputes converted into mobbing behavior, and if one may even do research on mobbing in a culture of \"organizational silence\" and \"obedience/submission\" in a developing country will be the first theoretical research question.Whether systemic silence as a collective level phenomenon is not only an obstacle to healthy organizational communication and relationships, but also a serious barrier to development, participation and learning from malpractices is another relevant question.Most researches investigating the background of mobbing are based on either experiences of targets as victims or the critical cases including the perpetrators as mobber; Therefore, the findings are often at individual level and subjective.They are often \"ex post facto\" analysis of psychological dimensions (e.g., personality characteristics of mostly of mobbed victims and rarely of mobbers) or legal dimensions.There are few \"ex ante\" analyses of organizational culture dimensions so that preventive measures may be taken prior to any serious mobbing case is reported.This paper's objective is to approach mobbing as a function of group conflict and rumor that is uncontrolled for a long time.By exploring the background of mobbing in ten companies from service sector in Istanbul-Turkey, this view is assessed.The findings confirmed that mobbing is a function of relational conflict and gossip particularly in companies with high positional power distance and highly centralized decision-making where high power imbalance between supervisors and subordinates are salient.Such organizations seem to be more conducive to concealed mobbing and survival than to development and participation of employees as \"modus operandi\".",

      "abstract": "Community development faces various intrinsic challenges for which there are no easy answers. Although individual workers may well find pragmatic solutions that reflect local conditions, personal preferences and political priorities, expediency sometimes wins out over principles. Practitioners experience tensions and dilemmas arising from their numerous roles and commitments. The situations they face are often characterised by dynamic uncertainty, conflicting loyalties and confusing ‘role strain’ (Hoggett et al, 2009). Community development intervenes at different levels, from supporting standalone grassroots activities to campaigning locally for the aims of global social movements. Community organisers are located in a wide range of agencies, including trade unions, faith-based organisations, even some political parties. Where community-oriented posts still exist within local authorities, they may be found working in different departments with limited co-ordination. Years of falling budgets oblige specialist teams to cover several large areas, while their jobs are often located at the margins rather than the heart of the organisation. The purpose of community development is still contested in some quarters and it is frequently carried out through short-term micro-projects, fragmented funding and precarious job contracts, making it difficult to carve out a strategic and sustainable approach. In the UK the loss of core funding for the major agencies promoting community development has led to a decline in resources and training, eroding its fundamental commitments and leaving a fractured and insecure occupation split across different programmes and models. Internationally, the position is often just as bleak (Clarke et al, 2021). The key national infrastructure and membership networks that in the past brought practitioners and activists together and acted as champions for community development have closed down.",

We highlight a mechanism through which assortativity neglect, combined with strategic complementarities in agents’ behavior, drives up action dispersion in society (e.g., socioeconomic disparities in education investment). We also show how the combination of assortativity neglect and strategic incentives may help to explain empirically documented misperceptions of income inequality and political attitude polarization.",

      "abstract": "The language of anti-social behaviour has strong relationships to developments in the United Kingdom although its theoretical and empirical roots are from the United States of America (Millie et al. 2005). Within other western and developed nations the concept of anti-social behaviour is not a common part of academic or political language. For example, we do not see it discussed in public or policy debates in any substantial manner in the European Union, Australia or even the USA. This being said, concerns about behaviour, which is now being seen in the UK context as anti-social, such as 'incivilities' and 'minor' forms of misbehaviour within community settings, has a long history in US criminology and has recently infiltrated policy developments in some European nations (Burney 2005). The policy concept of anti-social behaviour though, is fundamentally a British phenomenon and a concept used to explain and define certain types of behaviour as criminal or deviant. There is also much uncertainty about what it means and how it can be defined (and measured) and much discussion over how anti-social behaviour is constructed around 'common-sense' understandings. For example, the UK government has continually claimed that we all understand what it is, even though a definition is hard to find. It tends therefore to be assumed that there is a consensus over its meaning, while in reality no such agreement exists (Millie et al. 2005). It is also worth acknowledging that anti-social behaviour is not necessarily defined as just a 'youthful activity'. In fact, its history is linked more to criminological debates on neighbourhood decline in the USA. This tends to see youth criminal behaviour as only one of many indicators of social decline. But in the UK context, anti-social behaviour has, over the past ten years, been more synonymous with problematic youthful activity in local neighbourhoods. It has also been used by both the media and government as a way of focusing attention on young people's relationships, not only with their communities but also as a symbol of a decline in 'respect' and an indicator of their lack of interest in making a positive contribution to society (France 2007).",

Not only must development agents, practitioners, and researchers seeking to influence change in a community consult community members, but the community needs to be active agents in decision making. Community engagement, when meaningfully and ethically undertaken, leads to productive outcomes. So often, however, the intended goals of such engagements do not always inure to the benefit of local communities; in fact, sometimes community engagement becomes exploitative, which raises critical concerns about ethics. This chapter takes up the ethical issues that make complex community engagement work. More so, it makes the case that a fixation on regulatory ethics—i.e., satisfying regulatory ethical codes and mandates—as the measuring stick for ethical community engagement is problematic. Rather, a focus on ethicality and accountability bodes well for the future of ethical practice in community engagement.",

Common for most of them is that the task of making new knowledge becoming useful in order to create new, better practices, is considered of equal importance as the creating of new knowledge as such. The theories and methods by which this task is performed vary a lot, but common to all of them is some kind of collaboration with actors in the field of study. Within the communities of social science the strategy of 'collaborating with the field' or 'object of study' has been subject to some methodological controversies. However, with the development of both the broad spectre of so-called qualitative methodology within the social sciences on the one hand and the philosophy/theory of science on the other hand, these kinds of controversies have culminated. Today we witness a growing interest in action research within academic institutions, particularly within those whose subject of study is organizations, institutions, professions, particular social groups, social movements etc. (Reason/Bradbury 2001). Issues like organisational renewal, organisational change and development, continuous improvements, total quality etc. have been among the main research issues from the very beginning of action research until today, together with community development and regional development (Cooke/Cox 2005). In accordance with the variety of approaches, also the outcome of the research projects varies a lot, regarding both the theoretical and practical outcome. There is, however, a significant convergence in the research findings, namely that they underline the importance of participation from the organisation members in enterprise development, organisation development or community development, as a condition for successful results. These findings coincide with - and supplement - the findings from cross-national surveys that explore the relationship between representative and direct participation in enterprise development (Frolich/Pekruhl 1996; Markey/Monat 1997; Heller et al. 1998). Even though today action research exists in a broad spectre of approaches, coexists in productive relations with other forms/approaches of social science, and is expanding into new fields of research, the institutional conditions of action research within the academic institutions around the globe are not really good and solidly anchored. Main evidence for this is to be found in the fact that action research is still not very high on the agenda of the national research policy in most countries, and action research still has a rather modest place and status in the curricula of universities/university colleges (Greenwood/Levin 2005). Thus, compared to the number of action research projects carried out today in an increasing number of academic milieus and research institutes the impact of action research at the national level still remains limited in most countries. Dilemma: The single action research project and the common project of action research Against this background the importance of action research conferences, action research journals and action research networks - both virtual and real - are acknowledged. These are necessary not only as a means of communication within the action research community. They are also necessary as a means of making action research become more strongly institutionalised within higher education, universities and research institutes. In short, the forums that today make up what we might call the (international) action research discourse also have to work as forums of action research policymaking. Indeed, the very existence of a number of journals particularly devoted to publishing articles on action research, like Educational Action Research, Systemic Practice and Action Research, Action Research and this journal, International Journal of Action Research, is - explicitly or implicitly - part of an effort to promote action research within the overall scientific community. …",

The concept of vulnerability seems to be relevant to highlight the challenges linked to inequalities and to find conditions for developing innovative actions responding to different contexts. Based on an interdisciplinary reflection, we explored the different views of vulnerability from health and social disciplines to find existing similarities and divergences. Numerous determinants of vulnerability have been identified in the literature, such as age, gender, health problems, and socioeconomic and environmental factors. We present some issues about individual and collective aspects of vulnerability from a territorial point of view. These situations of vulnerability present significant challenges for professionals and stakeholders in various health and social services sectors, both public and community-based. Taking actions to promote health among vulnerable people requires an understanding of their environment, in order to adjust to their health conditions, to community and organizational contexts, and to find strategies recognized as good practices linked to their real needs.",

Countercultures espouse primarily a cultural, rather than explicitly political, challenge commonly enacted through alternative lifestyles rather than direct challenges to institutional authority structures such as governments or corporations. While the term is widely used in both scholarly and pop culture contexts, its usage is imprecise. In the context of social movement studies, countercultures may be considered as a type of social movement (e.g. forms of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender movements), part of a social movement (e.g. cultural feminism), separate from but overlapping with social movements (e.g. hippies and the New Left), or more distinct from movements and conceptually closer to subcultures (e.g. punk). Contemporary definitions of social movements are broad enough to include the sorts of collective behavior typically labeled countercultural, sometimes called countercultural movements . Specifically, countercultures are extra‐institutional challenges to cultural (rather than institutional ) authority structures, generally informally organized yet having some degree of continuity.",

Yet, costless incentive schemes that entirely avoid free‐riding within a group might be undesirable, both individually and socially.

      "abstract": "Civic engagement is a classic example of a collective action problem: while civic participation improves life in the community as a whole, it is individually costly and thus there is an incentive to free ride on the actions of others. Yet, we observe significant inter-individual variation in the degree to which people are in fact civically engaged. Early accounts reconciling the theoretical prediction with empirical reality focused either on variation in individuals’ material resources or their attitudes, but recent work has turned to genetic differences between individuals. We show an underlying genetic contribution to an index of civic engagement (0.41), as well as for the individual acts of engagement of volunteering for community or public service activities (0.33), regularly contributing to charitable causes (0.28) and voting in elections (0.27). There are closer genetic relationships between donating and the other two activities; volunteering and voting are not genetically correlated. Further, we show that most of the correlation between civic engagement and both positive emotionality and verbal IQ can be attributed to genes that affect both traits. These results enrich our understanding of the way in which genetic variation may influence the wide range of collective action problems that individuals face in modern community life.",

      "title": "Problematizing EMI language policy in a transnational world",
      "abstract": "Language policies generally seek to establish, regulate, and conform linguistic practices – whether explicit or implicit – that occur within an ‘authorized’ domain. While there are multiple levels (societal, institutional, and interpersonal) at which such policies are enacted (Hornberger &amp; Johnson, 2007), academic institutions are often significant policy arbiters as they serve as crucial switchboards (Blommaert, 2010; De Costa, 2010) that connect policies at the societal and interpersonal levels. In particular, English medium of instruction (EMI) policies that mandate English as the primary means of academic content delivery have played a pivotal role in enabling universities in countries such as Bangladesh (Rahman &amp; Mehar Singh, 2019), China (e.g., Hu, 2009; Song, 2019; Zhang, 2018), Saudi Arabia (Barnawi, 2018; Phan &amp; Barnawi, 2015), and Vietnam (Phan, 2018) to establish themselves on the world stage and engage with the global community. Even though several scholars (e.g., Coleman, 2006; Jenkins, 2019a; Knight, 2013, 2016; Macaro et al., 2018) have investigated EMI policies across different contexts, the following central question concerning these policies still persists: in what ways has the implementation of EMI policies transformed the higher education sector, and subsequently affected primary social actors, such as students, teachers, and administrators embedded within these shifting contexts? These concerns, we posit, are amplified by the transnational movements of people and institutions (Duff, 2015) and the ever-increasing speed and agility with which TESOL as a field has to respond to the shifting tides of globalization (Barnawi, 2020). Given this conspicuous gap in an ever-evolving English language policy landscape, we set out to critically review previous works that have examined the implementation of EMI policies within a transnational higher education (TNHE) context. TNHE is characterized by the transformation of higher education across the globe (Knight, 2013; Kosmützky &amp; Putty, 2016) as Western-based universities export models – driven by a neoliberal agenda to maximize financial profit – through the establishment of overseas branch campuses. In reviewing works that examine TNHE, we aim to stimulate dialogue on this contemporary phenomenon.",

      "title": "Public Space",
      "abstract": "Sociology has an oddly imperfect, even problematic, relationship with public space (and space in general). Taking public space to mean any site that is, at least in principle, open and commonly accessible to all, it is of course the location for an enormous amount of all social interactions that occur outside of the intimacy of home or the professional context of work. It is the stage on which Goffman’s actors perform their presentations of self. From Simmel’s Metropolis and Mental Life through the research of the early Chicago School to countless contemporary ethnographies, urban space in particular is central to sociology. So much of social life takes place on streets or plazas, in public libraries, markets, and subway cars, or in so-called third spaces like cafes and pubs (public houses, after all). Public spaces have countless social characteristics and sociological implications. And yet relatively little sociological research focuses on public space itself, often relegating it at best to context—a crucial variable perhaps, certainly often a field site and the setting for a study, but rarely the object of analysis. Some sociologists who have followed a “spatial turn” are in truth interdisciplinarians by training (e.g., Herbert Gans, Neil Brenner); others began as sociologists and wound up rather outside of the discipline altogether (e.g., William H. Whyte). Still, public space is a natural domain of social research and ought to be a comfortable home to the sociologist. Whether for the pioneering community studies of the 20th century or today’s graduate students conducting surveys and observing daily life, the street corner, the park, the library are essential elements of study.",

We test whether people prefer to diversify their prosocial efforts across different types of help: casual help, direct help, indirect help and emotional support. In two daily diary studies (total N = 711), we examine whether previous prosocial behaviour affects subsequent prosocial behaviour for the same or other types of prosocial behaviour. We found that day-to-day prosocial behaviours reflected a diversified helping pattern. Participants were less likely to help the same way (i.e. the same type of prosocial behaviour) on subsequent days and more likely to help in different ways (i.e. a different type of prosocial behaviour). This tendency did not extend to casual help in Study 2, implying that the next day reduction in doing the same type of prosocial behaviour is limited to prosocial behaviours that are at least somewhat effortful or time consuming.",

Various of today’s thinkers have predicted the decline or even the end of national ideologies. In the area of language, postmodernism would make the linguistic affiliation of the community individuals irrelevant, de-ideologise language use, and extend plurilingualism and language alternation in association with a new distribution of (physical or functional) spaces of linguistic practice. But is this true everywhere? Are languages now nowhere the core of collective identity? Or are we witnessing a distinction between languages that, because of their magnitude, status, strategic position, etc., can continue to exercise the function of national languages and languages that have to renounce this function? Has national linguistic ideology really ceased to make sense? What other strategies should the historic language of a given geographic area employ if it wants to continue forming part of the life of the community that is set up there? What kinds of languages are desired by politicians, intellectuals and philologists? This book aims to bring some thoughts about these questions.",

      "title": "MODERN FORMS OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS SOLVING (ON THE EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL BUSINESS)",
      "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to justify social business as a modern form of solving social problems. It is noted that social business arises in the sphere of providing social services. Attention is focused on the very nature of the participation of social businessmen who, through their own activity, satisfy a socially significant demand for certain segments of the population, that is, capable of solving social problems of certain population groups or individuals. It is justified that the idea of modern social business is considered through the historical milestones of its evolution. It is noted that in different periods of society's evolution, the social problems themselves changed, as did their depth for different social groups. The main periods of origin, development and active spread of social business are considered. It is noted that at the first stage, the activities of charitable, volunteer and public organizations in their modern sense were born and gradually spread. Such activities were implemented at the expense of collecting membership fees from citizens or donations from various categories of the population in order to solve a specific social problem. It was determined that the next stage in the development of social business began at the end of the 20th century as a result of the creation of the first social enterprises. It is during this period that the concept of \"social business\" begins to be used, which takes on the characteristics of a socio-economic phenomenon and is the subject of independent research by scientists. Thus, analyzing the given historical milestones in the development of the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship, two approaches to solving social problems that have arisen in society are highlighted: financial and institutional. It was concluded that the form of solving a social problem should be defined as a method by which a particular type of social problem is mitigated/solved, i.e. providing social services and carrying out social work aimed at supporting the most socially vulnerable categories and persons who find themselves in difficult life circumstances. It is noted that it is appropriate to include social assistance, social protection, and corporate social responsibility of business as a financial form of solving a social problem. Due to the implementation of these forms of solving social problems, societal, group and individual social problems are solved. It is substantiated that under the institutional approach, the solution of social problems is the main type of activity of the relevant business entity and is carried out systematically. In this way, social business acquires such an institutional form that is able to more flexibly contribute to the solution of social problems, that is, social enterprises are formed. The article emphasizes that a social problem is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon that includes many components. General trends in solving social problems in specific countries are concentrated in the principles of social policy formed in it. In addition, social business is essentially an organic component of the social protection system, and therefore an element of the country's social policy. It was concluded that the main differences between the social responsibility of business and social entrepreneurship in solving social problems of society lie in their differences in the very form of solving social problems. For a social business, profit is ensured by solving social problems, which is again reinvested in projects to solve social problems.",

However, the metaphor of the networks has the particularity to suggest relationships that are not in the simple duality / state, as a redificada delivers images to different categories such as civil society or social actor. The appeal of the redificacion is more important in a period where the deterioration of the nation states unarmed societies leaves behind him, fought to pure means of the global market. But if the withdrawal of the state is in a attached internally by multiple communication networks, the prospects are not only disastrous, as they want us to believe ideologists of globalisation: it is necessary to shift the gaze from the State (Marxist and neo-liberal obsession ) into space for the formation of a functional society. Resumen . La mayoria de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales son metaforas que solo pueden dar cuenta imaginativa de la realidad, sin pretender ningun absolutismo sobre la llamada realidad objetiva. Sin embargo, la metafora de las redes tiene la particularidad de sugerir relaciones que no se encuentran en la simple dualidad sociedad/Estado, pues una sociedad redificada entrega imagenes diferentes a categorias como “sociedad civil” o “actor social”. El recurso de la redificacion es mas importante en un periodo donde el deterioro de los Estados nacionales deja sociedades inermes detras de si, libradas a los puros arbitrios del mercado mundial. Pero si el retiro del Estado se realiza en una sociedad sujetada interiormente por multiples redes comunicativas, las perspectivas no pueden ser solamente catastroficas, como quieren hacernos creer los ideologos de la globalizacion: se hace necesario desplazar la mirada desde el Estado (obsesion marxista y neoliberal) hacia el espacio de la constitucion organica de la sociedad.",

      "title": "Socioecological metabolism: investigating sustainability across scales",
      "abstract": "Sustainability challenges are related to socioecological interactions occurring on various spatial and temporal scales. Processes on different scales are linked, hence place- or site-based research – such as many LT(S)ER approaches – needs embedding in larger, often global contexts. This is even more relevant today, as rising geopolitical tensions, international conflicts and wars, pandemics and increasingly frequent and severe impacts of climate heating drive the world towards a multipolar ‘divided world’ scenario. Socioecological metabolism (SEM) is an increasingly widespread and powerful approach to study societies’ material basis. SEM is focused on societies’ use of biophysical resources (materials, energy or land) in production and consumption processes that underly delivery of services essential for social wellbeing (e.g., shelter, nutrition, mobility, education, healthcare, hygiene and many more). In the process, societies accumulate ‘material stocks’ in buildings, infrastructures, machinery or other artefacts, in addition to the bodies of humans and livestock belonging to any specific society. Delivery of services requires specific combinations of material stocks and energy or material flows (the ‘stock-flow-service nexus’). At the same time, patterns of societal material stocks shape practices of dwelling, being mobile, nourishing oneself and so on that are intimately interrelated with patterns and levels of resource use, thereby shaping (un)sustainability (the ‘stock-flow-practice nexus’). SEM is directly and indirectly related to ecological impacts at all stages, from extraction to accumulation of stocks and outflows of wastes and emissions. For example, biomass extraction affects roughly three quarters of the earth’s lands (except Antarctica and Greenland), thereby contributing to the global land squeeze and to pressures on biodiversity. Built structures (buildings and infrastructures), while occupying a relatively small proportion of earth’s land surface, structure landscapes and have far-reaching ecological consequences, e.g. by restricting movement of species or opening pristine regions for development. Outflows of wastes and emissions, among others, drive global heating, which again affects ecosystems across all scales. In this presentation, I will review the current state-of-the-art in terms of quantifying and modelling socioecological metabolism and studying its relations with societies and their economies. In addition to highlighting some current highly granular (up to 10m spatial resolution nation-wide, 90m global) and long-term (&amp;gt;100 years) quantifications of stocks and flows in SEM, I will discuss current progress in linking SEM data with social wellbeing and achievement of decent living standards. I will also provide an outlook to ongoing research aiming at a better understanding of the effects of disruptions on SEM and its wellbeing contributions. Given that current SEM methods are only descriptive, static or at best represent linear dynamics, this will involve integration with models from complexity science that can grasp the non-linear dynamics of networked systems (tipping points, phase transitions, etc.). Efforts are also under way to harness the power of the emerging highly granular SEM data and models for transformative research by linking them with actors, institutions and power relations to investigate the malleability of social metabolism. This recent and ongoing research aims to provide a robust basis for integrating social sciences and natural sciences when studying the sustainability of globally embedded socio-ecological systems. The SEM approach hence can crucially contribute to integrating local, actor-centered and participatory research into larger-scale models and assessments.",

      "title": "Learning and Identity",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses how an individual’s identity has an eﬀect on their learning and vice versa. In particular it\nfocuses on what it means to have an identity as someone who sees oneself, and is seen by signiﬁcant others, as\na competent learner. When thinking about identity it is usual to focus on the characteristics of an individual\nthat are maintained over time and that distinguish one person from another. However, identity is socially\nconstructed in interaction with others and so it is dynamic and only relatively stable (see Schuller et al., 2004).\nIt follows from this that identity is not ﬁxed, but is created and re-created in interactions between the\nindividual and the social world that they inhabit (Bauman, 1996; Sfard and Prusak, 2005; Wenger, 1998).\nThis does not mean, however, that identity is completely ﬂuid, since individuals seek to make sense of their\nexperiences by constructing patterns of consistency and coherence regarding the nature of their identity in\ntheir relationships with others.\nLearning has a strong relationship to identity because, through the institutions of the family, educationand work, the individual’s outlook and self-image are socially shaped so that ‘fundamental to our understanding of learning … is our understanding of the whole person in a social situation’ (Jarvis, 2009: 31).\nViewing learning and identity as developing through social relationships and within particular contexts or\n‘communities of practice’ (Wenger, 1998) is also helpful in dealing with issues of power and responsibilities\nbecause it addresses:how collective discourses shape personal worlds and how individual voices combine into the voice of\na community … [as well as] the mechanisms through which the collective and the common enter\nindividual activities … through learning.",

      "abstract": "The word “ethics” refers to a position, or rule, stated in the form of a moral imperative, with \nthe implication that if one’s conduct is guided by this rule, one will be acting ethically. Behavior \nconsistent with following the rules in society may be reinforced, and behavior inconsistent with \nfollowing the rule may be punished. Such moral imperatives change over time. Sometimes these \nchanges are a mere recloaking of past practices. Sometimes ethical conduct evolves gradually. \nFor example, as more evidence accrues regarding treatment efficacy and safety, ethical standards \nof professional conduct may gradually shift. As more effective treatments are identified, new \ninformation concerning new treatment outcomes is found, such as when long-term follow-up \ndata are reported, new data on long-term harms, and data on new treatments that are superior \nto old treatments are reported; then the specifics of ethical professional conduct change over \ntime. Sometimes changes in professional and societal ethics are more radical. For example, recent \nchanges in statements on human rights of people with disabilities (United Nations, 2007) and \nU.S. federal legal decisions establishing the right to life in the community for people with disabilities (Olmstead v. L.C., 1999) have resulted in rapid and dramatic shifts in services away from \nsegregated to integrated services in many countries; prior to Olmsted, a safe, clean, well-run \ninstitution was legal and ethical.

      "title": "Self-Organization in Decentralized Agent Societies through Social Norms (Extended Abstract)",
      "abstract": "Social norms help people self-organizing in many situations where having an authority representative is not feasible. On the contrary to institutional rules, the responsibility to enforce social norms is not the task of a central authority but a task of each member of the society. “The social norms I am talking about are not the formal, prescriptive or proscriptive rules designed, imposed, and enforced by an exogenous authority through the administration of selective incentives. I rather discuss informal norms that emerge through the decentralized interaction of agents within a collective and are not imposed or designed by an authority”[3]. In recent years, the use of social norms has been considered also as a mechanism to regulate virtual societies and specifically heterogeneous societies formed by humans and artificial agents. One of the main topics of research regarding the use of social norms in virtual societies is how they emerge, that is, how social norms are created at first instance. We divide the emergence of norms into two different stages: (a) how norms appear in the mind of one or several individuals and (b) how these new norms are spread over the society until they become accepted social norms. We are interested in studying the second stage, the spreading and acceptance of social norms, what Axelrod [2] defines as norm support. Our understanding of norm support deals with the problem of which norm is established as the dominant. Specifically, we deal with two different branches of the research on normative sytems: conventional norms and essential norms.

The scientific question of this research is how to accelerate the establishment of a common norm in virtual societies: in the case of conventional norms, by dissolving the subconventions; and in the case of essential norms, by studying the effects of punishment and norm internalization.",

      "title": "Peers at Work - a Brief Overview of the Literature on Peer Effects at the Workplace and the Policy Implications",
      "abstract": "Individuals do not exist in isolation but are embedded within networks of relationships, such as families, coworkers, neighbors, friendships or socioeconomic groups. While there is a long tradition in sociology and anthropology focusing on theimportance of social structure, norms and culture, economists have long ignored social influences on individual behavior. Even though social influences may play an important role in the evaluation of policies, economic evaluations are typicallyfocused on the central question how individuals independently respond to financial incentives. However, economic reforms or the introduction of new policy instruments are likely to affect individuals not only directly by the change in financial incentives, but also indirectly by a change in the behavior of the social environment. At the workplace, one can distinguish four contexts where peer effects may be relevant factors in explaining the observed outcomes; these are (a) job search and employment probabilities; (b) fertility, parental leave and female labor supply; (c) productivity and work place behavior; and (d) retirement and pension plan decisions. Consequently, it is of large importance to understand and predictsocial interaction effects in these four areas of research and comprehend the implications for economic policy. In the following, I will give an overview of the existing literature in each of the contexts where peer effects at work may evolve, after briefly discussing the challenges associated with the empirical analysis of peer effects.",

Se le pueden asociar distintos sentidos. Desde hace mas de un siglo, se habla de riesgos profesionales. De este modo se designan ciertas situaciones o ciertos acontecimientos que pueden provocar danos a la salud y que permiten reconocer e indemnizar estos danos como accidentes del trabajo o enfermedades profesionales. Esta nocion de riesgos profesionales es una construccion social que aisla ciertos elementos en el trabajo (por ejemplo, un nivel de ruido, una sustancia quimica) y los asocia a una patologia o una afeccion a la salud determinadas. Esta construccion tiene, a la vez, la ventaja de evitar un largo peritaje medico y juridico para establecer la causa de la situacion y el inconveniente de excluir de su aplicacion todo aquello que no entra exactamente en las definiciones propuestas. Como toda construccion social, lleva las marcas de las relaciones de fuerzas y de los valores de la sociedad en la cual se inscribe. • De este modo, durante decadas, una parte importante del establishment medico nego que la silicosis fuera una enfermedad profesional y el reconocimiento de esta fue el resultado de una relacion de fuerzas mas que de una progresion cientifica espontanea.",

      "title": "Social network heterogeneity benefits individuals at the expense of groups in the creation of innovation",
      "abstract": "Innovation is fundamental for development and provides a competitive advantage for societies. It is the process of creating more complex technologies, ideas, or protocols from existing ones. While innovation may be created by single agents (i.e. individuals or organisations), it is often a result of social interactions between agents exchanging and combining complementary expertise and perspectives. The structure of social networks impacts this knowledge exchange process. To study the role of social network structures on the creation of new technologies, we design an evolutionary mechanistic model combining self-creation and social learning. We find that social heterogeneity allows agents to leverage the benefits of diversity and to develop technologies of higher complexity. Social heterogeneity, however, reduces the group ability to innovate. Not only the social structure but also the openness of agents to collaborate affect innovation. We find that interdisciplinary interactions lead to more complex technologies benefiting the entire group but also increase the inequality in the innovation output. Lower openness to interdisciplinary collaborations may be compensated by a higher ability to collaborate with multiple peers, but low openness also neutralises the intrinsic benefits of network heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that social network heterogeneity has contrasting effects on microscopic (local) and macroscopic (group) levels, suggesting that the emergence of innovation leaders may suppress the overall group performance.",

      "title": "Multicultural Service-Learning And Community-Based Research As a Model Approach to Promote Social Justice",
      "abstract": "THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO INCORPORATE MULTICULTURAL SERVICE-LEARNING AND community-based research into curricula offerings to more effectively train future service providers who work with diverse populations in disenfranchised communities. Community-academic partnerships are presented as a model to help to create systemic change in academic institutions and communities. Benefits of the model include increasing the cultural competency of professionals-in-training through their application of theory and methods within a multicultural context. Case examples designed to empower marginalized communities are presented. Last, to inform the work of educators, researchers, and community activists, I provide a series of recommendations that are designed to enhance the potential of these models to promote social justice. Social justice and multicultural awareness are inextricably linked. Sleeter (1996: 239) defines social justice as having the perspective that allows one to take social action against social structural inequality and an understanding of oppression and inequality which allows greater insight into methods of eradicating them. I argue that social justice work can be operationalized in various ways, such as any action to: (a) eliminate or reduce disparities based on various social categories such as race or ethnicity; (b) promote equality in educational, health, and legal services; (c) advocate for disenfranchised and underserved groups, and (d) promote and evaluate the delivery of culturally competent services and systems of care. Furthermore, I argue that multicultural service-learning and community-based research (including empowerment evaluation) can raise awareness of various social justice issues and promote action geared toward social change. Through application of these approaches in a community context, student learning is enhanced in a way that promotes increased understanding of social inequities. According to the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC, 1995: 1), service-learning is an instructional methodology [that] integrates community service with academic instruction as it focuses on critical, reflective thinking and civic responsibility. Other authors have emphasized the critical role of reflection in processing the affective, personal, and empathic dimensions of student experience to bring about a deeper understanding of social problems (Eyler, Giles, and Schmiede, 1996). Research has shown that service-learning is an effective method for increasing civic engagement, commitment to service, and motivation to reduce social inequities (Furco and Billig, 2002; Eyler, Giles, and Schmiede, 1996). Multicultural service-learning promotes the strength and value of cultural diversity and focuses on equitable distribution of power among racial and ethnic groups, as well as between those providing service and those served. There has been a wealth of recent research in teacher education on service-learning as a method to help educators bring about increased understanding of diversity, culture, difference, and power (Boyle-Baise, 2002; O'Grady, 2000; Clark and Clark, 1996; Furco, 1996). A number of authors have differentiated service-learning, volunteerism, community service, and internships (see, e.g., Furco, 1996; Sigmon, 1994). Furco (1996) developed a continuum based on the intended beneficiaries (i.e., provider or recipient) and focus of the activity (i.e., learning or service). For example, internships tend to benefit the provider (i.e., the student) with learning as the primary focus. On the other hand, volunteerism tends to focus more on service with an emphasis on recipient benefits (i.e., the community organization). Service-learning is an approach that balances these criteria in a way that benefits providers and recipients equally (Ammon, 1998). Similarly, Sigmon (1994) emphasizes that service and learning goals should be of equal weight and that each should enhance the other for all participants. …",

      "title": "Understanding the problem of cultural non-participation : discursive structures, articulatory practice and cultural domination",
      "abstract": "This thesis employs a discursive methodology to analyse the policy problem of cultural non-participation. In so doing it seeks to answer the questions of what the problem is, why a problem exists, and what the existence of the problem does ‘in the real’ (Bacchi, 2009). The study draws on primary data generated in the form of policy texts, speeches and 42 in-depth qualitative interviews with individuals working in or for publicly funded cultural organisations in Scotland. Employing the methodological approach of problematisation (Foucault, 2003a [1981]), the study offers a close analysis of the discursive logics upon which the construction of the problem relies. In so doing it is asserted that the problem construction functions as an articulatory practice (Laclau & Mouffe, 1985) that not only constitutes and organizes social relations but also supports asymmetric relations of power and allows inequality in society to be represented as both inevitable and sensible (Ranciere, 2004).\r\nBeginning with a discussion of how cultural participation has been constructed as an object of enquiry, the thesis moves on to consider how cultural non-participation is constructed as a problem across the discursive planes of politics and professional practice. Having made visible the discursive logics of the problem construction, the discussion then examines the contingent historical conditions under which the existence of certain subjects, objects, and the intelligible relations between them became possible. Arguing that the Arts should be understood as a discursive institution, it is proposed that the subject identity of the non-participant is not only a necessary part of the discursive logic of this institution, but also provided the ideal boundary object (Star and Griesemer, 1989) around which the legitimacy of the relationship between the Arts and the state could, in part, be based.\r\nDrawing on the work of Jacques Ranciere (1991; 2004; 2004), it is argued that the manner in which those labelled as non-participants are subjectified obscures their agency and in so doing suppresses their capacity to speak within the field of cultural policy. As such, the field of cultural policy remains characterized by asymmetric relations of power and dominated by those who lay claim to the discursive identity of cultural professionals. The result is state subsidised practices that while doing little to influence individual patterns of behavior, through performing inclusion and equality contribute to the maintenance of a status-quo in which state support will only be provided to individuals who accept the values of those who exercise the most power in the field.",

Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa strategi adaptasi masyarakat terbagi menjadi tiga aspek utama: fisik, sosial, dan ekonomi. Meskipun Pemerintah Kota Makassar telah mengimplementasikan sejumlah strategi adaptasi, terdapat keterbatasan dalam upaya adaptasi kolektif. Masyarakat lebih cenderung menggunakan strategi adaptasi reaktif daripada proaktif, yang menunjukkan kekurangan dalam integrasi sosial dan koordinasi antar pemangku kepentingan.

      "title": "Measuring Acoustic Social Worlds: Reflections on a Study of Multi-Agent Human Interaction",
      "abstract": "When individuals are sharing similar behavioral, physiological, or neural states—that is, when individuals’ actions, body states, or brain activity are changing together in time—then a collective interpersonal synergy forms (Riley et al., 2011). Each individual starts to behave together as a member of one large group. Measurement of an interpersonal synergy can be indicative of shared social cognition—of joint participation in co-regulating multiple patterns of activity between two or more agents engaged in a social interaction (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010). In order to examine the dynamics of multiagent groups of people, and the emergence of these interpersonal synergies, scientists generally measure signals emitted by each individual to detect correlations between these signals.However, humans are highly capable of tracking complex behavioral dynamics of multiagent groups in our everyday interactions with the world even without access to individual behavioral, physiological, or neural signals from each individual agent. Our everyday human interactions provide us with access to a shared and co-created acoustic social world. Interactions among members of musical ensembles in particular provide useful insight into the co-creation of acoustic social worlds and the emergence of collective synergies. In the context of 4E cognition and the dynamical systems framework, this chapter provides an examination of the measurement of collective synergies from acoustic signals not of individual musicians, but of the acoustic signal co-created by a musical ensemble as a whole, in performance of a musical work that was composed to highlight the emergence of such a collective synergy.",

El artículo plantea la posibilidad de seguir un camino inverso poniendo acento en una pedagogía que trabaje para la comunidad. En esa perspectiva se asume el diagnóstico que las sociedades monoculturales, centradas en la república y la modernidad, están en retirada y que, por lo tanto, nos encontramos en la era de las diferencias. Es así como la pedagogía debe aprender a trabajar con diversos colectivos, muchos de ellos en pugna, pero de aquí se desprende el énfasis en desarrollar una pedagogía intercultural y comunitaria.",

      "abstract": "Chapter 2 Metadiscourse as discourse reflexivityOur understanding of humans as a unique species has received serious blows over the last hundred years or so.Other species build sophisticated dwellings and complex social systems, benefit from symbioses with other species, use and make tools.In important respects the distinction between humans and many other species looks like a matter of degree, including communicative systems (N. Lee et al. 2009; Tomasello 2014;), as recently posthumanism has emphasised, including linguistics (Evans 2014; Pennycook 2017).Some traits are nevertheless particularly highly developed in humans and characterise our species: the tendency to collaborate more than other species, and the tendency to communicate more than other species.Both characteristics relate to the fundamentally social nature of humans, and the vital importance of social interaction to their life and success.Many researchers in different fields have made similar observations about collaboration, and Mercier and Sperber (2017) make both.Communication is thus inextricably intertwined with collaboration.We need to understand, or make good guesses about, each other's intentions, meanings, and emotional states to collaborate successfully.Not only that, but above all, we need to work towards shared and new meanings jointly, largely if not exclusively through language, in other words collaborate to communicate and create new understanding and knowledge in the process.In brief, we must communicate to collaborate, and collaborate to communicate.To achieve this, we rely on communicative resources that are sophisticated, flexible, and amenable to change and adaptation.One of the properties of human language that may not find equivalents in the communication systems of other species and may therefore give us some communicative advantage is its capacity to talk about itself self-reflexively while the same system can also be used for talking about other matters.There is a meta-level of communication, a reflexive possibility in human discourse that enables us to indicate how we intend our interlocutors to take what we are saying and how it relates to what they are saying.This, in short, is the domain of discourse reflexivity, or reflexive metadiscourse. Metadiscourse and the ongoing discourseThe idea of metadiscourse has not been without its critics.Objections have been raised to the concept altogether.One is that the whole notion is trivial, the other that it is misuse of the prefix meta-.The triviality objection holds that there is",

Naime, autorica smatra kako specificne drustvene interakcije i drustveni odnosi uvjetuju intenziviranje zlouporabe opojnih droga. Svakako su najizraženiji drustveni utjecaji, kao sto su nepovoljni obiteljski, skolski, medijski ili neki drugi drustveni aspekt (institucionalni, organizacijski i sl.). Svi oni zajedno u vise ili manje isprekidanim interakcijskim procesima, nastaju kao posljedica izraženijih utjecaja pojedinih socijalnih, posebno ekonomskih i drugih drustvenih procesa ili odnosa (obrazovnih, politickih i sl.). Konstatira da su mladi drustvena skupina koja je najugroženija po pitanju ovisnosti i to posebno onih opijatskoga tipa. Njihov drustveni položaj u Hrvatskoj pocetkom treceg milenija nije bitnije prosperirao, jer su to onemogucavali nepovoljni aspekti drustvenog življenja. Korijeni nekih aspekata drustvene marginalizacije ovisnickih skupina moguce je pronaci u temeljnim socio-profesionalnim obilježjima mladenackih drustvenih skupina. Među istraživackim rezultatima (iz 2002. godine) raspravljaju se nalazi o najkoristenijoj drogi ; najcescem mjestu drogiranja ; najcescem nacinu nabave droge ; te drugim uzrocima i razlozima drogiranja. Masovnije eksplicirana posljedica drogiranja svakako je opcenita promjena ponasanja ovisnika, s dalekosežnim posljedicama u obiteljskim relacijama. Također se tretiraju i misljenja ispitanih građana Hrvatske o drustvenima problemima koje treba nužno rijesavati, jer ih svrstavaju u temeljne generatore nastanka ovisnosti opcenito. To su npr. nezaposlenost, kriminal, korupcija, nemoral i dr. Autorica zakljucuje kako je nužno usmjeravati drustvene akcije u djelotvorniju drustvenu promociju razlicitih tipova prevencije vezane uz ovisnicki kontekst. Stoga je nužan intenzivniji razvoj znanstvenih istraživanja ovisnosti, uz njegovanje razlicitih pristupa i metodoloskih orijentacija u takvim strategijama.",

Social and negative nature of deviations is destructive both for a personality, and for society. However this type of deviant behaviour causes the greatest interest of researchers and is more often considered in social and psychological literature. Deviation is a border between norm and pathology, extreme option of norm. There is an opinion that the main factors predetermining deviations in human behaviour are: the level of public consciousness, moral, the system of social regulations fixed in society. The deviance cant be defined, without relying on knowledge of norms. Some scientists define norm as a limit which has historically developed in a particular society, a measure of admissible behaviour. The certain properties which are initially inherent in the majority of people are behaviour standards, their norm-ideals. As the level of interiorization of norms in different social environments has essential differences, and norm-ideals (system of the main values) have globalized character, they are difficult in application to particular social objects. It is offered to consider a norm in three different values: statistical, functional (individual) and ideal. Social norm finds the embodiment (support) in laws, traditions, customs, i.e. in all that has become a habit, strongly has become usual, in a way of life of majority of the population, which is supported by public opinion, and plays a role of a natural regulator of public and interpersonal relations.

      "abstract": "Self-determination (SDT) provides a thoughtful analysis of the psychological needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy, the adaptive value of these needs, as well as how these needs relate to past contemporary theories of motivation. SDT is one of the few theories within psychology that extends and complements the logic that rewards and punishments always guide people in the predicted direction: Indeed, rewards may have hidden costs as well as hidden gains. Given that rewards and cost are so omnipresent, the processes outlined by SDT should be relevant to many different situations, varying from close relationships, educational settings, organizations, to societies at large. It also interesting to note that SDT seems particularly relevant to social dilemmas: conflicts between self-interest and collective interest (Komorita & Parks, 1995). According to SDT, people may not always respond to externally provided cost and rewards in a manner consistent with economic theory and rational choice models. For example, in regulating social dilemmas, governments may sometimes exert too much control, so that the provision of rewards for cooperative behavior (e.g., tax reduction for those who commute by public transportation rather than by car) tum out less effective than many policymakers had anticipated. Some work on social dilemmas provides at least indirect support for this reasoning, although it is not clear whether the hidden costs of rewards ultimately need to be understood in terms of the needs for competence, relatedness, or autonomy (e.g., Van Lange, Van Vugt, & De Cremer, 2000). In this commentary, I discuss the utility of SDT in the context of interpersonal situations. The basic thrust of this commentary is that although SDT can provide a reasonable account of motivational processes in interpersonal situations, this account needs to be considered in light of alternative theories that focus on the sequence of behavior (i.e., patterns of social interaction) and relationship-relevant features that shape motivation, behavior, and interaction.",

It would be not be correct identifying Citizenship Education only with elements of Civic Education, as it would restrict its range to formal level of rules and laws, rights and duties. Otherwise, limiting its understanding only on elements of Sociopolitical Education, would offer the risk of investing in cultural similarities, common roots, values homogeneity, that are strong in giving hold on identity, membership, participation, but so exposed to acts of fanaticism, exclusion of diversity, hostility towards minorities. Therefore, it is necessary to assume that Citizenship Education has to be established on problematic integration of the two presented perspectives, thus founding knowledge and practice about the rules of civil society on the system of values and cultural aspects that every single micro-community (and every single individual) recognizes to be source of the rules: a complex system of various elements made of homogeneity and inhomogeneity, similarities and differences in constant modification an dynamic intercommunication.",

      "title": "Learning together: facing the challenges of sustainability transitions by engaging uncertainty tolerance and post-normal science",
      "abstract": "Abstract Current efforts towards sustainability tend to focus on maintaining existing systems and structures, by relying on reductionist approaches to problem solving. Increasingly, there is a call for more effective action in reaching sustainability, not through reductionism (e.g. solutions which reinforce the status quo), but through transformative societal changes and cultural shifts. Despite these calls, widespread resistance to such changes remains. This work discusses one of the underlying causes, namely maladaptive responses to uncertainty. Uncertainty impacts nearly every aspect of sustainability transformations within a society. There are uncertainties related to the defining characteristics of sustainability, the complexity of sustainability, and to the changing roles and identities of individuals within a society as they transition to sustainability. Furthermore, the process which is increasingly called upon to address these diverse sources of uncertainty, known as post-normal science, introduces novel sources of uncertainty. Up to this point, many societies’ responses to this array of sustainability transitions uncertainty is to respond maladaptively, representing uncertainty in tolerance (e.g. denial, dismissal, disengagement), as opposed to adaptive responses (e.g. curiosity, acknowledgement and action). Herein, we describe the sources of uncertainty related to sustainable transitions, the role that post-normal science can play in addressing these uncertainties, and describe strategies to support societies’ collective capacity for developing uncertainty tolerance to better engage with the processes required for a sustainable future.",

Yet a central issue facing contemporary social work is its seeming reticence to engage with social problems, and their solutions, beyond individual-level interventions. Social work research, we contend, must more consistently link case and cause, iteratively developing processes for bringing micro-, mezzo-, and macrostreams of information together. We further argue that meaningful engagement with the initiative requires social work scholars and practitioners to actively scale up practice and research inquiry. We detail two key strategies for employing a scaled-up social work practice and research ethos: (a) employing a critical economic lens and (b) engaging with diverse publics. As proof of concept for these arguments, we offer an early example of progressive era social workers scaling up responses to a pressing social issue: infant mortality.",

Intergroup relations has a high profi le in social psychology because society is organized into groups that need to be able to get on with one another; and yet intergroup perceptions and behavior are generally ethnocentric and competitive, and have a notable tendency to degenerate into stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and destructive confl ict. Confl ictual intergroup relations are a signifi cant problem for society (see Chapter 12, this volume). The challenge for society is to be able to manage intergroup relations such that the enormous social promise of intergroup cooperation can be fulfi lled.",

      "abstract": "Within the past two decades Somalia became synonymous with everything from violence, famine to religious extremism. Somalia is a country with contradictions. On the one hand, it is a country with relatively homogeneous people in terms of language, ethnicity, culture and religion. On the other hand, we see a nation that so far failed to translate the cultural and social relationship to a legitimate functioning political and institutional system. Contemporary experts of the Somali society underline the significance of the Somali language, especially in Somali proverbs, not only reflecting the essence of culture but also everything about the Somalis. For instance the nation’s short histories and proverbs contain not only description and analysis of the society, but also solutions to the numerous challenges facing the country (Kapchitz, 2010). Somalis themselves, as well as the rest of the world, underestimate the Somali’s ability to interpret and develop their political culture and society through language and literature. The political and economic elite have for decades ignored or oppressed people’s attempt to build their society with linguistic and communicative public engagement based on mutual understanding and respect (Farah & Yusuf, 2003).",

Les rumeurs qui courent à ce sujet veulent que dans certains cas le prix du succès soit le sacrifice (mystique) d’un être cher ou d’un membre de la famille. Publiquement, les musiciens nient toute association avec la sorcellerie : non parce qu’ils ne croient pas en l’existence du phénomène, mais parce qu’y participer serait vu comme anti-social et égoïste. Cela montre à quel point la moralité est un critère d’évaluation du goût esthétique. Sous le régime de Mobutu, la corruption est une stratégie de survie et la circulation de ce genre de rumeurs sert à renforcer l’idée que la réussite individuelle peut se traduire en mobilité sociale autrement que par des moyens sournois et arbitraires.",

      "title": "CSR disclosure: cross-national differences in seven european countries",
      "abstract": "A key component of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is communicating it with the appropriate degree of social disclosure. To manage effectively a social disclosure requires that companies understand the cultural context in which they communicate. Even though scholars tend to agree on a relationship between culture and social disclosures there are no studies directly comparing CSR communication among companies from different European contexts. The aim of this study is to explore if CSR disclosure has a cross-national or global tendency by means of a double-phase investigation among 251 companies with headquarters in seven European countries: Spain, France, Switzerland, UK, Denmark, Italy and Greece. In a first phase, a content analysis permits to investigate national differences in how companies disclose CSR. In a second phase qualitative interviews with 69 communication directors or CSR directors explore different managers’ perspectives on how they see CSR communication as a problematic task. L’appropriatezza del livello di social disclosure nella comunicazione della responsabilita sociale d’impresa (CSR) e una componente chiave della CSR. Per gestire correttamente la social disclosure e necessario che l’impresa comprenda il contesto culturale in cui comunica. Sebbene la relazione tra cultura e social disclosure sia riconosciuta, non esistono studi transnazionali che comparano la comunicazione della CSR nei diversi paesi europei. Attraverso un’indagine in due fasi condotta in 251 imprese con sede in sette paesi europei (Spagna, Francia, Svizzera, GB, Danimarca, Italia e Grecia), gli autori si propongono di indagare l’esistenza di una tendenza cross-nazionale o globale nella CSR disclosure. Nella prima fase vengono tracciate attraverso una analisi del contenuto le differenze nella social disclosure tra le imprese del campione. Nella seconda fase vengono approfondite le problematiche relative alla comunicazione della CSR, attraverso interviste qualitative a 69 direttori comunicazione e CSR.",

      "abstract": "Having neither rules nor referees, based on unwritten ethical rules, alpinism lends itself to diverse appropriations. Indeed, the ways to envisage climbing have never stopped evolving and reasons initially given to justify going mountain climbing have changed in the course of time. In order to overcome the hurdles linked to the transformations of this ambivalent discipline, cultural history leaning on contributions from social sciences seeks to better distinguish between those traditions – either aristocratic or middle-class – which are the source of the founding of the first European Alpine Clubs. It attempts to follow the internal dynamics of each club in order to identify the process by which the rightful definition of the practice becomes the stake of debates and conflicts between diverging positions thus characterising the structuring of such a realm as a social area in its own right. It also has to take into account the impact of external factors such as specific socio-political contexts (construction of national cohesion, nature of political systems, border problems, etc.), or diverging life styles (importance of a classical education, of physical activities in leisure and in training the elites). The diverse opinions can be detected in distinct strategies aimed mainly at imposing a behaviour mountaineering mode compatible with ethical and aesthetic dispositions of the different groups competing to overtake the cultural realm of Alpine climbing.",

      "title": "Relational Inequalities",
      "abstract": "<italic>Relational Inequalities</italic> focuses on the organizational production of categorical inequalities, in the context of the intersectional complexity and institutional fluidity that characterize social life. Three generic inequality-generating mechanisms—exploitation, social closure, and claims-making—distribute organizational resources, rewards, and respect. The actual levels and contours of the inequalities produced by these three mechanisms are, however, profoundly contingent on the historical moments and institutional fields in which organizations operate. Organizational inequality regimes are comprised of the resources available for distribution; the task-, class-, and status-based social relations within organizations; formal and informal practices used to accomplish goals and tasks; and internal cultural models of people, work, and inequality, often adapted from the society at large to fit local social relationships. Legal and cultural institutions as they are filtered through workplace inequality regimes steer which groups are exploited and excluded, blocking or facilitating the conditions that lead to exploitation and closure. Sometimes exploitative and closure claims-making are naked and open for all to see; more often, they are institutionalized, taken for granted, and legitimated, sometimes even by those being exploited and excluded. The implications of RIT for social science and equality agendas are discussed in the conclusion. Case studies examine historical and contemporary workplace inequality regime variation in multiple countries. The role of intersectionality in producing regime variation is explored repeatedly across the book. Many occupations and industries are examined in depth, with particular attention given to engineers, CEOs, financial service, airlines, and information technology industries.",

      "abstract": "If we accept the notion of a learning society, it seems logical to conclude that some social arrangements promote learning more than others. It also follows that different social arrangements are likely to promote different types of learning. Most attempts to explore the Learning Society, and identify the different factors which promote lifelong learning, have focused on either the prospects facing individuals (particularly ‘access factors’ associated with entry into learning programmes or the barriers which prevent entry) or on the fate of nations and other large organisations (here, the focus tends to be on policy issues or the impact of external change factors). Our work within the ESRC Learning Society Programme1, while accepting the importance of both individual and macro levels, focused on what might be called the meso-level of institutional environments and the belief systems of those who inhabit and shape them. In particular, our work was concerned to find out whether patterns of participation and achievement in organised learning were associated with those intermediate relationships, shared values and habits known to some sociologists as ‘social capital’ (Bourdieu, 1985; Putnam, 1993; Coleman, 1994; Riddell et al, 1999).",

      "title": "(Dis)Empowering Migrant Parents in Nordic Education and Social Work",
      "abstract": "(Dis)Empowering Migrant Parents in Nordic Education and Social Work Keywords: welfare state, migration, empowerment, citizenship, democratic collaboration Internationally, the Nordic welfare states are renowned for their universalistic approaches to social rights and equal and free access to education and social services (Esping-Andersen 1990). However, this state benevolence comes with an ambiguous paternalism that seeks not only to educate children as future productive and active citizens, but also intervenes into parenting practices that are deemed inappropriate or counterproductive to pedagogical projects in education or social work (Moqvist 2003). According to Dahlstedt and Lozic, “[t]he formation of citizens is not only about fostering children to become certain kinds of subjects, it is also about enabling parents to raise their children in a ‘desired’ direction, i.e. they also need to be fostered as parents” (2017: 211). Interventions in parenting practices take shape in a professional complex of guidance, responsibilization, and normalization. Concurrently, such disciplining interventions have been woven into a tremendous democratization of the relationship between parents and educational institutions and social services since the 1970s (Bouakaz 2009; Dean & Villadsen 2016), e.g. appearing as dialogical approaches and partnerships. This political and professional attention paid to parents and parenting in relation to their children’s education seems to gain a more radical dimension in the case of migrant parents (Berg and Peltola 2015; Padovan-Özdemir and Moldenhawer 2016). Ever since the arrival of the first non-Western labour immigrants and refugees in the late 1960s, social and political rights have been increasingly premised on national sentiments of perceived cultural values and practices (Jöhncke 2011). This makes it harder for migrant parents to achieve recognition and full participation in so-called democratic partnerships and collaboration with educators and social workers, causing educators to sometimes morally condemn migrant parents as disengaged in their children’s education and, migrant parents experiencing inadequacy and impotence (Bouakaz 2009). Lately, the so-called refugee crisis has once again ignited political as well as professional debate about the integration of children with a migrant background – calling refugee parents’ parenting skills into question, especially in the case of parents who are not granted asylum but refuse or are unable to leave the country. Nevertheless, recent research seems to pave the way for more inclusive and democratic forms of collaboration with migrant parents in education and social work. According to Erel, Reynolds & Kaptani, an empowering potential can be found in approaching migrant parents’ “cultural work and their caring work, both within their families and in wider society” (2018: 69) as a way of practicing active citizenship, which can be used in democratic spaces of inclusive collaboration. This symposium has a threefold ambition. One, to explore and discuss critical and comparative perspectives on how Nordic welfare state regimes of education and social work address migrant parents and intervene in their parenting practices. Two, to provide new and more nuanced representations of migrant parents and their parenting practices and engagement in relation to their children’s education as sites of political struggle. Three, to pursue new and meaningful forms of democratic collaboration with migrant parents in Nordic education and social work. References Berg, P. and Peltola, M.

      "abstract": "Despite possessing a common history, language, culture and set of customs, the prolonged separation and ideological division of the Korean peninsula has gradually produced two distinctly different South and North Korean peoples with different ways of thinking and discrete behavior patterns. Therefore, elucidating the differences and the ways to overcome those differences is main prerequisite for Korean unification. In comparison with South Koreans, North Koreans are characterized as follows; 1) they are passive in their behavior. 2) they have a stronger feeling of solidarity with others who share resources evenly in their society, which causes no tension or competition; 3) They accept it as ordinary that one can speak out differently from their genuine mind due to political reasons; 4) they usually think that the major reason for success is not their own ability, but rather other factors such as their family origin; and 5) their leadership class, in particular, have highly goal-oriented minds. On the other hand, South Koreans are characterized as follows; 1) they have a strong tendency to evaluate people`s value and ability simply based upon their material worth; and 2) they lack reasonable sense of community. Therefore, when unification comes about, North Koreans are expected to have a number of difficulties; 1) severe anxiety, as freedom is not seen as a liberty, but a set of anxiety; 2) a great psychological burden, the level and intensity of which South Koreans cannot easily understand. 3) confusion of sense of value and authority. 4) a feeling of inferiority due to their relative poverty; and 5) confusion stemming from their misunderstanding of the concept of money. In order to overcome these differences and difficulties, several approaches are suggested in preparation for a successful reunification; 1) South and North Koreans need to redouble efforts to raise their common Korean national pride in spite of their ideological differences, as this common national pride will be main power to help overcome the difficulties of unification; 2) South and North Koreans need to create opportunities to meet together and share their emotional solidarity in as many as possible. 3) South Korea, in particular, needs to develop a more sound and reasonable capitalist system and the South Korean people need to lead a plain life which decreases the painful feeling of economic inferiority of the North Koreans after unification; 4) generation of South Koreans must be encouraged to carry out their unique role in the unification movement; and 5) unification requires the Korean people adopt a new a new value system of sharing and mutual respect.",

She could break the bubble that protects her and claimed her human quality because of her urge to improve to be able to show what she can bring to society. She is afraid of what the future will provide her and to lose all she has reached: her independence and her social integration",

      "title": "Literacy Identity Development",
      "abstract": "There is an extensive body of research that supports the notion that classrooms are microcosms of society that not only focus on academic activities but also serve as communities where 'social identities, power relations, and interpersonal struggles' occur (Cazden, John, and Hymes 1972; Gee 1989; Varenne and McDermott 1998, as cited in Wortham 2006). These non-academic events coupled with the many other social activities of students influence their identities. The body of research surrounding identity development and construction is rich and includes many disciplines - anthropology, psychology, social psychology, and sociology (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain 1998). The most recent trend in reading and literacy education is to determine ways in which literacy impacts or influences one's identity. Identity has been considered to be linked to language because it establishes a set of rules for communication that signals membership to a particular group (Gee 1990, as cited in McCarthey 2001). As national and state policies begin to focus more on adolescent literacy, there is a shift on the focus of literacy development. 'Adolescent literacy now moves beyond cognitive approaches and encompasses social and complex conceptions of literacy not limited to in-school literacy (Tatum 2006).' Research shows that identity matters as adolescents participate in a variety of meaningful literacy activities. The call is for educators to tap into students' literacy lives in order to make sense of how students use literacy in-and out-of-school.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the long-standing debate over the quest to achieve goals about social relationships via the neighborhood. Earlier in the 20th century, it was common for neighborhood proponents to ascribe social outcomes to neighborhoods in the hope that social connection—and at times, conformity—could be instilled, if only neighborhoods were of a particular form. Later in the century, communications and transportation technologies dealt a further blow to the idea that neighborhoods were a viable source for instilling social outcomes like a sense of belonging and a sense of community. The social prescriptions of neighborhood form have long been problematized, but the argument seems to linger on, fueling critics of neighborhood plans. The most promising avenue for resolving this entrenched debate is to reject outright social relationship–related claims, refocus attention on neighborhood functionality—services, facilities, and institutions—and welcome whatever positive social benefits might be derived.",

      "abstract": "Allow us instead to refer to the words of Giulio Maccacaro that appear in the dedication: though dating back to the '1970s, they are still very relevant today. First of all he argues that: There is no point in acquiring an abstract snapshot of the production process, what is needed is a real depiction of what each member of the working group experiences as his or her own personal condition. Not only for preventative purposes, but also for organizational and productive purposes, in order to truly comprehend a working environment: The traditional approach, based on the \"neutrality\", \"objectivity\", \"uniqueness\" of the production cycle and of the technology and science driving it, is no longer acceptable. This manual, therefore, seeks to offer methods, criteria, tools and procedures for understanding work and work-related risk, and for prioritizing the implementation of improvements, by specifically analzsing homogeneous groups: subjectivity not at the individual level but at the group level (i.e. collective subjectivity), globality along with simplicity and effectiveness in interpreting the results in order to satisfy real needs.",

      "abstract": "This chapter develops links between social behaviour and demography, and illustrates how knowledge of social behaviour may be used to manage populations for conservation. The chapter is necessarily speculative, both because the 'formal' field of conservation behaviour is still only a decade old, and because explicit applications of social management are still relatively uncommon. I summarise case studies where social behaviour has been manipulated to manage populations, and suggest possible ways that behaviour could be used to manage populations. After defining effective population size, I list a number of ways that social behaviour may influence it, via genetic variation, survival and reproductive success. Reproductive skew emerges from unequal reproduction, which may be caused by (among other things) social stress, reproductive suppression and infanticide. Social aggregation may reduce natural mortality, and the observations that animals seek conspecifics may be used as a management tool to attract individuals to protected locations. But conspecific attraction and social aggregation may also predispose a population to be vulnerable to human exploitation. Social factors (including reproductive opportunities) may drive dispersal and movements between groups. Humans can influence the structure of social relationships in animals, and these manipulations may influence group stability. Knowledge of these and other mechanisms arms managers with tools to manipulate the habitat or relationships to favourably influence social behaviour and structure, and thereby better manage a population.",

When programs fail to achieve goals or turn into outright fiascos, personal, organizational, and community pathology, or simply “politics” are common explanations. Problems are assumed to be endemic and intractable or remediable only by gifted leadership or transcendence of business as usual. This article argues that such thinking is rooted in a false assumption. “Community” needs to be reconceptualized as a community of organizations, not people, and organizations as constrained actors not analogous to individuals. Organizations interact in peculiar, but analyzable ways, giving rise to unanticipated outcomes that could be labeled pathology or mere politics. Community alcohol and other drug AOD programs might be more successful if their logic models were based on realistic concepts of community that can distinguish the actually political from the organizationally normal.",

      "title": "Evaluación de la creatividad en danza: un estudio comparativo del nivel de creatividad motriz en bailarines profesionales de cuatro estilos de danza",
      "abstract": "La sociedad de siglo XXI es una sociedad que evoluciona rapidamente y el ser humano debe aprender a adaptarse a todos estos cambios. Los ninos de hoy seran los adultos del manana y tendran que adecuarse a diversos trabajos, adoptar diversos roles sociales y desarrollar otras formas de emplear su tiempo libre (Trigo, 1997). Para ello, necesitan una educacion donde la creatividad tenga un papel destacado, que les permitan amoldarse a esas nuevas exigencias (Marin y De la Torre, 2000). La realidad educativa, sin embargo, nos indica que la memorizacion y la repeticion son los protagonistas de los aprendizajes de los alumnos/as (Robinson, 2006). \nEn el ambito de la danza, a nivel de formacion de bailarines en los conservatorios de danza, ocurre algo similar. La danza es, esencialmente, un vehiculo de expresion de emociones a traves del propio cuerpo, sin embargo,la memorizacion de coreografias y la repeticion de gestos tecnicos (Castaner, 2001), propicia que el alumno/a no transmita a traves de su propia sensibilidad el mensaje del coreografo. Tiende a repetir los patrones de respuestas motrices, limitando asi su capacidad de crear propuestas motrices propias. \nPara favorecer este tipo de creaciones, es necesario potenciar la capacidad creativa motriz del futuro bailarin, pero ?se desarrolla igual en todos los estilos de danza o esta influenciado por otros aspectos como el numero de asignaturas que en su curriculo abordan la creatividad o el proceso metodologico seguido en el aprendizaje de alguna de estas disciplinas? ?y como medimos la capacidad creativa de estos bailarines?\nEsta investigacion tiene como finalidad comprobar si existen diferencias en los niveles creativos en funcion del estilo de danza estudiado por los bailarines. Asi, se acomete el analisis de los niveles de creatividad que presentan profesionales de cuatro estilos de danza (danza clasica, danza contemporanea, danza espanola y baile flamenco), los cuales han terminado sus estudios en diferentes conservatorios profesionales de Andalucia.\nPara ello se ha elaborado un instrumento ad hoc basado en el Test de Brennan (1983). Las tres categorias tomadas de este modelo son: unidad, sistema y transformacion. El instrumento disenado, es una prueba que consta de cuatro tareas que favorecen la produccion y no tanto la reproduccion (aspecto habitual en danza), para asi estimular el pensamiento divergente en un ambiente conocido. Los niveles de analisis son dos: - Relacionado con las fases del proceso creativo (Guildford, 1971).\n- Relacionado con los contextos naturales (Anguera et al., 2001) de la danza (Laban, 1988). \nLas pruebas son grabadas y posteriormente evaluadas por tres jueces especialistas en cada uno de los estilos. Los resultados muestran la existencia de diferencias en los niveles de creatividad entre los estilos, destacando la danza contemporanea. Tambien pone de manifiesto que proponer un curriculo con mayor numero de asignaturas creativas, podria indicar cierta mejora en los valores obtenidos en los tres indicadores de la creatividad analizados, pero esta influencia parece estar mediatizada positiva o negativamente en funcion del estilo de ensenanza propio de cada estilo de danza. \nAlgunos de los autores referenciados en esta investigacion son: Anguera Ma .

However, Gordon's implied conclusion that social work can be defined by a broad value (i.e., self-realization) and a distinctive knowledge domain (i.e., social transactions) involves fundamental errors repeated in subsequent definitional attempts. Rather than being distinguished by a unique knowledge domain, social work, like other professions, must be defined by a value that is distinctive of the profession yet shared by all social work fields.",

      "title": "Managing individual and organizational challenges with respect to diversity perceptions and social capital among members of virtual teams",
      "abstract": "Diversity encompasses complex differences and similarities in perspectives, identities, and points of view among members of an institution as well as among individuals who make up the wider community. Diversity includes important and interrelated dimensions of human identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, socio-economic status, nationality, citizenship, religion, sexual orientation, ability and age. These differences are important to understand but they cannot be used to predict any individualâ€™s values, choices or responses.\r\nOrganizations with diverse employees are better suited to serve diverse external customers in an increasingly global market. Such organizations have a better understanding of the requirements of the legal, political, social, economic, and cultural environments. Organizations that manage\r\ndiversity are recipients of more commitment, and better satisfied as well as better performing employees (Patrick & Kumar, 2012).\r\nEnsuring better social relations among team members has become complex. The nature of teams is not how they used to be, organizations have spread across geographically which has led to the birth of virtual teams. Virtual team members are been separated by time and space this makes it even more difficult to ensure that social capital is being maintained among virtual team members, as only when there is a trust,\r\nreciprocity and cooperation among virtual team members they will be better connected individuals who obtain greater advantages, this ensures that groups and organizations improve performance and obtain sustainable competitive advantage (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998).\r\nThe present investigation was focused on understanding the perception of members of virtual teams towards diversity at workplace. This study assists us to find out how virtual team members can overcome Individual and Organizational Challenges towards diversity and to find out the social\r\nrelations among virtual team members, how much trust exists among them, how much virtual team members have clear understanding and perception of organizational goals and values; and how much they accept and are committed to them. The variables under investigation were Diversity Perception, Individual and Organizational challenges towards diversity and Social Capital.\r\nAmong the five dimensions of Diversity Perception the Behavioral Reactions was perceived highest by virtual team members followed by Emotional Reactions, Organizational Outcomes, Judgments and Personal Consequences. Virtual team members fairly perceived that Individual Challenges towards diversity can be overcome followed by Organizational Challenges towards diversity. Among the three dimensions of social capital Relational Dimensions were moderately\r\nperceived by virtual team members followed by Structural Dimension and Cognitive Dimensions. It was found that there is a significant relationship between Diversity Perceptions and Challenges towards Diversity. It was also found that there is a significant relationship between Diversity\r\nPerception and Social Capital. It was found that there is a significant relationship between Challenges towards Diversity and Social Capital. It was also found that there is a significant relationship between Social Capital and Interactions between Diversity Perceptions and Challenges\r\ntowards Diversity. It was found that there was a significant difference in Diversity Perception across marital status, gender, qualification and age. It was also found that there was a significant difference in Challenges towards diversity across qualification and age. It was also found that there\r\nwas a significant difference in Social Capital across marital status, gender and age. It was found that among the dimensions of Diversity Perceptions, Behavioral Reactions had a negative influence on Social Capital. \r\nIn order to enhance virtual team members Diversity Perception organizations should initiate Awareness-based diversity training; this training is designed to increase employee knowledge and sensitivity to diversity issues (Carnevale & Stone, 1995). In order to ensure better trust,\r\nsocial ties among virtual team members, organizations should inspire individuals to share their work with each other, reassure effective communication among the team members and assign them targets and ask their team members to contribute equally and achieve the target within the desired time frame this will assist virtual team members to overcome Challenges towards Diversity.\r\nTo make virtual team members overcome challenges towards diversity organizations should define what diversity is for them, they should be realistic when setting goals, involve everyone who has a responsibility for diversity, from the CEO to every virtual team member, and they should also manage virtual team membersâ€™ expectations. Diversity Challenges at the organizational level is complex and not every company will advance at the same pace. This will enable virtual team members to overcome Organizational level challenges towards Diversity, which will strengthen their Social Capital. Organizations should be empathetic among virtual team members, should acknowledge their needs and point of view as this remove the major barrier to communication (Pon, Pont, & Miller, 1999).This will indorse that virtual team members behave positively whenever they encounter Diversity. When challenges towards diversity\r\nare handled in a healthy way they make people to grow, improve their productivity and relationships, decrease workplace tension and results in a positive workplace (Holt, 2009). Studies show that when people understand diversity better they lead to better ties among the communities. When society have better understanding of diversity this allows them to see their differences and similarities and be better able to relate to one another (Ortiz, 2010).Virtual team members who have a greater understanding of Diversity have stronger social relations among colleagues as they recognize, understand and accept diversity of each other at workplace. Diverse workplace poses lesser problem if employees have regular, personal interactions with each other. That is, if employees have social ties with their colleagues, the diversity among them may not be as threatening to their level of interpersonal trust as for someone who works in a diverse workplace without such (Stolle, Soroka, & Johnston, 2008). Successful Diversity Management is essential for improved Social Capital.",

      "abstract": "The conditions of global change inevitably require further improvement of the mechanisms of social interaction and their regulation. Conscious unconventional management is part of a complex of factors and characteristics of subjectivity and sovereignty. The comprehensive realization of organizational-managerial reinforcement of creativity involves, first of all, the development of the environment for creativity (in particular, intellectual creativity), points of its concentration (for example, in the cluster form of scientific, educational and production associations), a picture of specialties, systems of continuous training (incl. retraining and self-education) creative activity. When faced with the \"historical challenges of the era,\" everyone either finds their own version of the answer to them (incl. entering the \"coordinate system\" of a more powerful subject), or tries to ignore changes [1-5]. It is obvious that the compliance of regulatory forms with socio-economic content is especially important when fixing the \"cornerstone\" of the society system: labour, property and interests. Meanwhile, any system of institutions during post-globalism cannot be considered as universal and the only possible one for humanity: everyone is unique in their own way, no one is exceptional. At the same time, the possibility of carefully borrowing some of the transformation models that are being developed by other peoples is increasing. The polystructure of world economic relations, based on mutually acceptable standards of relations, and not at all a block of identical atoms-elements, determine reality. Thus, from now on, organizational and managerial culture is based on diversification and diversity of the culture of activity, non-repressiveness, tolerance, polylogism, overcoming imposed canons, rejection of attempts at cultural regulation, \"celebration of resistance to the system\" [6-16].",

      "abstract": "The article describes social surfing as a new phenomenon, spreading very fast among the young people of the Russian society. This phenomenon finds its expression in superficial and diverse identifications of the youth with social communities. The results of the study, featuring value orientations of the youth (n = 568 respondents), were obtained with the help of the values questionnaire by S.H. Schwartz. It was found that among most of the respondents there was a significant discrepancy between the declared and real values which regulate individual behavior. This discrepancy is caused by an urgent need for security among various social communities and the lack of deep personal involvement in human social interaction, and by a focus on diversity of communication, which is superficial in its character. All this is brought about by the situation when classical social institutes have to a great extent lost their influence, when a person is no longer firmly attached to traditional communities such as family, confession and nation and loses touch with a concrete territory (region, town or country). In the global information environment a young person tries to become part of numerous social and cultural modifications and be “everywhere”. Traditional institutional forms are being replaced by communities of a new type which are characterized by lack of rigid ties: they are discrete, polimorphemic, open and always uncompleted. Post-traditional forms of interaction give young people a chance to easily pass from one community to another, to switch from one channel of communication to a different one and to search for and acquire various cultural practices. Man can easily become part of a social location by following only most evident ways of practice, by playing a fleeting game of “being somebody”, by presenting himself as a possible member.",

A literature search was conducted to identify studies in English published between January 2011 and July 2021. Twenty-eight documents met the inclusion criteria. Three key elements of community participation were identified: 1) social capital, 2) the way of using public space, and 3) community participation strategies. Community participation assists migrants in dealing with inequality, marginalization, and rural-urban adaptation in developing countries. Furthermore, it exercises a mediating role in solving community problems and alleviating tensions between migrants and locals in developed countries. Community participation also helps international migrants tackle cross-cultural/ethnic challenges and compensates internal migrants for institutional segregation. Overall, community participation can fulfill migrants' instant needs, expand their social network, and facilitate psychological integration; however, it does not necessarily contribute to social integration when the participation environment is biased and lacks meaningful encounters. Finally, three research gaps are highlighted: the distinction between integration into a migrant community and broader society, the degree of participation, and a gender perspective.",

      "title": "Communities and museums: equal partners?",
      "abstract": "Relationships between museums and communities take place within the context of complex national and local political agendas.1 They require museum practitioners to understand not only the specific economic, social and political contexts of their own institutions, but also to be aware of the ways in which communities themselves use museums as a means of expressing their identities and relationships with others. Such relationships involve negotiation and compromise on both sides but sometimes excite strong emotions that make dispassionate and impartial negotiations difficult. Museum professionals may become defensive of their expertise and reluctant to share control over knowledge, though eager to impart their own. Some communities, in turn, may be resistant to change in \"their museum,\" vesting energy in maintaining the status quo. Others demand new ways of practice and knowledge sharing and control that challenge a Western ideal of freedom of expression (Lagerkvist 2006), while some may have no understanding of how to work within the existing framework of knowledge and power that museums represent, and thus find themselves marginalized. Resistance to change by those familiar with the conventional performances of the museum space may be characterized as negative and reactionary while newer voices are welcomed. Those who were previously marginalized may, however, be as exclusive as some existing supporters. For many museum practitioners what results is a balancing act-policies that enable the museum and gallery to change and develop but ones which avoid confrontation with existing stakeholders. Over the last decade, or so, a great deal of attention has been paid to the ways in whichmuseums shape memory and identity. However, less emphasis has been placed on understanding the sophisticated ways in which groups of people, claiming to represent community interests, manage and control certain types of community resources such as gallery spaces, in order to maintain their sense of self-esteem and separateness from others, despite the best endeavors of museum practitioners to prevent this. There are some well-documented examples in which certain groups have successfully mobilized to oppose certain types of exhibition,such as the Enola Gay (e.g. Dubin 1999), and there are many examples of the questioning of Western knowledge principles by minority indigenous groups (e.g. Hooper-Greenhill 2000, Macdonald and Alsford 1995). However, there are, on the whole, fewer attempts to review and critique the ways inwhich communities in the West control the museum process to maintain their power over the institution in practice. It is in this context that this chapter seeks to understand some aspects of the work members of the Great Yarmouth museums team undertook over a seven-year period when, working in partnership with a range of organizations that included the National Trust, English Heritage and the local borough and county authorities, they sought to find new ways of working with different communities and new roles for the sites they managed, and to establish relationships with individuals who would not normally visit museums.2 During this period they conducted many different types of consultation exercises and used focus group work to help shape and develop all of the key developments in the town. This case study will explore the way in which certain groups, claiming to represent wider community interests, resisted change and, in so doing, maintained their privileged positions. It also examines how and why particular types of material culture and the ways they are made accessible are deemed to be particularly important to some community groups in the United Kingdom. This chapter also seeks to understand the relationship between theory and practice. A greatdeal has been written in academic discourse about museum relationships with communities that seeks to understand the ways in which institutional structures and practices inhibit, marginalize or exclude certain types of people (e.g. Bourdieu and Darbel 1997; Merriman 2000; Hooper-Greenhill 2000; Sandell 2002; Marstine 2006; Watson 2007a). What is less clear is the extent to which such theoretical approaches, even when rooted in specific case studies, actually help museums understand and manage their relationships with communities. Danielle Rice, writing about the art museum, argues that the relationship between most theorists and museum practice is non-existent to the extent that academics are concerned with an \"illusory museum\" (Rice 2003: 77). This, perhaps, rather overstates something that is, nevertheless, a dilemma for those working in and studying museums-the complex relationship between theory and practice-how to liberate theory from the abstract negotiation of ideas and apply it to the issues that relate to everyday museum practice. It also underestimates the impact upon museum practitioners of training in museological theory that encourages them to experiment and reflect on their theoretical understanding of museum work. What is often lacking is time for those working in museums to write about their experiences and reflect on them. The particular projects described here are now long over, so there is opportunity to think through some theoretical issues that might help explain how and why events unfolded as they did and the lessons learnt.",

He further says that he defines leadership as “selling an idea, concept, or vision so that people willingly follow. When it comes to Diversity &amp; Inclusion/D&amp;I, leaders must be clear about what they see as possible and what they want for their followers. The problem seems to be that too few leaders have a clear concept of diversity and inclusion.” He purposely does not use the term inclusion in this construct: “Notice that I use the term D&amp;I (diversity and inclusion). I introduced the term diversity management in the early 2000s as an indication that D&amp;I has the capacity to improve enterprise performance. I now encourage others to stick with the term D&amp;I and avoid the perpetual language roulette (changing terms without changing outcomes) and word salad (equity [E], belonging [B], justice [J], acceptance [A], empathy [E], etc.). The temptation to change the language when progress is elusive must be resisted.” In his words, D&amp;I is a change effort that includes the following competencies, which in his words are Change management, Conceptual clarity, Relationship building, Leadership skills, Strategy and execution, Trust building, and Language skills.",

      "title": "Levels of collaboration in local sports for all initiatives: management strategies and the role of the local sports administration",
      "abstract": "To date, the local authorities play an important role in the promotion of sports for all, but also the schools, sports clubs and other organizations contribute to this target. An effective sports policy needs a well-organized collaboration between different actors. Despite a growing body of knowledge about inter-organizational collaborations and public networks, knowledge about collaborations and networks in sports is limited (Babiak, 2007) and rather fragmented. As a response to the functional differentiation – several actors from different sectors are involved in a number of social problems - and the need for a more integrated approach for policy problems, a variety of collaborations exists in society (de Bruijn and ten Heuvelhof, 1995). To understand the nature and purpose of these collaborations, a clearly comprehensible taxonomy is convenient. A number of authors, including Mandell and Steelman (2003), provide a useful taxonomy to identify different types of collaborations. These collaborations differ among a variety of characteristics and range from a rather loose and noncommittal intermittent coordination, over a temporary task force and a permanent regulation to more lasting collaborations such as coalitions and networks. In our empirical study data were collected by a questionnaire in a sample of 78 local sports administrations in Flanders, who were involved in total in 398 collaborations. These collaborations were classified into the five different types according to the model of Mandell and Steelman (2003). Coalitions were the most frequent occurring type and networks the least. The average number of partners in the collaborations were 2,5, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 9 partners. Based on this taxonomy, our paper describes the role of the local sport administrations in the promotion of sports for all and provides a suggestion on how to manage these specific types of collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Face a une situation de crise sanitaire liee a l’apparition d’une pandemie de grande envergure, des mesures adequates doivent rapidement etre prises pour la contenir tout en preservant la capacite de production de l’economie. D’autre part, beaucoup de travaux sont realises dans le domaine de la diffusion de la propagation d’une epidemie. C’est pourquoi, nous accentuons notre apport a un decideur afin de lui permettre de maintenir les fonctions minimums de survie de la societe dans le cadre d’une crise sanitaire. Ainsi, nous proposons un modele d’aide a la decision de gestion de crise sanitaire. Par ailleurs, la societe est situee au coeur de notre modele. Nous sommes donc amenes a considerer un certain nombre d’interactions directes et indirectes entre divers individus. La theorie des graphes, et principalement les graphes aleatoires, permettent de gerer une a une ces relations. Or, dans notre cas, la gestion des relations une a une n’est pas appropriee d’autant plus que les relations peuvent varier sous l’influence de facteurs incontrolables. Cela nous a conduits a proposer un modele mathematique de reseaux stochastiques base sur une extension de la theorie des graphes aleatoires. Il s’agit de la pretopologie stochastique qui est issue du couplage de deux theories mathematiques fondamentales, la pretopologie classique et les ensembles aleatoires. La simulation de notre modele est effectuee selon une approche multi-agents. Nous avons opte pour cette approche car nous souhaitons mettre en place un modele d’aide a la decision. Cette methode va donc nous permettre de faire des simulations et des analyses de sensibilites. Nous avons une representation explicite des comportements des individus qui ne sont pas figes. Situee entre la theorie et l’ensemble des donnees de l’experience, l’approche multi-agents permet de prendre en compte de maniere simultanee les comportements individuels, les interactions entre les individus et les hypotheses dynamiques formulees dans le modele. Cette approche sera couplee au systeme d’information geographique afin de considerer l’aspect spatial. Considere comme un « oignon », le systeme d’information geographique permet d’exploiter differentes donnees et de les superposer sous forme de couches. Disposant de donnees epidemiologiques provenant des Groupes Regionaux d’Observation de la Grippe (GROG) et des donnees sociodemographiques issues de l’Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE), nous pourrons tester la robustesse de notre modele.",

      "abstract": "Perilaku seseorang selalu menjadi bahasan menarik, karena perilaku seseorang\r\nmenjadi ukuran bagaimana seseorang itu dapat dikatakan mempunyai moral. Perilaku\r\nseseorang dapat dikatakan baik jika sesuai dengan koridor norma agama dan sosial,\r\nbegitu sebaliknya jika perilaku bertentangan dengan norma agama dan sosial, maka\r\ndapat dikatakan perilaku itu menyimpang. Dalam sosiologi, perilaku menyimpang\r\nadalah perilaku yang tidak sesuai dengan norma dan nilai yang dianut masyarakat.\r\nPerilaku menyimpang adalah benturan ketidak sesuaian (konformitas) dengan norma\r\nsosial ataupun value yang sudah mengkristal pada masyarakat, sehingga direaksi oleh\r\nmasyarakat berupa sanksi. Secara umum, macam-macam penyimpangan perilaku\r\nyang terjadi dalam masyarakat, seperti madat, minum, main, maling, dan madon,\r\nyang kemudian dalam masyarakat jawa populer dengan sebutan MO-LIMO. Perilaku\r\nmenyimpang menjadi permasalahan yang perlu dicarikan solusinya mengingat\r\nperilaku ini menghambat stabilitas sosial. Perilaku menyimpang bisa menyerang\r\nsiapa saja tanpa membedakan tua ataupun muda. Di kampung Tegal Kopen\r\npenyimpangan perilaku juga terjadi, halnya berjudi dan minum-minuman keras.\r\nMelihat problematika di atas, masyarakat pada awalnya kurang peduli dengan catatan\r\ntidak menggangu namun, perilaku berjudi dan minum-minuman keras membuat\r\nkeresahan dalam masyarakat sehingga masyarakat bertindak untuk mengatasi\r\nproblematika ini.\r\nMelihat perilaku yang demikian, maka harus dilihat keadaaan sosial di kampung\r\nTegal Kopen dan faktor yang mengakibatkan perilaku mereka berubah. Keadaan\r\nsosial di kampung Tegal Kopen bermacam-macam, begitu pula faktor yang\r\nmengakibatkan mereka berubah. Melihat hal tersebut, digunakan metode sosiologi\r\ntentang tindakan sosial Max weber, Talcot Parson, beserta kesadaran Sigmund freud\r\nnamun, pada teori kesadaran lebih ditekankan efek yang mempengaruhinya.\r\nBentuk keadaan sosial di kampung Tegal Kopen meliputi; pertama perilaku, seperti\r\nberjudi dan mabuk. kedua agama dan ketiga interaksi. Sedangkan faktor yang\r\nmempengaruhi perubahan perilaku, yakni tindakan warga berupa laporan ke POLRI\r\ndan dilanjutkan tindakan kepolisian. Warga juga mempunyai tindakan lain, yakni\r\nhimbauan, pendekatan, dan agama. Selain itu, adanya kesadaran pribadi. Kesadaran\r\nini tumbuh dari pikiran sendiri dan adanya kontak sosial yang mempengaruhi mereka.\r\nKesadaran membuat mereka berubah secara totalitas sehingga perilaku berjudi dan\r\nmabuk tidak terulang kembali hingga saat ini. Di samping kesadaran, tindakan warga\r\njuga mempunyai andil dalam membentuk sistem sosial sehingga perubahan perilaku\r\nyang di idealkan dapat terealisasi. Selanjutnya, penulis tidak menemukan perbuatan\r\njudi dan miras di kampung Tegal Kopen. Untuk permainan kartu remi masih ada dan\r\nperlu ditegaskan, dalam bermain kartu remi tidak menggunakan uang, hanya yang\r\nkalah dan menang mereka catat disebuah kertas. Hal tersebut guna mendapatkan\r\nsanksi, biasanya berupa mengocok kartu.",

      "title": "Voluntary Associations, the Homeless and Hard-to-Serve Populations-Perspectives from Organizational Theory",
      "abstract": "In order to assess the role volunteers play and might be expected to play in provision for the homeless and other populations which resist involvement and providing personal information as features of being helped, selected perspectives from organi zational literature are used to: (1) pose the dilemma presented to service providers and programs by these populations; and (2) seek organizational models which might prove appropriate for serving them. Seeking \"solutions\" in conventional, large-scale programming runs into the dilemma that detailed information flows from the client are necessary to assure accountability, undergird evaluative efforts or even to provide professional service on the one hand, and that unwillingness to provide such information or to comply with routines is a common characteristic of many components of the homeless population on the other. Because the homeless are composed of a number of unlike subpopulations, a typology is suggested to arrange them according to characteristics relevant to the kinds of service organization which might prove effective. The typology is based on whether the service system can provide needed services and whether the client can accept them as provided. Also, general organizational types for conventional service delivery are drawn from Mintzberg and Hasenfeld and English. The idea of mediating institutions which serve to bring the activities of large-scale institutions to a human scale for individu als and to insulate them from undesired involvement with the general society is explored. Forms of organizational experience which might provide models for deal ing with the hard-to-serve are sought in classical charities, counterculture organi zations and providers of emergency services. Hard-to-serve populations emerge as an especially important arena for the efforts of volunteers for a number of reasons: (1) the needs of the clients are concrete and essential and detailed training is not necessary to help them; (2) help is essential to immediate physical survival and must go on whatever the fortunes of more abstract program or policy efforts, making them attractive to those volunteers who prefer direct contact with people helped; (3) because the organizations involved tend to be small, heterogeneous and localized, activity within them presents a broad range of auspices and work appealing to a number of motivations; (4) there is often a direct connection to religious and other institutional areas of the volunteer's life; and (5) because the organizations are small and the activities direct, results are immediately perceptible.",

      "abstract": "To successfully address issues of oppression, anti-oppressive interventions have to encompass social relations at the personal, organisational and cultural levels, although a social worker may concentrate a particular involvement primarily on one of these. Social workers tend to work with individuals and include others when it seems necessary. Thus, securing individual change by working with individuals in therapeutic relationships has been a key aspect of practice. Traditionalists or proponents of the maintenance school of social work have worked with individuals in the hopes of getting them to adopt accepted social norms, and pathologising them when their endeavours fail.",

      "abstract": "Disability is an umbrella term covering not only impaired physical structure or function, but also activity and participation limitation in performing everyday tasks (1,2). It is estimated that 1 in 10 persons suffers from some kind of invalidity or disability, making it an important global public health problem (1). Since various concepts have been used to describe people with disabilities, in 1980 the World Health Organization (WHO) published the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (1), which gives a more detailed description of the 3 key concepts. Impairment involves any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function. Disability results from impairment and is defined as any restriction or lack of capability to perform activities in a way or within the range considered normal for a human being, while handicap results from an impairment and/or a disability and limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role of an individual in the society and/or social integration, depending on age, sex, and cultural and social factors (1,2). In 2001, the WHO published the new International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (3), which specified 4 categories: physical functions, physical structures, domains of activity, and participation, with environmental factors. The ICF points out that the relation between health and disability is the result of interaction between factors of the mentioned categories. In the Republic of Croatia, several legal definitions of disability are used; one of the definitions, which corresponds the WHO classification from 2001, states that a disabled person is the person with physical, sensory or mental damage, which at least for a period of one year or permanently leads to reduced ability of satisfying personal needs in everyday life (4).",

Likewise the word has entered the common parlance of church-life. One constantly hears discussions of the desire of congregations to connect with their local “communities” (and the accompanying designing and implementation of programs to bring this about) and the expressed aspiration to build a clearer sense of “community” within the church itself.",

      "abstract": "Adjustment is an important phenomenon in the life of human. The process of adjustment is continuous. It starts at one’s birth and goes on without stop till one’s death. Adjustment means reaction to the demands and pressures of social environment imposed upon an individual. Pathak (1990) said that adjustment is a built in mechanism for coping with the problematic or other realities of life. It has been considered as an index of integration; a harmonious behavior of the individual by which other individuals of society recognize that the person is well adjusted. Adjustment is a subjective wellbeing which involves a multidimensional evaluation of life including cognitive judgments of life satisfaction and affective evaluations of emotions and moods (McGillivray and Clarke, 2006). A person feels adjusted when his physical, psychological and social needs are satisfied. These needs may be in field of home, school and the society in which the individual be longs. The process of adjustment is continuous. It is a two way process and involves not only the process of fitting oneself into available circumstances but also the process of changing the circumstances to fit one’s needs. The process of adjustment depends upon certain char acteristics of the environment. So the environment must be such that it is possible for an individual to satisfy his basic organic needs. Ma and Xu (2004) showed the achievement demonstrated casual predominance over adjustment across the entire secondary school. Gender difference in this causal relationship was not found but elite status in mathematics moderated this causal relationship. Shalu &",

      "title": "National identity: Conceptual models, discourses and political change",
      "abstract": "Cognitive Linguistics has demonstrated the applicability of a conceptual approach to the understanding of political issues, cf. Lakoff (2008) and many others. From a different perspective, critical discourse analysis has approached political concepts with a focus on issues involving potentially divisive features such as race, class, gender and ethnic identity. Although discourses are not identical to conceptual models, conceptual models are typically manifested in discourse, and discourses are typically reflections of conceptualizations, a theme explored e.g. in Hart and Lukes (2007). As argued in Harder (2010), however, both the analytic stance of critical discourse analysis (based on the hermeneutics of suspicion), and the cognitivist stance of Lakoff (2008) are too narrow: The understanding of political language requires a wider framework of social cognitive linguistics. Essential features of such a framework are a basis in collaborative intersubjectivity and the inclusion of causal factors in the social domain that impinge on conceptualization. This enables politically salient conceptualizations to be understood in the light of different types of input to conceptualization, rather than solely in terms of conceptual models or discourses. This is especially important in cases that involve conflictive political issues such as national and ethnic identity. The article reports on a historical project with a linguistic dimension in my department (PI Stuart Ward, cf. Ward 2004), which aims to throw light on the interplay between conceptual, geopolitical and social factors in shaping the ongoing change in the role and nature of ‘Britishness’. A key question for this article is: What are relations between conceptual models and macro-social, causal factors in shaping the intersubjective status of Britishness?",

Little evidence of such benign processes can be seen however in the lives of patients seeking help, perhaps because these are for the most part little capable of taking advantage of naturally occurring social opportunities. Social phobia typically crystallizes as a pattern in the face of the increasingly insistent social and interpersonal demands of adulthood made on adolescents, and remains among the most chronic problems seen in the clinic (see chapter 5). Help is often sought long after the onset of problems. What of proven value can be offered such patients?",

Quite a number of principal questions is aroused by the analogy, or in other words apparent technological proximity between the everyday commercial advertising and obtrusive political agitation. In the end it leads to one of the facets of the perennial problem of social person: how and to what extent the man is willing to yield to the pressure of communication media of mass hitting. Mass (as the subject to communication's impact, including commercial advertising and political agitation) in some respect is similar to crowd. But the similarity of some components of action or elementary psychological structures does not mean identity of social mechanisms and types of action. The very existence of social phenomenon of is conditioned by the high development of systems of production and consumption. And besides, both by origin and nature, masses are not a continuation of crowd but rather a supplement to social organisation, a sort of superstructure over it. In post-Soviet society the tools of competition, advertising and marketing are intermingled with the Soviet legacy of monopolistic social system. It is also apparent in the areas of social and political advertising, communication, and public opinion. Thus, the electoral process of the spring and summer of 1996 was not as much competitive struggle as political mobilisation. In the course of electoral campaign, as surveys show, the main part was played by rational factors of choice, while voters emulated rather an imaginable majority of the population than the immediately known to them moods of their local co-residents. Advertising can serve as a paradigm of masscommunicative influence. Meanwhile, similarity of the advertising methods in use is possible due to expansion of advertising impact into elementary components. Use of some general frameworks of understanding the and processes seems to be important under the present conditions for overcoming illusory notions of man and society.",

Prohibited from burying their brother, Antigone and Ismene step outside the gates of the city to speak in private. Caught between the force of law and the faith of love, they argue over whether dissent can remake the collective order in the name of justice. Their disagreement is familiar. As bequeathed by modernity, the concept of the public sphere refers broadly to a deliberative arena in which individuals employ consensual forms of communication to develop a collective political will. This construction of the commons is both important and troublesome. Public deliberation can yield norms of material equality, democratic representation, and justice. However, experience teaches that public consensus-building is not always realistic or desirable. For one, modern society is not [End Page 336] a \"natural\" wellspring of mutual agreement. Among others, James Bohman (1996) in a recent study of public deliberation finds that \"deep conflicts\" frequently challenge the ability of citizens to find common ground, engage in deliberation, and reach consensus. What's more, principled commitments to consensus have been used to buttress a public sphere that trades human creativity, expression, and pluralism for rigidity, silence, and ideology. 1",

      "abstract": "The book by Emmanuel Renault, professor of philosophy of the Ecole Normale Superieure of Lyon, presents an interesting and wide-ranging survey of recent studies of the concept of social suffering, based on philosophy, psychology and political science. The term social suffering (in the singular or plural) is widely used today in the social sciences, covering different aspects related to a loss in the quality of life, experienced both at individual level (psychopathological symptoms deriving from inhumane working conditions, unemployment or job instability, for example) and collective level (social unease, degradation of the living conditions of communities, situations of domination, social exclusion, violence, psychological harassment, etc.). The term is also evoked in political debates on the actions taken by society or public policies to identify the problems related to the living conditions or social exclusion of certain sectors of the population. In these debates, social suffering is frequently associated with the recent effects of neoliberalism, in particular increased job instability and the limitations imposed on social security for wage-earners and the unemployed. Although social suffering has existed in various societies and historical periods (suffering linked, for example, to the situation of workers with the onset of industrialization in 19th century Europe, slavery in colonized countries, forced labour or other authoritarian practices), the intensive use of the corresponding concept in the social sciences is fairly recent. In the French context, one author who contributed considerably to its divulgation is Christophe Dejours, a work psychologist who at the end of the 20th century investigated the Michel Thiollent",

He defined the person involved in using two languages as bilingual. Bilingualism is common throughout the world and results from various language contact situations including: (1) colonization – colonizer imposition of a language different from the native language; (2) residing in officially bilingual countries (e.g., Canada, where English and French are official languages, and Finland, where Finnish and Swedish are official languages); (3) growing up in a bilingual household where caretakers use two different languages; and (4) migrating to a new society where immigrants often continue to use their native language at home while learning the host country's dominant language and using it in official institutions. Bilingualism can occur at either the individual or societal level and can be examined using a variety of disciplinary lenses. For example, individual bilingualism is examined via disciplines such as neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and psycholinguistics. Societal bilingualism is studied by researchers representing various disciplines such as sociology, the sociology of language, sociolinguistics, and anthropology.",

De hecho, en las últimas décadas se han observado casos de zoonosis, uso inadecuado de recursos, deterioro del ambiente y un aumento de casos registrados de abuso animal. El abuso animal, fenómeno complejo y multideterminado, frecuentemente funciona como precursor o indicador de otras conductas calificadas como “antisociales”, violentas y no violentas. Respecto del rol que juega la empatía en la emisión o inhibición de conductas agresivas y de cuán generalizable es la empatía interespecie, existe evidencia contradictoria y se resaltan aquí tres fenómenos de interés: erosión empática, desensibilización progresiva a la violencia y fatiga por compasión. Objetivo: determinar si los niveles de empatía, la disposición a comportarse de manera abusiva contra otros animales y la conducta efectiva de abuso animal se relacionan con el contexto de formación preprofesional, el género autopercibido y la tenencia actual y/o previa de animales de compañía en estudiantes universitarios que cursan el tramo final de la Licenciatura en Psicología. Metodología: diseño ex post facto retrospectivo de grupo único (N = 241). Se aplicó un cuestionario autoadministrado que incluyó el Interpersonal Reactivity Index, la Animal Empathy Scale, la Animal Abuse Proclivity Scale y la cantidad y frecuencia de conductas efectivas de abuso animal.
