      "title": "Headaches Associated with Head Trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Post concussive headache (PCH) is a new headache that follows a blunt or open injury to the head or brain (Headache Classification Committee, 2004). Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "The idea that loss of neurons could be associated with disease states and that certain microscopic appearances could be indicative of these arose in the mid to late 1800s. If neurons die, become dysfunctional, or are disconnected following a challenge, functionality of the affected neural circuit is compromised. Depending on the magnitude and localization, this may have relatively mild consequences (such as a learning deficit) or major consequences (such as developmental delay, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or death). We are interested in selective or regional neuron death because they can help to explain the neurologic dysfunction experienced by an individual or give insight into the pathologic process that preceded death.",

Parasomnias are unusual behaviors occurring during sleep: arousal disorders; sleep-wake transition disorders; disorders associated with rapid eye movement sleep; and other disorders.

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Extract Introduction Injury to the brain and spinal cord after cardiac surgery represents a significant cause of morbidity and disability. Neurological complications increase the length of ICU and hospital stay, and reduce the likelihood of return to independent living. Minor neurological complications are very common and often go undiagnosed. It is now recognized that transient and early postoperative problems such as confusion, agitation, and delirium – previously considered self-limiting nuisances – are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a decline in cognitive function in the early postoperative period is predictive of late (five-year) cognitive decline. General considerations Clinical spectrum The spectrum of central nervous system injury during and after cardiac surgery encompasses a wide range of clinical entities ranging from death or persistent vegetative state to subtle changes in memory and concentration: Neurological injury may be: immediate – apparent soon after the patient recovers from anaesthesia; or delayed – with onset after a...",

Any individual who presents with cognitive decline following a history of concussion should undergo a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation, and this should be coupled with a detailed medical and neurological exam to assess for all possible causes of impaired cognition.

      "title": "Dynamique de l’excitabilité corticale dans l’épilepsie-absence et intégration sensorielle",
      "abstract": "Une crise d’epilepsie resulte de la survenue soudaine d’une activite neuronale anormalement intense, rythmique et synchrone dans une region plus ou moins etendue du systeme nerveux central. Les consequences cliniques sont extremement variees, selon les zones cerebrales affectees et la duree des crises, allant de breves secousses musculaires tres focalisees a une perte de conscience complete, eventuellement associee a des convulsions. Dans le cas de l’epilepsie-absence, une epilepsie generalisee d’origine genetique survenant frequemment chez les enfants, les crises s’expriment essentiellement par une suspension des processus conscients dans toutes leurs dimensions, y compris une interruption des perceptions conscientes. Ces symptomes sont correles a des decharges de pointes-ondes (DPO) dans les electroencephalogrammes (EEG) bilateraux. Les mecanismes physiopathologiques des alterations de conscience au cours des crises d’epilepsie-absence restent l’objet de debats intenses, opposant des alterations fonctionnelles a grande echelle a un filtrage des informations exogenes par les oscillations epileptiques. Au cours de mes recherches, j’ai explore l’hypothese alternative, mais non exclusive, d’un dysfonctionnement dynamique dans les processus d’integration sensorielle au sein des circuits thalamo-corticaux primaires. Des explorations electrophysiologiques fines n’etant pas realisables chez les enfants epileptiques, j’ai utilise un modele genetique presentant une forte homologie avec la pathologie humaine : le Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). En combinant in vivo des enregistrements electrocorticographiques (ECoG) et intracellulaires dans le cortex somatosensoriel primaire (S1), precedemment identifie comme le site de declenchement des crises, j’ai d’abord analyse les proprietes integratives et d’excitabilite des neurones pyramidaux du cortex S1, durant et en dehors des crises, et je les ai comparees a celles des neurones homologues chez des rats non epileptiques. J’ai montre que ces neurones presentent lors des periodes inter-ictales une excitabilite accrue, s‘exprimant par une augmentation de la decharge des neurones en reponse a des stimulations excitatrices d’intensite croissante ainsi qu’une tendance exacerbee a se re-polariser suite a une hyperpolarisation de grande amplitude, suggerant un accroissement du courant cationique h. Au cours des crises, les memes neurones montraient des changements differentiels dans leur excitabilite membranaire selon la composante pointe ou onde dans l‘ECoG correspondant. La pointe etait associee a une augmentation de decharge evoquee par un courant depolarisant et a une diminution de resistance membranaire. Symetriquement, l’onde etait correlee avec une augmentation de resistance membranaire et une diminution d’excitabilite. Ces changements dynamiques des proprietes integratives neuronales suggerent une instabilite des reponses corticales lors du cycle pointe-onde pouvant « brouiller » les signaux sensoriels lors des crises. J’ai teste cette hypothese en analysant les reponses des neurones corticaux, et des neurones thalamo-corticaux correspondants, a des stimulations appliquees sur les vibrisses controlaterales. Bien que les reponses synaptiques induites dans les neurones du cortex S1 par les stimulations sensorielles n’etaient pas globalement alterees lors des crises, elles etaient plus amples et plus efficaces pour declencher des potentiels d’action pendant l’onde compare a la composante pointe. Cet accroissement relatif de la reponse neuronale lors de l’onde ECoG resulte probablement de l’accroissement de resistance membranaire precedemment decrit, d’une augmentation de la force electromotrice des courants synaptiques glutamatergiques et de la forte probabilite de decharge des neurones thalamiques correspondants lors de cette composante.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

Loss of short-term memory and coordination are the two primary deficits that occur after concussion.

      "abstract": "Neurological assessment of critically ill patients requires physical examination although coexisting cognitive impairment, sedative or paralytic medication, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular weakness, injuries or surgery involving extracranial tissues may limit sensitivity and specificity of findings. Notwithstanding these constraints, neurological signs and syndromes are valuable indicators of severity of illness and prognosis. Common neurologic syndromes in ICU patients include disturbances in the level of arousal and in cognition, delirium, seizures, generalized weakness, and focal neurological deficits. Whenever possible, neurological examination should include an assessment of mental status, attention, cranial nerves, motor and sensory findings. If there is persisting diagnostic uncertainty additional testing should be sought. Computed tomography of the head should be obtained whenever there is a new onset of seizures, focal neurologic deficits, alteration of mental status or loss of consciousness which are not immediately reversible or explainable. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for demyelinating and inflammatory diseases, hyperacute ischemic stroke, microhemorrhagic lesions, anoxic-ischemic damage, and disorders affecting the white matter and the brainstem. Electroencephalography is needed if seizures or status epilepticus are suspected as a cause or consequence of acute brain dysfunction. Somatosensory evoked potentials, best studied in patients with anoxic brain injury may help with prognostication following cardiac arrest. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities should be obtained when neuromuscular weakness is severe or cannot be assessed clinically.",

      "abstract": "The location of single strategic infarcts and the cognitive impairment after a stroke reect the neuroanatomy of the brain's cognitive functions. Poststroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSD/PSCI) is a form of cognitive disturbance caused by cerebrovascular disease that can manifest at different times after a stroke, including during the acute phase of stroke, during the recovery phase (while motor stroke symptoms improve), or months and years later. The onset of cognitive impairment depends on the location of infarct. Infarct in certain locations have cognitive impairment as a sole presentation from the outset. Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left thalamus are notably correlated with cognitive impairment following a stroke. In the former, patients present with complains of motor difculties as the main complain. In addition to these locations, vascular lesions in the thalamo-perforating area of the PCAmay cause dementia and other forms of severe memory loss. Abaseline (pre-morbid) and early post-stroke (early post-morbid) cognitive status should be evaluated and a protocol for the same is needed in regular clinical and ICU care facilities. MoCA assessment is commonly used for cognitive assessment. Its role in strategic infarcts is undermined as it leaves out the evaluation of symptoms corresponding to common strategic infarct locations such as the medial temporal lobe and thalami. There is a need for dedicated neuropsychological assessment score based on education level, and native-language for PSCI.",

Other indirect neurological consequences are traumatic brain and spinal cord injury secondary to a fall after the electrical injury. Neurologists may be less familiar with delayed spinal cord damage and a clinical picture such as a lower motor neuron syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or transverse myelitis – days or decades following the electrical injury. Even rarer, and the focus of this article, is what has been referred to as diffuse electrical injury where there are diffuse symptoms, both ‘path related’ and remote to the theoretical current pathway (the linear path of the electrical current from entry point to exit point).

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

The injuries sustained from such a blow can alter brain function and result in a variety of symptoms including difficulty thinking clearly, fuzzy or blurry vision, extreme irritability, and/or balance and coordination issues. Current neurological exams used to diagnose concussions involve an assessment of the patient's eye response to acute stimuli, in addition to concentration and memory exercises to test the functional ability of the brain. The methodology used to diagnose a concussion can be improved upon for better accuracy and a more clear diagnosis. The proposed change to the concussion diagnostic process involves the use of an eye-tracking apparatus to measure the severity of the injury through saccadic movements in the eyes.",

      "title": "Perioperative Management of Acute Central Nervous System Injury",
      "abstract": "Neural function is essential to human existence. Thus, loss of any neural element in the course of a critical illness represents a major loss to a given individual. Neurons or supporting elements may be lost in a small, virtually unnoticeable manner, perhaps manifest as cognitive or behavioral deficit, or there may be widespread selective neuronal loss or tissue infarction with more apparent and disabling deficits. Based on the notion that neural function is the essence of acceptable survival from critical illness, it is crucial for perioperative management to include considerations of neural viability and the impact and interactions of the primary diseases and therapeutics on the nervous system. There are numerous perioperative scenarios where a patient may present with neurologic dysfunction. In a general sense, these scenarios often involve ischemia, trauma, or neuroexcitation. Each of these, as they progressively worsen, at some point typically involve a period of decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), usually resulting from elevated intracranial pressure, eventually compromising cerebral blood flow sufficiently to produce permanent neuronal loss, infarction, and possibly brain death. A variety of biochemical pathways play a major role. Optimization of perioperative outcome after injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is a multifactorial process requiring skillful and well-informed anesthetic and critical care management. However, none of these interventions is risk-free, and extensive knowledge and expertise are very important to ensure a fine balance between the benefits and risks of specific interventions. By the end of this chapter, the anesthesia provider should have a general understanding of how to address the most commonly encountered complications in the acutely injured central nervous system.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe and may have long-term consequences including visual difficulties, cognitive deficits, headache, pain, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic epilepsy. Disruption of the normal functioning of the brain leads to a cascade of effects with molecular and anatomical changes, persistent neuronal hyperexcitation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Destructive processes that occur at the cellular and molecular level lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation, and apoptosis. Vascular damage, ischemia and loss of blood brain barrier integrity contribute to destruction of brain tissue. This review focuses on the cellular damage incited during TBI and the frequently life-altering lasting effects of this destruction on vision, cognition, balance, and sleep. The wide range of visual complaints associated with TBI are addressed and repair processes where there is potential for intervention and neuronal preservation are highlighted.",

Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "abstract": "WHAT IS ENCEPHALOPATHY?Encephalopathy is a clinical state characterised by an alteration of consciousness, behaviour and/or cognition.It can present with lethargy and drowsiness, or conversely with a heightened state of agitation and confusion.It arises from diffuse brain dysfunction that can result from myriad underlying conditions, ranging from primary neurologic to systemic disorders.While encephalopathy more commonly stems from a global brain insult, it can present with a range of focal neurological manifestations such as seizures, visual disturbances, speech abnormalities, motor weakness, and sensory and autonomic deficits.Encephalitis refers specifically to brain inflammation, usually associated with fever, with evidence of cerebrospinal inflammation (pleocytosis and raised protein levels) and/or neuroimaging findings of encephalitis. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE?Altered behaviour is common in children and has many causes.In the general clinic setting, it is important to pick up common clinical mimics of encephalopathy that can be managed without immediate referral to the hospital.These include post-ictal drowsiness from simple febrile seizures, and metabolic derangements such as hypoglycaemia.Conversely, it is also important to identify red flags in the history and physical examination that necessitate either activation of emergency services or an urgent referral to the neurologist for further workup.In particular, encephalitis accounts for a significant proportion of encephalopathy cases that persist beyond 24 hours, and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.(3) Arriving at an accurate diagnosis for the underlying cause is critical because many causes are reversible, and early specific treatment confers a better prognosis.",

Transient visual symptoms can likewise be a harbinger of stroke and prompt rapid evaluation for the prevention of recurrent stroke. A carotid artery disease can manifest as transient monocular visual loss (TMVL), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). Stroke posterior to the optic chiasm can cause sectoranopias, quadrantanopias, or hemianopias, which can be either congruous or incongruous. Any stroke involving the dorsal stream (occipito-parietal lobe), or ventral stream (occipito-temporal lobe) can manifest with visuospatial perception deficits. Similarly, different ocular motility abnormalities can result from a stroke affecting the cerebrum, cerebellum, or brainstem. Among these deficits, vision and perception disorders are more difficult to overcome. Clinical, experimental, and neuroimaging studies have helped us to understand the anatomical basis, physiological dysfunction, and the underlying mechanisms of these neuro-ophthalmic signs.",

      "abstract": "Most sports related injuries are musculoskeletal, affecting limbs or trunk, and related to specific risks associated with particular sports. Head injuries by contrast can occur in many sports and, except those incurred during boxing, are accidental. Unlike other injuries, the effects of which are usually maximal at onset, injury to the head may precipitate a process of intracranial disorder that can convert a mild initial injury into a life threatening condition from secondary complications. Moreover, even mild injuries are often associated with considerable temporary disability, and repeated mild injuries can result in cumulative brian damage. Doctors on sports fields have to decide whether patients with head injury can resume play or, if not, what further immediate management is needed and when they can play again. The answers to these questions depend on a sensible balancing of risks.\n\nIt is damage to the brain that matters when the head is hit. Injuries to the scalp or skull are important only as indicators of the possibility of underlying impact damage or of the risk of complications that could cause secondary brain damage. Either impact or secondary brain damage may be diffuse or focal, and this will influence the clinical features.\n\n(1) Cerebral contusions - Bruising on the brain surface due to the brain's impact with the overlying skull - are the commonest form of impact damage. Contusion may be focal underneath a fracture resulting from a focal impact, blunt or penetrating, or it may be diffuse, resulting from the brain as a whole being thrown against the rough interior surface of the skull and dural dividers. Diffuse contusion results when the head as a whole decelerates, usually by hitting the ground, in which case the contusions are usually bilateral, affecting the tips of both frontal and temporal poles regardless of where the …",

      "abstract": "Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

      "title": "Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Se trata de un deficit especifico de la memoria episodica con mejor preservacion de la memoria semantica y otros componentes de la memoria, como son la memoria inmediata y la de trabajo. Se presenta en pacientes sin secuelas neurologicas aparentes, con un desarrollo psicomotor y una inteligencia general normales. La amnesia del desarrollo se ha asociado a la afectacion bilateral del hipocampo, evidente en algunos casos en la resonancia magnetica en forma de alteracion de la senal y signos de atrofia, o bien disminucion del tamano del hipocampo en estudios volumetricos cerebrales. Pacientes y metodos. Se presentan seis observaciones de amnesia del desarrollo, su cuadro clinico, exploracion neuropsicologica y hallazgos de neuroimagen. Resultados. Todos ellos muestran una alteracion de la memoria episodica con preservacion de la memoria semantica. Presentan una inteligencia general normal y siguen una escolarizacion ordinaria con necesidades educativas especiales. Conclusiones. Es necesario tener presente esta entidad en el seguimiento de los recien nacidos de riesgo por sus antecedentes perinatales e incluir la exploracion de la memoria en el estudio neuropsicologico de estos sujetos. Por otra parte, se senala la especificidad del cuadro clinico y del perfil neuropsicologico para el diagnostico de la amnesia del desarrollo aun en ausencia de lesiones del hipocampo en la resonancia magnetica convencional.",

      "abstract": "Summary Traumatic brain injury - is a condition in which the brain absorbs a certain amount of kinetic energy, which can cause functional and morphological cerebral dysfunction. Traumatic brain injury in the developed world is one of the major mortality and disability reasons, and among persons younger than 45 years, the mortality of post-acute brain injury takes the first place. Depending on the severity of brain injury, the patient may experience short-term health consequences of injury or impairment will be perceived by the rest of their lives. Experienced traumatic brain injury may result in physical disability (paralysis, speech disorders), cognitive dysfunction, and behavioural abnormalities. In the event of a disaster is crucial for timely emergency care, at a later stage is important an effective work of the rehabilitation team. The article presents the case of a patient, who suffered traumatic brain injury, changes in health status, rehabilitation treatment in various institutions.",

The most common findings in patients with spinal emergencies are pain, motor deficits, sensory deficits, abnormal reflexes, and urinary dysfunction. Acute back pain is the only symptom of catastrophic spinal emergencies such as spinal hemorrhage or infection. Sudden paralysis can result from trauma, cord infarction, or hemorrhage. Even though a thorough sensory examination in the emergency department is often difficult and unreliable, complexes of sensory and motor abnormalities are helpful. As a result of the anatomical distribution of upper and lower motor neurons, acute spinal cord lesions almost always present with hyperreflexia. The mechanism of urinary incontinence depends on the type of lesion. Spinal cord emergencies frequently go unrecognized initially or are misdiagnosed even with such obvious symptoms as the inability to walk or bladder function failure.",

      "title": "Cefalea Como Resultado de Conmoción Cerebral en Los Deportes",
      "abstract": "Para lograr cuerpos y mentes saludables se recomienda la actividad atlética. Sin embargo, a pesar de las mejores precauciones, un jugador puede recibir un golpe a la cabeza o al cuerpo que ocasiona dolores de cabeza constantes. Se estima que alrededor del 90% de estas lesiones leves resuelven completamente y el atleta se encuentra sin síntomas a la semana. Desafortunadamente, el otro 10% se quedarán con cefaleas continuas y con otros síntomas neurológicos. La conmoción cerebral es una lesión a la cabeza que resulta en un cambio en la función cerebral normal. Las conmociones cerebrales pueden también ocurrir cuando hay una caída o un golpe al cuerpo causando una sacudida tal, que el cerebro se mueve rápidamente en múltiples direcciones. Los síntomas provocados por una conmoción cerebral usualmente son leves, pero pueden resultar en confusión, cefalea, pérdida de la memoria, dificultad para pensar y concentrarse, problemas para tomar decisiones, pérdida del equilibrio y la coordinación. Otros síntomas comúnmente asociados son mareos, fatiga, irritabilidad, ansiedad, depresión, y cambios en el patrón del sueño. Se considera que una cefalea es causada por una lesión a la cabeza si comienza o empeora durante la semana tras la conmoción cerebral. El tipo de cefalea más común luego de un traumatismo a la cabeza es la migraña y la segunda más común es la cefalea tensional. La migraña luego de una conmoción cerebral se diagnostica cuando un atleta desarrolla una cefalea asociada a nausea y/o sensibilidad a la luz o al ruido. Las cefaleas tensionales no tienen estas características. Luego de una conmoción cerebral, se le aconseja al atleta evitar cualquier actividad que pueda resultar en una segunda conmoción cerebral, especialmente antes que se haya recuperado de la primera. Los atletas no deben participar en deportes si continuan teniendo síntomas. La actividad vigorosa se debe evitar si, por ejemplo, hay dificultad recordando los acontecimientos inmediatamente antes o después del traumatismo o si hay lentitud del pensamiento o la memoria. El atleta no debe volverse a ejercitar vigorosamente hasta que el pensar, la atención, la concentración, y la memoria regresen a la normalidad. Las tomografías computarizadas (TC) pueden ser útiles para descartar lesiones graves como sangrado, pero no pueden diagnosticar una conmoción cerebral. Se cree que durante una conmoción cerebral hay un cambio en el metabolismo cerebral que causa una cascada de síntomas, que incluyen inflamación y cambios químicos que resultan en las cefaleas. En la mayoria de las conmociones cerebrales no hay pruebas de laboratorio o imágenes radiológicas que demuestren las cefaleas. No hay fármaco que beneficie claramente a un atleta que tiene una cefalea postconmocional. Los fármacos para tratar las cefaleas pueden ser útiles, pero no son curativos. La mayoría de las cefaleas postraumáticas mejoran con el tiempo y al evitar una segunda conmoción cerebral. Los medicamentos preventivos utilizados para los dolores de cabeza pueden ser útiles si el dolor de cabeza persiste por más de un mes. Se deben escoger fármacos preventivos que se enfoquen en tratar los síntomas del atleta. Los medicamentos usados para estas cefaleas pueden causar fatiga, aumento de peso, y problemas de memoria por lo que pueden contribuir a la confusión. Es importante informar a los atletas que los medicamentos pueden ayudar con los síntomas, pero no curan el problema, asi se evita decepción con el tratamiento. Los atletas que han padecido de conmoción cerebral anteriormente se encuentran en mayor riesgo de sufrir una segunda conmoción cerebral. Esto es particularmente cierto en los primeros 10 días tras la primera conmoción cerebral. Otros riesgos incluyen, haber jugado el deporte durante un periodo de tiempo más largo y la predisposición genética llamada ApoE4. El mejor curso a tomar después de una conmoción cerebral es modificar el estilo de vida hasta que haya una recuperación total. El descanso y dormir bien se recomiendan inicialmente para que el cerebro se recupere. Se deben evitar actividades como los ejercicios vigorosos o cualquier deporte en el que una segunda lesión a la cabeza pueda ocurrir. Los síntomas pueden empeorar con las luces brillantes y cambiantes, como las que pueden verse en los videojuegos, y las atracciones en parques de diversiones, donde el cuello y la cabeza están en movimiento. Es mejor posponer el uso prolongado de la computadora y el hacer tareas que requieran pensar mucho y el uso de la memoria. Los factores que pueden predecir un síndrome postconmocional más duradero incluyen la confusión, la amnesia, la fatiga, y la desorientación. Otros factores asociados a un síndrome postconmocional más largo incluyen ser atleta joven, historial previo de dolor de cabeza y mareo. Las lesiones que ocurren en terrenos artifícales son más propensas a resultar en lesiones severas. Es importante evitar una conmoción cerebral. El equipo de protección ayuda en ciertos deportes, en especial cuando se practica el “rugby”. El riesgo de conmoción cerebral es más alto en jugadores de fútbol americano que tienen posiciones de apoyador (“linebacker” en inglés) y liniero ofensivo o defensivo. En el hockey sobre hielo el arrebatar el puck al jugador contrario con una carga efectuada con el cuerpo (“body checking” en inglés) aumenta el riesgo de conmoción cerebral. Un mayor índice de masa corporal y entrenar menos de 3 horas también aumenta el riesgo. La conmoción cerebral es un diagnóstico clínico, es decir, que se basa en síntomas y no en pruebas específicas. Las listas de verificación y las pruebas neuropsicológicas pueden ser útiles en determinar la severidad y monitorear el progreso, pero no se pueden utilizar para hacer un diagnóstico definitivo. Cualquier persona en la que se sospeche una conmoción cerebral necesita ser removida del juego inmediatamente y ser evaluada por un médico. Como se ha señalado anteriormente, los jugadores más jóvenes como los de la escuela secundaria tardan más en recuperarse que los atletas mayores y por eso el tiempo necesario antes de regresar a jugar es más largo. Una recuperación completa del cerebro se puede esperar en la mayoría de los casos. Para lograrla es importante darle al atleta tiempo y descanso.

      "title": "The critically ill brain after cardiac arrest",
      "abstract": "Cardiac arrest can cause hypoxic-anoxic ischemic brain injury due to signaling cascades that lead to damaged cell membranes and vital cellular organelles, resulting in cell death in the setting of low or no oxygen. Some brain areas are more prone to damage than others, so patients with hypoxic-anoxic ischemic brain injury present with several outcomes, including reduced level of consciousness or alertness, memory deficits, uncoordinated movements, and seizures. Some patients may have mild deficits, while others may have such severe injury that it can progress to brain death. High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a proven technique to improve outcome after cardiac arrest, although morbidity and mortality remain high. Induced hypothermia, which involves artificially cooling the body immediately after cardiac arrest, may reduce injury to the brain and improve morbidity and mortality. Neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest is challenging and requires a multimodal approach involving clinical neurologic examinations, brain imaging, electrical studies to assess brain activity, and biomarkers to predict outcome.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

      "abstract": "Following acute, localized lesions of the central nervous system, arising from any cause, there are immediate depressions of neuronal synaptic functions in other areas of the central nervous system remote from the lesion. These remote effects result from deafferentation, a phenomenon known as \"diaschisis\". After an interval of time, which will vary directly with the severity of the lesion, functional recovery occurs due to synaptic reactivation of neurones. This is favourably influenced by rehabilitation. Diaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of local perfusion and metabolism. [Neurol Res 1993; 15: 362-366]",

      "abstract": "Trauma is a common ocular motor pathophysiology with a predilection for younger patients. Although afferent visual dysfunction is well known following trauma, the efferent conditions are perhaps less familiar. Trauma has a predilection to produce diplopia, and this may result from muscle, cranial nerve, nuclear, internucelar or supranuclear means. Orbital trauma commonly affects the extraocular muscles with signs to include proptosis and orbital bony abnormalities. CN4 is the most common ocular motor palsy post-trauma, perhaps due to its long course around the midbrain; CN3 or 6 palsies are well know following trauma but often require more severe trauma than CN4 palsies. Supranuclear ocular motor dysfunction is common after trauma (e.g., skew deviation). Oscillopsia has been reported post-trauma, most commonly related to vestibular ocular reflex abnormalities or nystagmus.",

      "title": "Analytical study of 100 cases of traumatic optic neuropathy",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Traumatic optic neuropathy is a devastating potential\r\ncomplication of closed head injury. The hallmark of an optic\r\nneuropathy, traumatic loss of visual function, which can manifest by\r\nsubnormal visual acuity, visual field loss, or colour vision dysfunction.\r\nThe presence of an afferent pupillary defect strongly suggests a\r\nprechiasmal location for the injury and is necessary to validate the\r\ndiagnosis of traumatic optic neuropathy. Vision loss associated with\r\ntraumatic optic neuropathy can be partial or complete and temporary or\r\npermanent.\r\nApproximately 1.5% to 5% of patients with closed head injuries\r\nhave damage to visual pathways (4-6 / 100,000 general population / yr).\r\nThese injuries can be divided into anterior and posterior lesions.\r\nAnterior lesions shows ophthalmoscopic abnormalities (eg. Central\r\nretinal artery occlusion) and usually associated with a variety of easily\r\nrecognized injuries to the globe. Anterior lesions may include optic\r\nnerve avulsion, traumatic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, anterior\r\noptic nerve sheath hematoma. Posterior lesions are free of\r\nophthalmoscopic findings, but disc edema and disc pallor do occur.\r\nPosterior traumatic optic neuropathy is characterised by visual loss that\r\noccur in the presence of an afferent pupillary defect but without\r\nevidence of injury to the eye or optic nerve.\r\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES:\r\nTo analyse the clinical profile, response to mega dose steroid\r\ntherapy and visual function outcome in patients with traumatic optic\r\nneuropathy presenting to the neuroophthalmology clinic at Regional\r\nInstitute of Ophthalmology and Government Ophthalmic Hospital, Chennai.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational case study on the pattern of traumatic\r\noptic neuropathy and analysis of clinical profile, response to treatment\r\nand visual function outcome was conducted in the department of\r\nneuroophthalmology at RIO-GOH, Chennai.\r\nThe study was conducted from June 2008 to November 2010. All\r\neligible traumatic optic neuropathy patients according to inclusion\r\ncriteria, presented to the neuroophthalmology clinic at RIO-GOH during\r\nJune 2008 to may 2010 were included in the study.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHippocrates might have been the first to identify the phenomenon\r\nof acute and delayed vision loss after injuries placed to and slightly\r\nabove the brow. While there is little controversy on the macroscopic\r\nmechanism of trauma theory, multiple hypothesis have been proposed at\r\nmicroscopic level of damage to the optic nerve including contusion\r\nnecrosis, nerve fibre tears and nerve infarction secondary to closed\r\nspace edema, haemorrhage, thrombosis, vasospasm, impingement by\r\nbone spicules and shearing of dural vessels in the optic canal.\r\nIn our study it is evident that traumatic optic neuropathy is\r\ndevastating cause of permanent visual loss. Concussive force to head\r\nespecially forehead transmits shock wave to optic canal. Visual loss is\r\nusually instantaneous.\r\nSUMMARY: Traumatic optic neuropathy is a rare but significant cause of post\r\ntraumatic visual loss. The responsible blunt trauma to the frontal region\r\nmay be minor or severe and accompanied by multiple adjacent fractures.\r\nCareful documentation of visual acuity, pupillary function, and red\r\ndesaturation is essential to guide management. CT imaging should be\r\nperformed to document such structural abnormalities as optic nerve\r\navulsion, optic nerve sheath hematoma, orbital hematoma, or optic canal\r\nfracture with fragments.\r\nBased on the data from the International Optic Nerve Trauma\r\nStudy, observation without intervention is a viable option. Patients and\r\ntheir families should be made aware of the information regarding mega\r\ndose corticosteroid therapy and participate in an informed decision. In\r\nparticular, if visual acuity begins to deteriorate, then corticosteroid\r\ntherapy should be considered. If a structural abnormality is present that\r\nmay be contributing to optic nerve dysfunction (hematoma or fragment)\r\nor if the patient’s visual acuity deteriorates on corticosteroids, optic\r\ncanal decompression should be offered. Management of this disorder\r\nremains very controversial; involvement of other appropriate\r\nsubspecialists and careful discussions with the patient and family are\r\nessential to maximize visual outcome.\r\nFUTURE AND CONTROVERSIES: \r\nA better understanding of the cellular and biochemical\r\nmechanisms involving normal and traumatized axons, glia, and myelin\r\nsheaths may eventually leads to better intervention for traumatic optic\r\nneuropathy. Although corticosteroids are a type of neuroprotective\r\nagents, the recent expansion in basic scientific research regarding other\r\nneuroprotective agents may lead to a redirection in future therapy for\r\nthis condition. CONCLUSION:\r\nIn our study the clinical profile of 100 eligible patients who\r\npresented with loss of vision following trauma during June 2008 – May\r\n2010 were analyzed.\t\r\nRESULTS:\r\nBased on exclusion and inclusion criteria 100 cases were taken up for the study.",

To evaluate the role of subcortical lesions on neurodevelopmental outcomes, long-term outcomes of 50 children with severe traumatic brain injury before 4 years of age (accidental injury, n = 21, nonaccidental injury, n = 29) were reviewed retrospectively and compared with late magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings: no visible lesions, cortical lesions, or subcortical lesions. Subcortical lesions occurred in both accidental and nonaccidental traumatic brain injuries. Traumatic brain injury severity (initial Glasgow Coma Scale or coma duration) was significantly associated with subcortical lesions. Long-term motor or visual deficiencies occurred in one third of patients and cognitive deficiencies in 52.1%. Although deficiencies occurred without visible MRI lesions, global outcome scores, motor delay, visual impairment, head growth slowing, global intellectual quotients, and planning performances were significantly worse in patients with subcortical lesions. An alarming deterioration in intellectual quotient over time was noted. It was concluded that neurodevelopmental outcomes are worrisome after severe traumatic brain injury in young children, and subcortical lesions affect the prognosis.",

      "title": "508 Narcolepsy Associated With a History of Head Injury: A Retrospective Review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Head injuries are becoming much more prevalent and may be secondary to sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, domestic violence, assault, and military blast explosions. Sleepiness may occur acutely and/or chronically after a head injury. Chronic hypersomnia may be overlooked or under-reported in those with a history of head injury, and the association may not be made. Hypersomnia can occur in those with mild, moderate, and severe head injuries, with or without loss of consciousness. The pathophysiology/neuropathology of sleep-wake disturbances after Traumatic Brain Injury was discussed by Lim and Baumann 2020 in their Up To Date review entitled “Sleep-wake disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury”. They reported possible abnormalities in orexin/hypocretin, decreased histaminergic neurons, melatonin abnormalities, decreased serotonergic neurons, decreased noradrenergic neurons, and structural brain changes that can play a role. It is also possible that a head injury occurs in someone predisposed to the development of narcolepsy or that the sleepiness of undiagnosed narcolepsy leads to increased injuries. Methods A retrospective review of charts from 2013 to 2020 revealed 176 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in our psychiatric/sleep outpatient practice. Information on head injuries was obtained by questionnaires completed by the patient and/or interview with staff. Narcolepsy was diagnosed by PSG/MSLT and/or DSM-V criteria of narcolepsy. Results Of the 176 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy, 125 were female (71%) and 51 were male (29%). The age range was 11 to 75 years, with an average age of 39 years old. Cataplexy was present in 117 patients (66.8%). A history of a head injury was reported at intake by 50 patients (28.4%). Of the patients with a history of a head injury, 34 (68%) were female, 16 (32%) were male, and 36 (72 %) had a history of cataplexy. Conclusion This study revealed 28.4% of patients diagnosed with narcolepsy reported a history of a head injury of varying degrees of severity. While direct causation cannot be declared, the association of a head injury and continued hypersomnia suggests further evaluation of narcolepsy may be beneficial. Support (if any) **No support for this study was given.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Immediate effects on the central nervous system following a high-voltage injury may include loss of consciousness, confusion, seizures, and poor recall. However, seizures as a complication of electric brain injury are rarely reported. Central syndromes, including cerebellar syndromes, can be a result of both traumatic events and the mechanical effects of current flow, which may lead to an increased risk of morbidity.

With the improvement in prehospital emergency systems, larger numbers of people are resuscitated from cardiac arrests, although with the increased prospect of neurological sequelae. Neurological impairment after cardiac arrest is dependent on the degree of brain damage suffered during the arrest. Although the duration and severity of brain ischemia is often difficult to determine, clinicians are often faced with difficult issues related to predicting outcome related to awakening and long-term neurological deficits after the arrest. Neurological impairments range from mild cognitive deficits to severe motor and cognitive deficits that preclude independence in many activities of daily living. Several neurological syndromes have been described in patients who awaken from hypoxic-ischemic coma with lasting motor and cognitive deficits. This review will address many of the common syndromes after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, including persistent vegetative states, seizures, myoclonus, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and other neurological abnormalities.",

Other causes of status epilepticus include infection, which is not necessarily confined to the central nervous system, occlusive cerebral vascular disease, metabolic and hypertensive encephalopathies, primary and secondary brain tumors, head trauma, degenerative central nervous system diseases of obscure origin, and, rarely, systemic diseases including the collagen diseases.

Field loss # Appearance of retina, macula, and optic nerve In assessing a patient who has experienced an acute disturbance of vision in an uninflamed eye an accurate history is crucial, because it may be that a longstanding visual defect has only just been noticed by the patient. It is important to make this differentiation as this alters the range of diagnoses and the urgency of treatment. Acute visual disturbance of unknown cause requires urgent referral. In many cases the diagnosis may be made from the history. Symptoms of floaters or flashing lights suggest a vitreous detachment, a vitreous haemorrhage, or a retinal detachment. Horizontal field loss usually indicates a retinal vascular problem, whereas a vertical defect suggests an abnormality posterior to the optic chiasm. If there is central field loss (I can't see things in the centre) there may be a disorder at the macula. Associated symptoms such as headache may indicate giant cell arteritis or migraine. The visual acuity gives a strong clue to the diagnosis. A total lack of perception of light indicates complete occlusion of either the central retinal artery or the arteries supplying the head of the optic nerve. The nature of the field defect gives clues as outlined above. Obstruction of the red reflex on ophthalmoscopy suggests a vitreous haemorrhage, although the patient may have a pre-existing cataract. The appearances of the macula, remaining retina, and head of the optic nerve will indicate the diagnosis if there has been a haemorrhage or arterial or venous occlusion in these areas.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the result of head injury due to various causes which leads to damage of the brain, brain stem, spinal cord, cranial nerves, and arteries. Symptoms encountered in traumatic brain injury are manifold and include among others vomiting, dizziness and balance problems, lethargy, breathing problems, headache, and paralysis. Classification of TBI relies on clinical aspects, clinical/neuroradiological aspects, neuropathological aspects, and mechanistic aspects. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has been used for decades to classify TBI on clinical grounds. Severity of TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mechanistically, impact injury, acceleration-deceleration injury, penetrating injury, and blast injury are distinguished. On MR imaging, hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic edematous lesions are typically located in the anterior inferior frontal lobes and temporal poles. Coup-contrecoup injury describes brain damage located at the site of impact and on the opposite side of the brain. Focal injuries (scalp lesions, skull lesions, contusions and lacerations as well as intracranial hemorrhages) are distinguished from diffuse injuries (diffuse axonal injury (DAI), ischemia, brain swelling, and diffuse vascular injury). In DAI, eosinophilic swellings as sign of damaged axons are seen as well as abnormal axons. Axonal flow disruption is detected by immunohistochemistry for amyloid precursor protein (APP). Pathogenetic mechanisms include primary axotomy and mechanoporation. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurological deterioration resulting from repetitive brain trauma (sports: boxing, American football, soccer, ice hockey, rugby, blast injuries, other neurotrauma). Behavioral changes, mood changes, memory loss, cognitive impairment, and dementia are seen in these patients. Perivascular foci of p-tau immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, pre-tangles, and dot-like and thread-like neurites are found in the neocortex. Clusters of subpial astrocytic tangles are seen in the cerebral cortex as well as subependymal astrocytic tangles in the periventricular region of the lateral ventricles, periaqueductal gray, and lateral brain stem. Pathogenetic mechanisms include microtubule disruption, membrane leakage, glutamate excitotoxicity, lactate storm, tauopathy, immunoexcitotoxicity, and hemodynamic alterations. Treatment includes emergency treatment, surgery, and post-surgical treatment. Outcome depends on Glasgow Outcome Scale and gene polymorphisms.",

      "abstract": "Horses compete routinely in endurance-type activities. Many of the various pathophysiological mechanisms which arise during endurance exercise have implications for the health and function of the neurological system. The development of centrally-mediated fatigue is a normal homeostatic physiological event with several possible mechanisms. Development of pathophysiological phenomena such as cerebral oedema may be near-terminal events during or after endurance exhaustion. Cellular damage resulting in cytotoxic cerebral oedema may result from decreases in circulating blood volume (dehydration), blood pressure, oxygen, and glucose, or increases in brain temperature. Vasogenic cerebral oedema arises from changes in cerebral vascular perfusion, tone, and permeability. Increased vascular permeability results from increased brain temperature, poor vascular integrity due to severe dehydration, disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hemoconcentration or endotoxemia, and iatrogenic overhydration during therapy. Clinical signs of intracranial disease after endurance exercise include staggering, shaking, ataxia, paresis, poor tongue tone, facial twitching, collapse, recumbency, seizures, and death. Treatment should include active and aggressive cooling, intravenous polyionic fluids, acid-base imbalance correction, intravenous glucose and calcium supplementation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents once the patient is better hydrated, intra-nasal oxygen therapy if practicable, and achievement of a non-dependent head posture to prevent jugular venous hypertension and further increases in intracranial pressure. The prognosis for central fatigue is good with appropriate supportive care, but the prognosis for successful treatment of cerebral oedema must be considered guarded at best. Prevention is critical and must be through incorporation of mandatory rest stops with sufficient length and veterinary monitoring to allow prevention and detection of exhaustion, excessive dehydration, and neurological signs. Management flexibility in shortening or postponing rides in hot and humid conditions, mandated use of aggressive cooling techniques, and more restrictive entry criteria for upper level Fédération Equestre Internationale races should all be considered as viable options for optimising the safety of endurance horses.",

EEG abnormalities that are slower than expected for the age and behavioral state of the patient are referred to as slow-wave abnormalities. Focal slow-wave abnormalities imply a local disturbance of cortical and sometimes adjacent subcortical structures. Generalized intermittent slowing occurs most commonly in diverse encephalopathies. EEG is useful in establishing a diagnosis of brain death; it should be used only when the patient has met all clinical criteria for the absence of any brain or brainstem function due to a known and irreversible cause.",

No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event.

      "abstract": "Symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) tend to be primarily related to cognitive deficits involving the frontal and temporal brain areas as a result of biomechanical forces involving the bone and soft tissue of the head. Motions of acceleration and/ or deceleration can result in tissue strain, leading to hematomas and diffuse axonal injury. Alterations in blood flow, metabolic dysfunction, disruption of the bloodbrain barrier, calcium dysregulation, free radical formation, excitotoxicity, axonal damage, apoptosis (neuronal cell death), cerebral edema or brain swelling, and ischemia are possible factors involved in the pathophysiological cascade that can be initiated by TBI (Jain 2006; Mendez and Ardila, 2006; Sinson and McIntosh, 2006; and Stein, 2006). Focal TBI results from either contusions, or bruising involving these two brain areas, coup-contrecoup contusions, or penetrating injuries. Contusions tend to be involved as part of a larger picture of deficits from diffuse TBI although they can occur independently. Delayed neurobehavioral deterioration can occur following brain injury as a result of changes that occur from intracranial hematomas, diffuse cerebral swelling, considerable axonal injury, and further cellular changes resulting from the brain's increased sensitivity to secondary ischemic insult. Molecular events, such as the elevation of cytokines and changes in neurotrophic factors resulting in increased oxidative stress, can occur in even mild TBI.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic Injury is characterized by diminished/absent blood flow in the brain. There are numerous factors and molecular cascades that are linked with pathological hallmarks of Ischemic Injury. There is a neurotransmission imbalance after the injury. Numerous neurotransmissions regulate the essential signaling for normal physiology and the working of the brain. After the injury, there is impairment in the balance of major neurotransmitters, i.e., Glu, which shows expression which leads to neuronal excitotoxicity compromising the normal physiology. GABA is reversely related to Glu, post-injury the reduced level of GABA contributes to neuronal excitability and neuronal death. Monoamines are responsible for the happiness, mood swings and the movement of the individual, post-injury creates a deficit in the level of the monoamine which could generate the state of altered mood, movement impairment, mood swings, etc. The cognitive impairment is observed after the brain insult which could be correlated with the level of Ach. AChE activity is increased in the ischemic patients which decreases the ACh level which could be correlated with the memory impairment. These neurotransmission imbalances could be beneficial to target pathological alterations and may give new insight to find novel treatments to manage associated complications.",

A combination of sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction culminates in loss of joint proprioception and loss of sensation in the joint.2 The loss of pain perception and altered biomechanics ultimately result in joint dissolution. This disorder most commonly affects the weight-bearing joints of the lower limb and, to a lesser extent, the upper extremities and the spine. The neuropathic joint is predisposed to arthrosis, alignment deformities, fractures, and infections.1–3 The location and extent of changes depend on whether the neuropathy is central or peripheral and the degree of loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function. Various neuropathic conditions have a predilection for specific joints.

Pain generally accompanies the visual loss in cases of inflammatory optic neuritis. Compressive or infiltrative lesions that affect the optic nerve, such as optic glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma, may present with painless unilateral visual loss. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms. Optic neuropathy can also be a manifestation of inherited metabolic and degenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Positive Psychological Aspects on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Traumatic Brain Injury.",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious condition which occurs in a person who has experienced a traumatic injury in which serious physical harm was experienced [1]. PTSD is a collection of traumatic ordeals which causes fear, anger, or horror, an accident, war, natural disaster or unexpected death of a loved one. Also, families of victims will show the PTSD. Most people, who experienced a traumatic event, will have reactions of shock, fear, anger and even guilt. These feelings will increase and continue, becoming strong and keep the person of having a normal life. PTSD after traumatic brain injury is rare and must be examined in relation to co-morbidities and other risk factors [2]. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs through sudden jolt to the head. Anyone can get the brain injury at any age. The most common causes of brain injury are closed to:- Head  injury  due  to  falls, road  traffic accidents, violation and assaults - Stroke - Subarachnoid haemorrhage - Hypoglycemia - Cerebral hypoxia which is prolonged  to  cardiac arrest - Cerebral infections - Carbon monoxide poisoning \r\n\r\nThese events occur suddenly with no warning. It often occurs under traumatic conditions. When the brain injury occurred can result to cognitive and physical disabilities. To challenge with acquired brain injury, there is a need to heal the associate cognitive, mental and emotional problems of the patient. A person with brain injury has major problems such as memory, concentration, empathic feelings, and difficulty in speaking. Perhaps, the most aspect which upset him is the combination of losses that effect on personal identity [3]. \r\n\r\nThe only one way to focusing on positive aspect is identify and recognizing of existing identity strength. Also, it is possible to recognize positive aspect of current situation. It could be involved of processes that range of simple comparison such as: “I walk lameness”, but since I have seen other people who are not able to walk at all, I realized how lucky I am”. “I have made some really good friends in hospital, but now as I think, I realized that family comes first before work.” \r\n\r\nPeople who have got brain injury may need permission to represent these types of idea and help to regulate them. Psychotherapy approaches to people who have brain injury need to be more directive than other groups. It is because that these peoples have more difficulty in generating these ideas due to the problems with administrative function from frontal lobe damage. They will benefit from quick alternative questions rather than obvious approach in formal psychotherapy practice [4].\r\n\r\nFocusing on positive aspects and approach can completely change the tone of a therapeutic collision and will light the mood of both patient and therapist. It seems that positive thinking to patients who have got brain injury is better than that administering the hint of depression. Patients will tend to leave the feeling of sadness and anxiety. To work with people who have got brain injury and have poor memory, the emotional tone is very important [5]. \r\n\r\nThe people with brain injury should accept and deal with the stress in their life. After treating bruises and bumps in hospital, people should going back to work and school and have normal life. People may have some trouble with work or school, but it is normal and could be frustrating. Therefore, thinking positive on posttraumatic stress after brain injury can support healing and fights depression and anxiety and allows the person to buildup healthy coping skills. Positive thinking also will strengthen immunity and help to fight with illnesses. The best method to positive thinking is replacing negative thoughts with positive. Most people are focusing on negatives and burst problems in their mind. They will imagine the worst things that happen. Positive thinking can be used to heal the problems and avoid thinking negative. Also, persons can surrounded him/her with positive peoples who will be able to support the patient mind. Therefore it is better to change the negative thoughts to positive which it will become automatically reaction.",

      "title": "Role of Biomarkers in Early Detection of Heterotopic Ossification following Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) is a partial or total disruption of the structural or functional integrity of the spinal cord following non-traumatic or traumatic cause leads to temporary or permanent impairment of motor, sensory and/or autonomic functions. \r\nThe spinal cord functions mainly in the transmission of neural signals between the brain and the target organs in the body but also contains neural circuits that can independently control numerous reflexes and central pattern generators. The disruption of these neurohumoral functions following spinal cord injury results in various acute and chronic secondary complications. There is a wide range of short and long term complications like Heterotopic Ossifications, spasticity, deep venous thrombosis, osteoporosis etc. \r\nHeterotopic ossification (HO) is defined as ‘formation of mature, lamellar bone in non-osseous tissue, usually between the muscle and the joint capsule’. This happens as a consequence of various conditions and trauma. These include neurological injuries like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, post surgical intervention at the particular joint and direct injury to the muscle. \r\nThe exact cause of HO is not clear till date though the research has been well advanced in this field. The widely accepted concept is transformation of primitive mesenchymal cells which are present in the connective tissue into bone forming cells called osteoblasts when exposed to certain inducing agents(1). The exact sequence of events that lead to ectopic bone formation, the proper etiology and predisposing factors are still under exploration. \r\nEarly identification of this particular condition has always been a challenge. As the condition develops over a period of time with non specific complaints at the local site and occasionally mild constitutional symptoms; clinical suspicion needs to be tailored with proper investigation to achieve diagnosis at the earliest. It is well established that the medical treatment is most effective only when the patient receives it before the radiological evidence of bone formation. There are various laboratory biomarkers like alkaline phosphatase(ALP), creatine phosphokinase, osteocalcin and radiological tools including the use of ultra sound examination in early detection of HO have been reported in the literature. Three phase bone scan is widely accepted as Gold standard(2–4). \r\nCurrently pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for HO. Disodium Etidronate (Didronel), a non nitrogenous bisphosphonate was the drug of choice for both prophylaxis and treatment as it can slow down the mineralization process(5). Didronel is expected to be effective in early stage of the disease(3). Other medications like NSAIDs, Warfarin(6,7), glucocorticoids are also in use. Indomethacin is used most commonly which is shown to be effective in the prevention of HO especially when the patient receives during the first two months after the spinal cord injury even before the clinical features appear(8–10). Low field irradiation showed some response when used as the primary treatment once first clinical signs were observed(11–13). The surgical intervention is the last resort available when the HO becomes fully mature. The complication rate is high for the surgical resection which includes increased bleeding and recurrence. \r\nAIM OF THE STUDY: \r\nEarly detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients through biomarkers. \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of CPK in early detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients. \r\n2. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of osteocalcin in early detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients. \r\n3. To compare serum CPK, osteocalcin levels in early detection of heterotopic ossification following spinal cord injury. \r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nStudy design:\r\nProspective, diagnostic pilot study in a spinal cord injury patients’ cohort group. \r\nSetting for the study: \r\nThe study was done in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) of Christian Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Vellore. CMCH Vellore is a tertiary care centre located in Tamil Nadu, India. This centre has an inpatient capacity of about 2,700 beds. The number of patients attending OPD each day is approximately 5000. The PM&R department of CMCH, Vellore has approximately 130 beds and its outpatient department serves around 100 patients every day. Nearly 300 patients with spinal cord injury are rehabilitated in a year. Around 20-40% of these admissions are diagnosed to have heterotopic ossification. \r\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee of Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore. \r\nParticipants:\r\nIndividuals with paraplegia and quadriplegia secondary to traumatic spinal cord injury classified as ASIA-A, ASIA-B, ASIA-C and ASIA-D from January 2013 to June 2014were involved in the study. \r\nInclusion criteria: \r\n18-60yr old male and female patients after 3 weeks of spinal cord injury attending outpatient and inpatient sections of Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Emergency Department and Department of Spinal disorders of Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore were included in this study after informed consent. \r\nExclusion criteria: \r\n1. Patients with recent history (one week) of medical/surgical conditions which tend to raise the serum levels of ALP or CPK such as rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy, myoscitis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, hypothyroidism, severe orthopedic trauma, disorders of bile duct obstruction, celiac disease, muscle hematomas, or organ tear were excluded from the study. \r\n2. Patients with existing ossification around hip joints/ bone pathology at the time of initial screening by pelvis X- ray were not included. \r\n3. Individuals who have had hip fracture after the recruitment which is radiologically proven were excluded from the study. \r\n4. Children and pregnant women were also excluded. \r\nMethodology:\r\nALP, CPK and Osteocalcin were measured at around 3rd, 7th, 11th and 16th week of the injury. Osteocalcin samples are stored under -70°C to prevent the wastage of the reagent kit till the end of the study. Base line hip x-ray was checked for every patient at the time of recruitment. All the blood samples were tested as per the standard operating procedures mentioned in the annexure. We interpreted the biomarker values as per the reference ranges established in CMCH Vellore Laboratory. The images of the reference standard i.e. Triple phase Technetium-99m bone scan were interpreted by nuclear medicine physician. The test results were not interpreted using clinical data from participants. \r\nStatistical Analysis:\r\nThe final results were compared and analyzed with two sided Fisher Exact test using SPSS software. We found there is no significant correlation of CPK values at different weeks with the later developing heterotopic ossification in the four patients and ALP values at different weeks showed there is no specific co relation with the HO that was noticed after 16weeks. \r\nCONCLUSIONS;\r\n1. CPK may not be a good early biochemical marker for diagnosing the HO in spinal cord injury patients. The rising trend may not be observed in all patients who develop HO implying its poor quality to assess the HO maturity. \r\n2. ALP can be serially monitored to check the osteoblastic activity only in the context of absence of bone injury. Interpretation of ALP values in first four months of the injury should be done carefully. \r\n3. Osteocalcin in spinal cord injury patients is not a good tool in predicting the future developing HO.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

      "title": "Some Common Neurological Constructs",
      "abstract": "1. Subcortical (e.g., internal capsule) versus cortical lesion: Motor weakness (paresis) usually affects the face, arm, and leg equally. Primary sensory deficits (paresthesia, numbness) are more prominent because of involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Cortical lesions affect higher cortical sensory, manifesting as agnosia, agraphesthesia, and impairment of double simultaneous stimulation. Visual field defects are more common because visual tracts travel through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Occipital lobe lesions produce visual field defect, but usually are not associated with motor or sensory deficit. Speech dysarthria is more common. A dominant cortical lesion produces aphasia and apraxia. 2. Gerstmann’s syndrome. This syndrome is commonly caused by a stroke affecting the left angular and supramarginal gyrus and clinically characterized by finger agnosia, left-right disorientation, agraphia, and dyscalculia. 3. Watershed or border zone infarcts. Watershed areas are end-artery zones between superficial branches of a major cortical blood supply such as between the anterior cerebral artery-middle cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery-posterior cerebral artery. Bilateral watershed infarcts occur in severe hypotension or hypoxia, and unilateral watershed infarcts occur when the affected artery is stenotic, and collateral circulation cannot compensate in a hypotensive episode.",

      "title": "Neonatal brain injury as a consequence of insufficient cerebral oxygenation.",
      "abstract": "Neonatal brain hypoxic-ischemic injury represents a serious health care and socio-economical problem since it is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity of newborns. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is often associated with signs of perinatal asphyxia, with an incidence of about 2-4 per 1,000 live births and mortality rate up to 20%. In about one half of survivors, cerebral hypoxic-ischemic insult may result in more or less pronounced neuro-psychological sequelae of immediate or delayed nature, such as seizures, cerebral palsy or behavioural and learning disabilities, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Hypoxic-ischemic injury develops as a consequence of transient or permanent restriction of blood supply to the brain. Severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy varies depending on the intensity and duration of hypoxia-ischemia, on the type and size of the brain region affected, and on the maturity of the foetal/neonatal brain. Though a primary cause of hypoxic-ischemic injury is lack of oxygen in the neonatal brain, underlying mechanisms of subsequent events that are critical for developing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are less understood. Their understanding is however necessary for elaborating effective management for newborns that underwent cerebral hypoxic-ischemic insult and thus are at risk of a negative outcome. The present paper summarizes current knowledge on cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury of the neonate, fundamental processes involved in etiopathogenesis, with a special focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms and particular attention on certain controversial aspects of oxidative stress involvement.",

In neurobiological terms, consciousness may be viewed as having an arousal dimension and an awareness dimension phenotypically expressed as the capacity to respond to self or environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness. As there are many causes of unconsciousness, a timely and focused history and neurologic examination are critical to defining the differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

The former is usually associated with complete ischemia and the structural alterations are fairly inconspicious, while the latter is seen in incomplete ischemia or ischemia with recirculation and is characterized by shrinkage of neurons with extensive mitochondrial swelling and astrocytic edema. Both types of injury may be irreversible, but long post-ischemic period is usually necessary to see the final outcome of the insult, all the more since the neurons may not die until after a free postischemic interval (even with resumed function) of several hours to days. The delayed death is preceded by peculiar proliferation of cytoplasmic membranes before the doomed neurons become shrunken and disintegrate. This \"maturation phenomenon\" or \"delayed neuronal death\" is understandably important since it suggests that a longer postischemic interval for therapeutic interventions may exist. Several factors both during and after the ischemic insult can modify the changes and affect the severity of the damager Among the most important ones are the degree of lactic acidosis during the ischemic period, as well as the characteristics of the neurons, since excitoxic damage by transmitter substances released by the ischemic insult has been suggested to be responsible for the delayed neuronal death.",

Ataxia may be genetic or acquired, such as from illness or trauma. Acute-onset ataxia develops within hours or days. In children with acute ataxia and no recent history of trauma, MRI head without and with contrast, MRI head without contrast, or CT head without contrast is usually appropriate. MR angiography (MRA) head and/or neck, MRI spine, and CT angiography (CTA) head and/or neck may be appropriate. For acute ataxia (after traumatic head or neck injury), MRI head without contrast or CT head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRA head and/or neck and CTA head and/or neck may be appropriate. For recurrent ataxia (episodes of ataxia followed by relatively symptom-free periods), MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRI spectroscopy head or MRI head without and with contrast may be appropriate. For chronic progressive ataxia (symptoms typically appear and increase in severity over at least 2 months), MRI head without and with contrast or MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRI complete spine without or with/without contrast and CT head without contrast may be appropriate. For chronic nonprogressive ataxia (symptoms typically appear in the first year of life, last more than 2 months, and do not change in severity), MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate.

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness. An apraxia might involve difficulty in performing relatively simple movements or complex action sequences involving objects.",

Management approaches are similar to those described for demented patients. The most commonly implicated substances are alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs. Several other drugs have been reported to produce amnestic disorders, including bromides, isoniazid, and anticholinergic agents. Organic Hallucinosis is a syndrome characterized by recurrent or persistent hallucinations attributable to specific organic factors judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance.

A stroke occurs when there is a blockage or bleed in the vascular system of the brain, while a TBI results from an external force to the head. Older adults are at a higher risk of both stroke and TBI; thus, overall incidence is increasing as the proportion of older adults in the population is growing. Stroke and TBI result in immediate and long-term cognitive changes. Impairments in the domains of language, attention, memory, executive functions, perception, and social cognition have been documented following stroke and TBI. However, strokes tend to cause focal or selective cognitive disorders, while cognitive deficits following TBI are widespread and can be generalized. Individuals who have suffered a stroke or TBI may also experience psychosocial changes; for example, symptoms of depression and anxiety are common. Functional outcomes, including independence in activities, are varied and are associated with a range of factors including age, injury severity, cognitive disorders, and psychosocial factors. To achieve optimal outcomes for individuals following stroke and TBI, and to reduce the impact of the injury on everyday functioning, a multidisciplinary rehabilitation process is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Of all our organs, the brain is perhaps the best protected from trauma. The skull has evolved to enclose it and, within the skull, the brain floats in a protective bath of cerebrospinal fluid. It is becoming evident, however, that head trauma experienced in young adult life can cause a dementia that appears decades later. The level of trauma that induces such destruction is still being assessed but includes levels well below that which cracks the skull or causes unconsciousness or concussion. Clinically this damage appears as dementia, in people who played body-contact sports in their youth or have survived accidents or the blasts of combat; and appears also, we argue, in old age, without a history of head trauma. The dementias have been given different names, including dementia pugilistica (affecting boxers), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (following certain sports, particularly football), traumatic brain injury (following accidents, combat) and Alzheimer’s (following decades of life). They share common features of clinical presentation and neuropathology, and this conceptual analysis seeks to identify features common to these forms of brain injury and to identify where in the brain the damage common to them occurs; and how it occurs, despite the protection provided by the skull and cerebrospinal fluid. The analysis suggests that the brain’s weak point in the face of trauma is its capillary bed, which is torn by the shock of trauma. This identification in turn allows discussion of ways of delaying, avoiding and even treating these trauma-induced degenerations.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

The site of involvement may be (i) peripheral nerve and root, (ii) spinal cord or (iii) brain. It may accompany a variety of peripheral and central neurological disorders, including postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, traumatic nerve injury, complex regional pain syndrome, multiple sclerosis and stroke.3\n\nNeuromyelitis optica is a relapsing inflammatory astrocytopathic disorder affecting predominantly the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is associated with antiaquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) in up to 70% of patients.

The defining features of Alzheimer's dementia are progressive deficits in memory and other aspects of cognition, typically including language, praxis, visual and spatial processing, and executive function at some point during the course of the illness. Noncognitive phenomena, including apathy and unawareness, are important contributors to the burden of disease. At the same time, elemental neurological function, and therefore the general neurological exam, is usually normal, although paratonia and/or myoclonus may be present. These deficits result in reduced ability to perform daily activities, and most Alzheimer's dementia patients will become totally dependent on others unless they die of other causes first. The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's dementia is the result of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss that follow a predictable distribution in the brain. The hippocampus, limbic cortex, and polymodal association cortex sustain the greatest damage. Dysfunction in these regions results in the characteristic clinical pattern of Alzheimer's dementia and assists in its clinical differentiation from other dementing illnesses, which follow different anatomical patterns of neuronal dysfunction.",

      "title": "The Involvement of Secondary Neuronal Damage in the Development of Neuropsychiatric Disorders Following Brain Insults",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and affect the health of billions of people. Previous publications have demonstrated that neuropsychiatric disorders can cause histomorphological damage in particular regions of the brain. By using a clinical symptom-comparing approach, 55 neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms related usually to 14 types of acute and chronic brain insults were identified and categorized in the present study. Forty percent of the 55 neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms have been found to be commonly shared by the 14 brain insults. A meta-analysis supports existence of the same neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms in all brain insults. The results suggest that neuronal damage might be occurring in the same or similar regions or structures of the brain. Neuronal cell death, neural loss and axonal degeneration in some parts of the brain (the limbic system, basal ganglia system, brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex) might be the histomorphological basis that is responsible for the neuropsychiatric symptom clusters. These morphological alterations may be the result of secondary neuronal damage (a cascade of progressive neural injury and neuronal cell death that is triggered by the initial insult). Secondary neuronal damage causes neuronal cell death and neural injury in not only the initial injured site but also remote brain regions. It may be a major contributor to subsequent neuropsychiatric disorders following brain insults.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

      "title": "Aphasia from a Neurolinguistic Perspective",
      "abstract": "Aphasia is an acquired language disorder subsequent to brain damage in the left hemisphere. It is characterized by diminished abilities to produce and understand both spoken and written language compared with the speaker’s presumed ability pre-cerebral damage. The type and severity of the aphasia depends not only on the location and extent of the cerebral damage but also the effect the lesion has on connecting areas of the brain. Type and severity of aphasia is diagnosed in comparison with assumed normal adult language. Language changes associated with normal aging are not classed as aphasia. The diagnosis and assessment of aphasia in children, which is unusual, takes account of age norms. The most common cause of aphasia is a <italic>cerebral vascular</italic> <italic>accident</italic> (CVA) commonly referred to as a <italic>stroke</italic>, but brain damage following traumatic head injury such as road accidents or gunshot wounds can also cause aphasia. Aphasia following such traumatic events is non-progressive in contrast to aphasia arising from brain tumor, some types of infection, or language disturbances in progressive conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, where the language disturbance increases as the disease progresses. The diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (as opposed to non-progressive aphasia, the main focus of this article) is based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria by M. Marsel Mesulam, in 2001. Inclusion criteria are as follows: Difficulty with language that interferes with activities of daily living and aphasia is the most prominent symptom. Exclusion criteria are as follows: Other non-degenerative disease or medical disorder, psychiatric diagnosis, episodic memory, visual memory, and visuo-perceptual impairment, and, finally, initial behavioral disturbance. Aphasia involves one or more of the building blocks of language, phonemes, morphology, lexis, syntax, and semantics; and the deficits occur in various clusters or patterns across the spectrum. The degree of impairment varies across modalities, with written language often, but not always, more affected than spoken language. In some cases, understanding of language is relatively preserved, in others both production and understanding are affected. In addition to varied degrees of impairment in spoken and written language, any or more than one component of language can be affected. At the most severe end of the spectrum, a person with aphasia may be unable to communicate by either speech or writing and may be able to understand virtually nothing or only very limited social greetings. At the least severe end of the spectrum, the aphasic speaker may experience occasional word finding difficulties, often difficulties involving nouns; but unlike difficulties in recalling proper nouns in normal aging, word retrieval problems in mild aphasia includes other word classes. Descriptions of different clusters of language deficits have led to the notion of syndromes. Despite great variations in the condition, patterns of language deficits associated with different areas of brain damage have been influential in understanding language-brain relationships. Increasing sophistication in language assessment and neurological investigations are contributing to a greater, yet still incomplete understanding of language-brain relationships.",

Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment.

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome.

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned.

Neuronal migration begins in the second gestational month and is driven by a cascade of complex chemical signals. When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain. This failure of normal signaling results in structurally abnormal or completely absent brain regions, including in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus. NMDs involving the cerebral cortex are characterized by abnormal lamination and folding.",

Segun el area danada, se alteraran diferentes funciones visuales, como el campo visual, percepcion del movimiento, control de la escena visual compleja, control de los movimientos corporales guiados por la vision, la atencion visual, el comportamiento influenciado por un entorno complejo y el reconocimiento de una imagen. La etiologia de la disfuncion es variada, pero esta intimamente ligado con la prematuridad. Los principales mecanismos que pueden provocar la disfuncion visual cerebral son el sindrome hemorragico-isquemico, lesiones neurologicas focales, traumatismos, hidrocefalia, infecciones, hipoglucemias neonatales, metabolopatias, malformaciones cerebrales, cromosomopatias y epilepsia. El diagnostico de esta entidad es dificil, y en muchos casos, de exclusion. Ademas de evaluar la agudeza visual, la campimetria, la sensibilidad al contraste, la motilidad ocular, la estereopsis y la morfologia del polo anterior y posterior del ojo, contamos con unos cuestionarios especialmente disenados para identificar la disfuncion visual cerebral. En nuestro estudio hemos estudiado una poblacion de nacidos pretermino a la edad de 5 anos y, tras una exploracion oftalmologica completa, hemos realizado el cuestionario a los cuidadores de los pacientes a fin de identificar una posible disfuncion visual cerebral y, a la vez, poder aconsejar ciertas medidas rehabilitadores a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

Low-level deficits are various forms of homonymous hemifield scotomata, which affect all types of vision within their borders. Intermediate-level deficits refer to impairments of colour or motion perception, which affect either one hemifield or the entire field when lesions are bilateral. High-level deficits are divided into those of the ventral (occipitotemporal) or dorsal (occipitoparietal) stream. Occipitotemporal lesions affect various aspects of object recognition, ranging from general visual agnosia to selective agnosias, such as prosopagnosia or topographagnosia from right or bilateral lesions, and pure alexia from left-sided lesions. Occipitoparietal lesions cause the various components of Bálint syndrome, namely, simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and ocular motor apraxia. They can also cause other impairments of visuospatial or visuotemporal processing, such as astereopsis and sequence-agnosia. Because of anatomic proximity, certain deficits cluster together to form a number of cerebral visual syndromes. Treatment of these disorders remains challenging, with frequent reliance on strategic substitutions rather than restorative approaches.",

      "title": "Neurological consequences of traumatic brain injuries in sports",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in boxing and other contact sports. The long term irreversible and progressive aftermath of TBI in boxers depicted as punch drunk syndrome was described almost a century ago and is now widely referred as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The short term sequelae of acute brain injury including subdural haematoma and catastrophic brain injury may lead to death, whereas mild TBI, or concussion, causes functional disturbance and axonal injury rather than gross structural brain damage. Following concussion, symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, reduced attention, amnesia and headache tend to develop acutely but usually resolve within a week or two. Severe concussion can also lead to loss of consciousness. Despite the transient nature of the clinical symptoms, functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, neuropsychological and neurochemical assessments indicate that the disturbance of concussion takes over a month to return to baseline and neuropathological evaluation shows that concussion-induced axonopathy may persist for years. The developing brains in children and adolescents are more susceptible to concussion than adult brain. The mechanism by which acute TBI may lead to the neurodegenerative process of CTE associated with tau hyperphosphorylation and the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) remains speculative. Focal tau-positive NFTs and neurites in close proximity to focal axonal injury and foci of microhaemorrhage and the predilection of CTE-tau pathology for perivascular and subcortical regions suggest that acute TBI-related axonal injury, loss of microvascular integrity, breach of the blood brain barrier, resulting inflammatory cascade and microglia and astrocyte activation are likely to be the basis of the mechanistic link of TBI and CTE. This article provides an overview of the acute and long-term neurological consequences of TBI in sports. Clinical, neuropathological and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Traumatic Brain Injury'.",

      "abstract": "Distinct chronic posttraumatic syndromes, ascribed to neurological deficits of patients suffering severe head injuries and being in prolonged coma, are much less frequently encountered in the literature than acute traumatic syndromes. The major components of the posttraumatic midbrain syndrome, resulting from compressive necrosis or vascular infarction at the midbrain level, are ipsilateral cerebellar signs (the predominant one being intention tremor), contralateral pyramidal signs (the predominant one being a spastic-dystonic hemiparesis), dysarthria, and mild to moderate intellectual impairment. Significant bilateral cerebellar dysfunction following head injury, without pyramidal, extrapyramidal, or pseudobulbar signs, constitutes a posttraumatic cerebellar syndrome. lts most disabling component, namely posttraumatic intention tremor, may be alleviated by thalamotomy. Following severe closed head injury, an infrequently encountered posttraumatic entity of dystonic hemiplegia or hemiparesis, which may be alleviated by thalamotomy, can occur, but does not have a specific neuroanatomical basis. Intention tremors following severe head injuries, rarely associated with hydrocephalus and without other significant cerebellar findings, can develop as a dysfunction of the cerebellofugal outflow system. While chronic posttraumatic syndromes can be complex and difficult to treat, cerebellar stimulation has been utilized ipsilaterally to modulate limb spasticity, and bilateral ventrolateral cryothalamectomies staged 4–6 months apart have been successful in alleviating severe (intractable) intention tremors.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

This is to a great extent due to a decreased brain plasticity affecting the formation of memory traces for different sensory stimuli essential for different cognitive operations of the brain. Furthermore, MMN can serve as a measure of recovery or neural reorganization in different neurological disorders. For example, the recovery from aphasic symptoms after stroke was associated with the enhancement of MMN. MMN has also been useful in determining neural plastic changes of the auditory system associated with cochlear implantation.",

Post‐traumatic headaches vary in presentation and may progress to become chronic and in some cases debilitating. Little is known about the pathogenesis of post‐traumatic headaches, although shared pathophysiology with that of the brain injury is suspected. Following primary injury to brain tissues, inflammation rapidly ensues; while this inflammatory response initially provides a defensive/reparative function, it can persist beyond its beneficial effect, potentially leading to secondary injuries because of alterations in neuronal excitability, axonal integrity, central processing, and other changes. These changes may account for the neurological symptoms often observed after traumatic brain injury, including headaches. This review considers selected aspects of the inflammatory response following traumatic brain injury, with an emphasis on the role of glial cells as mediators of maladaptive post‐traumatic inflammation.",

MRI and CT-scan examination are the best of choice in imaging neural injury. Mild symptoms without objective neural deficit, mostly showed good prognosis and whenever they are deteriorate, a neurologic consultation must be done. Lesion with moderate or severe deficit neulogic is an indication for advanced neurologic consultation, neurophysiologic examination (neural conduction study and electromyography) or MRI/CT Scan examination. A complete or progressive neural deficit needs to be evaluated by a neurologist or neurosurgeon. &#x0D; Neural injury with mild symptoms can be treated with steroid, NSAID, neurotropic vitamins, and physiotherapy. Neural trauma due to compression, needs to be decompressed. Recovery process has a direct relationship with the early decompression treatment. &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;",

      "abstract": "Abstract Autonomic hyperactivity is a life-threatening manifestation of many disorders affecting the central or peripheral nervous systems. Sympathetic hyperactivity manifests with hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, hyperhidrosis, peripheral vasoconstriction, and hyperthermia or hypothermia.Massive sympathoexcitation can lead to intracranial hemorrhage, vasogenic brain edema, congestive heart failure, apical ballooning (Takotsubo) syndrome, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Less commonly, autonomic hyperactivity also involves the parasympathetic system and manifests primarily with bradyarrhythmia or even syncope. Common causes of autonomic hyperactivity are head trauma, hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome,and iatrogenic disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.Autonomic hyperactivity in the setting of cognitive, psychiatric or sleep disturbances suggests alcohol (or other depressant drug) withdrawal, fatal insomnia, or limbic encephalitis. Patients with autonomic hyperactivity should be managed in an intensive care unit as they require continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, respiration, and fluid balance.",

Crises psicogênicas, associadas a fatores psicológicos, têm uma duração mais longa e uma recuperação rápida. Enxaquecas compartilham fases semelhantes às crises epilépticas, mas com sintomas que evoluem gradualmente. A narcolepsia é caracterizada por sonolência diurna e cataplexia, sendo diferenciada pela ausência de alterações epilépticas no eletroencefalograma.

Diese können auch ohne den Nachweis einer substanziellen Hirnschädigung in der neuropsychologisch zu erwartenden Region auftreten. Als Ursache für diese Diskrepanz gelten neuroinflammatorische Prozesse und oxidativer Stress. Am häufigsten sind das verbale Gedächtnis, visuell-räumliche Fähigkeiten, das Gedächtnis für visuelle Inhalte, Aufmerksamkeit, Arbeitsgedächtnis, Exekutivfunktionen (Planung, Kontrolle, Problemlösung, Aufmerksamkeit, Entscheidungsfindung), die allgemeine kognitive Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit und die sprachliche Domäne betroffen. Es zeigt sich, dass das Vorhandensein kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen einen wesentlichen Risikofaktor darstellt, nicht mehr beruflich reintegriert werden zu können. Zusätzlich zu den kognitiven Symptomen treten nach einer aSAB auch gehäuft psychiatrische Symptome wie Angst, Depression und Fatigue auf. Diese wirken sich zusätzlich zu den körperlichen und kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen negativ auf die Teilhabe am beruflichen und sozialen Leben aus, was wiederum zu einer schlechteren Lebensqualität beiträgt.",

      "abstract": "Despite improvements in neonatology, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy remains one of the main causes of disabilities in term-born infants. This specific pathology underlies many neurological disorders such as learning difficulties, language and attention deficit, hyperactivity disorders and cerebral palsy. Moreover, it is also a notable risk factor for hearing impairments which affect neonates.Insult from hypoxia-ischemia causes immediate neuronal injury and exhaustion of cellular energy stores, as the main cause of HI brain injury is the deprivation of glucose and oxygen supply, which initiates a multi-faceted cascade of biochemical events. The combined effects of cellular energy failure, acidosis, glutamate release, intracellular calcium accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide neurotoxicity provoke, in many cases, the death of the cells, either by necrosis or apoptosis, a divergence that will depend on the severity of the insult, the maturational state of the cell or the brain region affected, among others. After a thorough understanding of the mechanism underlying neural plasticity following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, various neuroprotective therapies have been developed for alleviating brain injury.The aim of this work is to evaluate with morphofunctional, molecular and cellular methods the effect of a panel of antioxidants on HI-induced auditory deficits. To this end, we studied the effects of Nicotine, Melatonin, Resveratrol and DHA on the neonatal auditory system via measurement of auditory evoked potentials and characterization of the morphological, molecular and cellular integrity of the IC.",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

Five underwent detailed evaluation because of an hallucination, 4 for visual loss, and 3 for both. Hallucinations were either unformed (for example, bright lights, straight lines) or highly formed (for example, faces), in which case they were invariably recognized by the patient as inappropriate. In no instance did they occur in association with delirium, confusion, or use of hallucinogenic drugs. Patients with loss of vision had scotomas, homonymous field defects, and cortical blindness. These features indicate disease in the posterior cerebral artery circulation, a localization often supported by ancillary neurologic findings, for example, vocal cord paralysis, diminished gag reflex. Thus, various visual dysfunctions may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus due to cerebral vasculitis. At times they may be the most prominent and disabling feature of the disorder.",

Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals.

Brain concussion triggers a multi-layered neurometabolic cascade of physiologic changes that has important implications for cerebral vulnerability, cell death, plasticity and persistent neurocognitive deficits. Concussive brain injury has been shown to elicit a neurometabolic cascade of acute ionic changes, metabolic perturbations and axonal dysfunction. Children and adults respond to brain injury differently, with children seemingly more vulnerable to cerebral swelling and subdural hematomas after mild injury. Athletic brain injury is of particular concern in children, who tend to participate in sports putting them at risk for head trauma and in whom neurological development is ongoing. Developmental deficits after childhood brain trauma are difficult to assess due to variations in injury severity, location, and disruption of normal childhood activities resulting from hospitalization and corresponding rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is characterized by a slowly progressive peripheral sensorimotor and/or autonomic neuropathy as well as non-neuropathic changes of cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, vitreous opacities, and CNS amyloidosis. The disease usually begins in the third to fifth decade in persons from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan; onset is later in persons from other areas. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities with paresthesias and hypesthesias of the feet, followed within a few years by motor neuropathy. In some persons, particularly those with early-onset disease, autonomic neuropathy is the first manifestation of the condition; findings can include: orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, attacks of nausea and vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, sexual impotence, anhidrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Cardiac amyloidosis is mainly characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy. Individuals with leptomeningeal amyloidosis may have the following CNS findings: dementia, psychosis, visual impairment, headache, seizures, motor paresis, ataxia, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, amyloid deposits identified on biopsy that bind to anti-TTR antibodies, and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TTR by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Therapeutic approach based on the characteristics of each therapy and the affected individual's severity of amyloidosis, general condition, and social environment. Pharmacotherapeutics (e.g., TTR tetramer stabilizers, gene-silencing therapies) are first-line therapy for all individuals with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. Limited indication for orthotopic liver transplantation, which is highly invasive and does not address non-neuropathic forms of ATTR amyloidosis. Surgery indicated for carpal tunnel syndrome, vitrectomy for vitreous involvement, and surgical treatment for glaucoma. In those with sick sinus syndrome or second-degree or third-degree AV block, a cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. Surveillance: Serial nerve conduction studies to monitor polyneuropathy; serial electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels to monitor cardiomyopathy and conduction block; follow modified body mass index to monitor nutritional status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Local heating appliances, such as hot-water bottles, which can cause low-temperature burn injury in those with decreased temperature and pain perception. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing ensures early diagnosis and treatment. If the familial variant is not known, clinical evaluations ensure early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an affected individual (who is heterozygous for one TTR pathogenic variant) has a 50% chance of inheriting the TTR variant. For affected individuals homozygous for TTR pathogenic variants: Each sib is at a 50% risk of inheriting one TTR pathogenic variant and a 25% risk of inheriting two TTR pathogenic variants; All offspring will inherit a pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Requests for prenatal testing for adult-onset conditions that (like hereditary ATTR amyloidosis) do not affect intellect and have some treatment available are not common.",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

A wide range of neurological impairments can occur including peripheral neuropathies, chronic pain syndromes, brain injury and rarely severe paralytic syndromes. Outcome is difficult to accurately predict. The symptoms can present immediately or be delayed in onset. They can also be temporary, permanent or get progressively worse with time. The neurological impairment resulting from the current often comprises a substantial proportion of the morbidity associated with such injuries. It is known that electrical current can cause nerve injury, however, the primary etiology of such damage is yet to be elucidated.

      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury of the upper extremity commonly occurs in patients who participate in recreational (e.g., sports) and occupational activities. Nerve injury should be considered when a patient experiences pain, weakness, or paresthesias in the absence of a known bone, soft tissue, or vascular injury. The onset of symptoms may be acute or insidious. Nerve injury may mimic other common musculoskeletal disorders. For example, aching lateral elbow pain may be a symptom of lateral epicondylitis or radial tunnel syndrome; patients who have shoulder pain and weakness with overhead elevation may have a rotator cuff tear or a suprascapular nerve injury; and pain in the forearm that worsens with repetitive pronation activities may be from carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator syndrome. Specific history features are important, such as the type of activity that aggravates symptoms and the temporal relation of symptoms to activity (e.g., is there pain in the shoulder and neck every time the patient is hammering a nail, or just when hammering nails overhead?). Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are usually not necessary for initial evaluation of a suspected nerve injury. When pain or weakness is refractory to conservative therapy, further evaluation (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic testing) or surgical referral should be considered. Recovery of nerve function is more likely with a mild injury and a shorter duration of compression. Recovery is faster if the repetitive activities that exacerbate the injury can be decreased or ceased. Initial treatment for many nerve injuries is nonsurgical.",

Siriraj score -5 and Head NCCT show cerebral infarction in the internal capsula interna. Patient was diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Discussion: The use of a scoring system can be useful when there are no brain imaging facilities that can clearly distinguish the causative pathology of stroke. criteria for diagnosis of ischemic stroke are symptoms of global neurological deficits or one / several focal neurological deficits that occur suddenly with evidence of brain imaging images (CT scan or MRI). The most common differential diagnosis is hemorrhagic stroke. Conclusion. Early recognition and appropriate treatment is important to cure acute ischemic stroke to achieve good quality of life and prevent further infarct to brain tissue.

Recurrent dizzy spells unexplained by other central or peripheral vestibular abnormalities and with a history of migraine headaches point towards migraine-associated vertigo or dizziness. Vertebrobasilar stroke is the most frequent cause of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), defined as acute-onset vertigo or dizziness lasting > 24 hours, accompanied by nausea/vomiting, head-motion intolerance, nystagmus, and gait imbalance, whereas brief attacks of vertigo or dizziness accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs suggest transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). An immediate work-up (including bedside ocular motor tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) in order to identify the underlying cause is mandatory in order to avoid further events. Ataxic movements and gait may be related to cerebellar or afferent deficits. Onset of ataxia may be acute (Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE), alcohol or drug intoxication, cerebellar stroke), subacute (paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, multiple sclerosis (MS)) or slowly progressive (secondary to chronic alcohol consumption, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and sporadic or hereditary ataxia).",

      "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence for determining the lowest threshold for diagnosing a sport-related concussion. Data Sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mosby's Index, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and Scopus. Key words included sports concussion, concussion assessment, diagnosis, concussion symptoms, onfield assessment and sports-related traumatic brain injury. Results The majority of concussions in sport occur without loss of consciousness or frank neurological signs. Some of the hallmark signs of acute concussion include mental confusion, memory and balance disturbance. Over the course of the first 24 h, the most common symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness and balance problems, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, confusion, memory loss and ‘fatigue’. Symptoms such as tiredness, irritability, nervousness or anxiety, sleep disturbance and sensitivity to light or noise may be noticed in the days after injury. The pathophysiology of sports concussion remains poorly understood. There appears to be a period of vulnerability following concussion in which an overlapping injury might cause magnified pathophysiology. Conclusions Sport-related concussions can be difficult to diagnose. Concussion produces an evolving constellation of somatic, cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms that are typically most severe during the earliest acute postinjury period (ie, within the first 24–48 h) and diminish over a matter of several days to weeks in the majority of athletes. Athletes suspected of concussion should be removed from play and evaluated thoroughly.",

      "title": "Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral neuropathy describes the clinical syndrome of weakness, sensory loss, diminished tendon reflexes, or some combination of these findings caused by lesions of peripheral nerves. It may symmetrically involve the distal extremities, usually lower extremity greater than upper extremity (distal sensory, motor, or sensorimotor polyneuropathy), or may involve one or more named nerves (mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex). Peripheral neuropathy can also involve nerve roots (polyradiculopathy). From a pathophysiologic perspective, peripheral neuropathies are commonly divided into axonal and demyelinating types. Axonal neuropathy primarily destroys the axon, with secondary loss of the myelin sheath. Nerve conduction velocities are commonly normal with axonal neuropathy, but the sensory or motor amplitudes are low. Demyelinating neuropathy is associated with loss of the myelin sheath but preservation of the axon. Nerve conduction velocities are slowed, but the amplitudes are normal with this type of neuropathy. From a clinical standpoint, four main types of peripheral neuropathy occur among HIV-infected persons: (1) distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN), (2) acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP and CIDP), (3) mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex (MM), and (4) lumbosacral polyradiculopathy (LSPR). With HIV-infected patients, the type of neuropathy depends in part on the degree of their immunodeficiency. Patients with AIDP and CIDP more often have early stage HIV disease. Distal sensory neuropathy, the most common form of neuropathy, generally develops in patients with more advanced, or late stage HIV disease. Similarly, LSPR predominantly occurs in patients who have progressed to AIDS. Mononeuritis or limited MM can develop in early stage HIV disease; extensive neuritis is seen in late stage HIV disease and may resemble CIDP.",

Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "title": "Drug- and cell-based therapies for targeting neuroinflammation in traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "TBI pathology: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an external force to the head, resulting in trauma to the brain. Approximately 1.7 million Americans suffer from TBI every year. Out of the 1.7 million suffering from TBI, an estimated 52,000 injuries result in death, leaving a mass amount of people with symptoms that could last a few days, a few years, or their entire life (Faul et al., 2010). TBI can be classified as mild, moderate and severe. Depending on the classification and the extent of the injury, TBI can cause both physical symptoms and cognitive disorders (Lozano et al., 2015). The most common physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, sleep disruption, hearing problems and visual disturbances. Cognitive disorders include attention deficit, memory and executive functioning problems. Brain damage occurs following TBI as a result of direct neural cell loss. Within minutes following the initial injury, secondary cell death occurs, exacerbating the damage and worsening the symptoms (Campolo et al., 2013). Neuroinflammation is one of many factors that can lead to neurodegeneration and cause secondary cell death, indicating that TBI presents with equally debilitating symptoms as a chronic disease in addition to the widely accepted pathological manifestations acutely after injury (DelaPeña et al., 2014). TBI-induced secondary death mechanisms and neuroinflammation: The immune system has a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, including TBI and neurodegenerative diseases, mitigating the neural environment via cytokines with opposing roles, ones which aid cellular repair and others that drive molecular damage. While the mode of injury in TBI is predominantly ascribed to the acute stage, it is now being recognized that there is a massive chronic neuroinflammation that propagates the secondary cell death over a prolonged period of time after the initial insult (Frugier et al., 2010; Acosta et al., 2013). Chronic neuroinflammation initiates an upsurge of pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive neuronal cell death, increase reactive oxygen species and reduce neurogenesis (Acosta et al., 2014). Patients with a history of TBI require long-term care, and unfortunately a treatment does not yet exist that can ameliorate the long-standing effects of neuroinflammation. Whereas the primary insult in TBI occurs at the moment of impact as mechanical cell destruction (Frugier et al., 2010), the secondary injury commences thereafter and may persist for months and even years via chemical and molecular cell death-propagating processes that impede host brain repair and lead to progressive cell death reminiscent of neurodegeneration with co-morbid symptoms. Following the acute injury, activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 rise, followed by increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the ensuing weeks after injury (Frugier et al., 2010). One of the best studied cytokines and the one released in the greatest amounts involved in TBI is IL-6, an important inducer of the acute phase reaction. Immediately following impact in TBI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-6 have already doubled (Frugier et al., 2010). A diffuse axonal injury coincides with vigorous cytokine response following injury, independent of the macroscopic injury pattern as evidenced in a study of human patients (Frugier et al., 2010). In tandem, inflammation in chronic TBI upregulates active microglia both proximally and distally to the location of injury, a study of chronic TBI by Acosta et al. (2013) demonstrated multiple sites of increased neuroinflammation in sites adjacent to and remote to the injury origin. In addition, there is a decrease in cell proliferation in areas of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ), sites of endogenous stem cell growth (Acosta, 2013). Current drug treatments for TBI: Currently there are limited treatment options for TBI, leaving most patients relying on rehabilitation therapy. Damage resulting from the initial injury is almost impossible to treat; therefore for this practical reason, the logical target for treatment intervention to afford clinically relevant benefits is to sequester the secondary cell death. Due to the delay in damage derived from secondary cell death, it allows a wide therapeutic window (Lozano et al., 2015). Among the secondary wave of biochemical cascades, targeting neuroinflammation appeals to this extended time for treatment initiation (Lozano et al., 2015). There have been a variety of drugs that have been reported to reduce inflammation in the central nervous system, including melatonin, minocycline and statins. Melatonin, derived from the pineal gland, has been shown to provide neuroprotection for brain and spinal cord trauma. Melatonin is a lipophilic enzyme, meaning it does not need a specific binding site or a receptor on the cell brain causing the drug to be more flexible than others (Campolo et al., 2013). Melatonin exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects through its capability to inhibit microglial activation and lower proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Lozano et al., 2015). Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, also possesses anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown as an effective neuroprotective agent in many animal models of neurological disorders. This drug has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, decrease damaged tissues, and reduce inflammation (Lozano et al., 2015). Minocycline suppresses proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion, and inhibits activation of detrimental microglial cells thereby limiting the progression of secondary cell death (Lozano et al., 2015). Statins have also been demonstrated neuroprotective properties. This class of drugs is typically used to lower cholesterol, but renders inactivation of cell death-associated microglia and astrocytes. With this deactivation, statins are able to dampen the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improve the inflammatory response in the damaged tissues (Lozano et al., 2015). Stem cell therapy for TBI-mediated neuroinflammation: Neuroinflammation has been observed in TBI patients up to 17 years after the initial impact (Giunta et al., 2012). As discussed previously, this inflammatory response involves immune cells, microglia, cytokines, chemotactic cytokines, and other cells that exacerbate the evolution of cell death temporally and spatially (Lozano et al., 2015). In addition to drugs, stem cell therapy offers a novel option in reducing the aberrant inflammation. While stem cells have been originally explored as a key component of regenerative medicine for brain disorders, including TBI, via their ability to replace dead or dying cells and to stimulate endogenous repair mechanism, accumulating evidence implicates robust anti-inflammatory effects of stem cells (Lozano et al., 2015). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in particular have been widely studied in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of TBI. Co-culture of MSCs with purified immune cells causes an increase in production of the anti-inflammatory interleukins IL-4 and IL-10, while decreasing the amount of TNF-α and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (Walker et al., 2009). The upregulation of IL-4 along with the decrease in IFN-γ promotes a shift in the helper T cell subsets, from cytotoxic Th1 cells to Th2 cells (Walker et al., 2009). Additionally, a decrement in TNF-α with an elevated IL-10 could lessen the maturation of dendritic cells, while increasing the number of regulatory T cells that promote an anti-inflammatory or tolerant response (Walker et al., 2009). Studies in TBI experimental models have shown that stem cell therapy suppresses inflammation through their secretion of TNF-α-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6). This secretion interferes with the signaling pathway involved in the activation of toll-like receptors and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the latter known to be involved in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Lozano et al., 2015). Thus, the NF-κB pathway is inhibited along with further pro-inflammatory cascades that follow (Lozano, 2015). Other benefits of MSCs in dampening the inflammatory response include the inactivation of hyaluronan, modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines to producing anti-inflammatory cytokines, and limiting the influx of devastating chemokines into the brain (Lozano et al., 2015). Among many other stem cells, human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) also have the potential to treat TBI as evidenced through extensive studies in which inflammation is attenuated. HUCBCs suppress lymphocyte, granulocyte, and monocyte infiltration (Arien-Zakay et al., 2011). Suppression of astrocytic and microglial activation in the parenchyma is also accomplished by transplanted HUCBCs, coincident with an increase in the production of IL-10 and the decrease in IFN-γ (Arien-Zakay et al., 2011). A combination therapy involving stem cells and drugs for arresting inflammation in TBI should also be considered. Stem cells afford neuroprotection, however, they cannot survive in a hostile environment by themselves (Lozano et al., 2015). Adjunctive treatment with growth factors that will improve the environment and further enhance the regeneration of damaged tissue can be achieved by using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Lozano et al., 2015). G-CSF enhances endogenous stem cells and promotes stemness maintenance, affords an anti-inflammatory effect, reduces brain edema, and improves the control of glutamate levels (Lozano et al., 2015). Accordingly, a combination therapy, as opposed to stand-alone treatment, may prove as an optimal regimen to combat neuroinflammation, as well as the other multi-pronged cell death mechanisms in TBI in order to produce a robust and longer-lasting sequestration of progressive neurodegeneration. Future directions of research on neuroinflammation for TBI: Drugs and cell based-therapies are being investigated as potential treatments for TBI. The recognition of acute and chronic phases of TBI is paramount to truly capturing the pathological manifestations of the disease. Among the many secondary cell death processes associated with TBI, neuroinflammation offers a wider therapeutic window. Immune cells, astrocytes, cytokines and chemokines are all necessary for brain repair. However those are the same cells that cause secondary cell death and further damage to TBI when they reach excessive levels. Drugs, such as melatonin, minocycline and statins, may render anti-inflammatory responses in TBI. Stem cell therapy has also emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for TBI, and recently stem cells been implicated as vehicles of anti-inflammatory factors. Further investigations are necessary to find the optimal regimens for drugs, stem cells, or a combination thereof in order to sequester the TBI-mediated secondary cell death mechanisms, especially inflammation. Discovering, understanding and transitioning secondary cell death factors from being detrimental to serving as an anti-inflammatory brain repair mechanismis likely to provide a therapeutic benefit for TBI.",

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

Cerebrale Visuele Inperking (CVI) kan omschreven worden als een visuele stoornis als gevolg van al dan niet aantoonbare schade aan een of meerdere hersengebieden na het chiasma opticum of aan slechtziendheid waar geen oculaire verklaring voor bestaat. CVI kan veroorzaakt worden door het hypoxische-ischemisch letsel. Daarnaast kunnen prematuriteit, hydrocefalus, epilepsie en beschadigingen aan het centraal zenuwstel, CVI tot gevolg hebben. De klinische symptomen van CVI kunnen zich manifesteren in onder andere visueel sensorische symptomen, oculomotorische symptomen en hogere visuele symptomen. Een ander opvallend kenmerk is verminderde gezichtsscherpte zonder oogheelkundige verklaring. CVI kan samengaan met oogheelkundige afwijkingen zoals strabismus, optische atrofie en nystagmus. Daarnaast doen visuele problemen zich met name voor op het gebied van de hogere cognitieve processen als herkenning, orientatie, diepte-perceptie, gelijktijdige perceptie van beweging en visuele waarneming. Kinderen met CVI kunnen bijvoorbeeld moeite hebben met het vinden van de looproutes en de overgang van licht naar donker. Als gevolg van CVI kunnen functioneringsproblemen in het dagelijks leven ontstaan maar ook problemen in het gedrag en motorische ontwikkeling van kinderen. Deze problemen kunnen op verschillende manieren tot uiting komen omdat CVI samen kan voorkomen met andere problemen, zoals gedragsproblemen, epilepsie of problemen op het gebied van aandacht en concentratie.",

      "abstract": "Oculomotor palsies due to lesions of the brain stem may be complete, affecting all types of eye movements in one direction; this reflects a nuclear, internuclear or infractuclear lesion. This may also be disassociated, affecting only one type of eye movements, and this suggests supranuclear lesions. Concerting lateral movements, complete paralysis of abduction, adduction (sparing convergence) or ipsilateral laterality is suggestive of damage to the radicular fibres of the abducencs nucleus (VI), to its internuclear neurons or to the nucleus itself respectively. Isolated paralysis of saccades is in favour of a lesion of the paramedian pontine reticular formation. As regards vertical movements, paralysis of the oculomotor nerve (III), either isolated or associated with complete paralysis of the contralateral rectus superior oculi muscle, suggests a lesion of the radicular fibres of III or of the nucleus itself respectively. Paralysis of downward or both downward and upward saccades indicates the presence of bilateral lesions in the region of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Paralysis of upward saccades alone reflects a unilateral lesion located near the posterior commissure.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy: modeling optic nerve injury in the context of closed head trauma",
      "abstract": "Traumatic optic neuropathy: Traumatic brain injury is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality in the United States. It impacts people of all ages and demographics, particularly younger males and members of the military. Vision loss is commonly associated with traumatic brain injuries of all severities and can leave patients permanently disabled. This vision loss can be caused by injury to the visual system at multiple levels, including the eyes, optic nerves, and many different sites in the brain and brainstem (Sen, 2017). Despite the far-reaching effects of visual impairment after traumatic brain injury, its incidence after traumatic brain injury is not well measured, and few successful treatments have been identified or implemented. Traumatic optic neuropathy is a condition characterized by visual impairment after indirect or direct injury to the optic nerve (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2011). While the latter mode of injury is caused by penetrating trauma, indirect traumatic optic neuropathy is caused by force transmission into the optic nerve during head injury, or by secondary effects of brain injury such as hemorrhage or edema (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2011). The intracanalicular portion of the optic nerve is most vulnerable to injury and is a common site for compression and ischemia (Sen, 2017). Common symptoms of traumatic optic neuropathy include reduction in sharpness, field of vision, or color vision (Singman et al., 2016). It is estimated that at least 0.5–2% of patients have traumatic optic neuropathy resulting from the forces sustained during traumatic brain injury (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2011). However, it can be difficult to diagnose traumatic optic neuropathy, particularly in patients presenting with low Glasgow Coma Scores due to traumatic brain injury (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005). In such patients, direct ophthalmology is an appropriate diagnostic procedure because it can be done in an unconscious patient. However, the optic nerve frequently appears normal in traumatic optic neuropathy cases; and, because unconsciousness occurs in 40–72% of diagnosed traumatic optic neuropathy cases (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005), it is likely that there is underdiagnosis of traumatic optic neuropathy in obtunded patients. In less severely affected patients, visual acuity loss with traumatic optic neuropathy can be mild (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005), and there is evidence that visual function after optic nerve injury may recover at least partly, due to adaptive neuroplasticity (Wang et al., 2011). Still, it is possible that milder cases of traumatic optic neuropathy go undiagnosed and that the actual incidence of traumatic optic neuropathy may be higher than has been reported. In addition to difficulty with diagnosing traumatic optic neuropathy (particularly more mild injuries), treatment options are not clear. Current treatment possibilities include surgical decompression of the optic nerve, corticosteroid therapy, and combinations of the two (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005). However, large-scale studies have not supported efficacy of these methods (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005). Of traumatic optic neuropathy cases that are diagnosed, up to 48% will improve without treatment (Levin et al., 1999), and it is not clear whether there are circumstances in which treatment should be attempted. Ongoing uncertainties surrounding diagnosis and treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy, as well as the current lack of effective treatment options, suggest that further research on pathologic processes is needed. Traumatic optic neuropathy pathology is driven by primary and secondary injury mechanisms (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005). Primary injury is thought to consist mainly of the effects of direct trauma to the nerve, such as axonal shear and contusion necrosis (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2005). Secondary injury, on the other hand, is driven by processes like neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, free radicals, and gliosis. Much of what is known about these pathophysiologic processes comes from studies done using animal models (Levkovitch-Verbin, 2004). Experimental models of traumatic optic neuropathy: Several animal models have been developed for studying traumatic injury to retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve (Levkovitch-Verbin, 2004). Most commonly, this is done using partial or complete optic nerve crush, or optic nerve transection approaches. Other methods, such as blast injury and ultrasound methods have also been developed. Both optic nerve crush and transection models are models of direct traumatic optic neuropathy, by virtue of a foreign body (e.g., scalpel or forceps) directly injuring the nerve, by crushing or cutting, respectively. Transection models typically involve complete injury of the optic nerve and, therefore, interruption of all axons travelling in the nerve. Optic nerve crush, on the other hand, can be either a complete or incomplete injury, depending on the amount of force applied and the duration of application. Both of these approaches lead to death of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of their axons. Because of this, both have been used as models for retinal injury, including traumatic optic neuropathy and glaucoma (Levkovitch-Verbin, 2004). Many of the features that make these surgical models appropriate for the study of direct traumatic optic neuropathy also make these approaches less ideal for the study of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. As noted above, indirect traumatic optic neuropathy results from the focusing of traumatic force into the optic nerve, commonly at the optic canal (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2011). Typically, this kind of injury occurs in conjunction with head and/or facial trauma, and does not involve open penetration of the optic nerve. Ultrasound and blast injury approaches have been used to more closely model indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. The ultrasound model involves pulsed ultrasound, which causes an injury to the optic nerve as it traverses the optic canal, without requiring a penetrating injury or surgical procedure (Tao et al., 2017). Blast models, on the other hand, work by subjecting the animal to a pressure wave (often focused on one eye), which has been shown to cause decrements in eye function, as well as injury to the eye itself (Mohan et al., 2013). Most of the current literature on traumatic optic neuropathy utilizes direct approaches, likely due in part to the earlier establishment of those models. While these approaches do allow study of retinal ganglion cell responses to optic nerve axonal injury, they limit our understanding of indirect and more diffuse injuries often seen with indirect traumatic optic neuropathy in the context of head trauma. This is an important consideration, given that traumatic optic neuropathy, both direct and indirect, is usually associated with traumatic head injury (Sen, 2017). In any case, it appears that other models of traumatic optic neuropathy are needed in order to complement existing models, and broaden our understanding of the pathophysiology and potential treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy. We recently published a description of a murine closed head traumatic brain injury model, performed with scalp intact, in which there is selective injury to the optic nerve. In this model, experimental traumatic brain injury is induced in an anesthetized mouse, using a 400 g rod dropped 1.5 cm vertically onto the intact scalp, centered approximately over bregma (Evanson et al., 2018). Many other rodent models of traumatic brain injury are in common use, utilizing a variety of injury mechanisms. Existing models include numerous variations of closed head injury with or without an intact scalp, controlled cortical impact (which uses a calibrated blow using a motorized piston, usually through a craniotomy onto the intact dura mater), fluid percussion injury (using intracranial injection of a pressurized fluid wave to induce a diffuse brain injury), and blast injury, among others (Levin and Robertson, 2013). Optic nerve and/or optic tract injuries have been reported in some of these models, although uniformly with damage to other brain regions also present (Evanson et al., 2018). The optic nerve injury in our model is potentially caused by pinching of the nerve within the optic canal (as evidenced by decrease in the diameter of the canal under dorsal-ventral loading of the skull). We found neuroinflammation, gliosis, and axonal degeneration in the optic tract and major axonal targets of the optic nerve axons such as the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate thalamic nucleus (Evanson et al., 2018). In addition, there is evidence from optomotor function assessments that there is decreased visual acuity after this injury (unpublished results). As this model does not involve penetration of the animal's body, but rather injury of the optic tract within the intact head, it provides a way to study indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. In addition, because this method induces optic nerve injury using head trauma, it may be more relevant to traumatic optic neuropathy associated with traumatic brain injury. The multifaceted damage associated with traumatic brain injury produces multi-system injury to the brain, resulting in more wide-ranging damage than seen in isolated optic nerve trauma. Traumatic brain injury is known to lead to multi-systemic sequelae, such as effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine and immune systems (Wijayatilake et al., 2015). Particularly important in the context of axonal injury are effects on the immune system and stress responses, either of which could significantly influence the progression of optic nerve injury. Further, indirect traumatic optic neuropathy can be associated with other side-effects of head trauma like hemorrhage (Steinsapir and Goldberg, 2011), blood brain barrier disruption and edema (Wang et al., 2011), or increased intracranial pressure leading to changes in optic nerve sheath diameter (Sen, 2017), all of which could interact with primary and secondary injury mechanisms to influence the progression of an optic nerve injury (Figure 1). Thus, although focal direct and indirect models of traumatic optic neuropathy continue to provide important understanding of the pathophysiology of axon injury, it is also valuable to investigate traumatic optic neuropathy in the context of a more global head trauma.Figure 1: Factors that influence progression of optic nerve injury.Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) outcomes are driven by primary and secondary injury. In addition, systemic effects, particularly those associated with trauma in general and head trauma specifically could potentially influence the progression of secondary injury and thus the functional outcome after TON.Many questions remain to be answered with respect to traumatic optic neuropathy. These include whether – and to what extent – inflammation, altered metabolism, or other processes occurring outside the optic nerve or retina influence optic nerve injury, degeneration, and/or recovery? To what degree do other neurologic deficits after traumatic brain injury influence recovery? What are possible approaches that could be used to provide effective treatment for traumatic optic neuropathy directly, or for secondary processes that contribute to worsening optic nerve injury after head trauma? Given the complex nature of traumatic optic neuropathy, it is likely that not all of these questions can be answered using targeted optic nerve injury as is seen in most animal models of traumatic optic neuropathy. Our approach, using closed head trauma in mice, shows promise in recapitulating some of these parallel pathologic processes. In particular, our approach allows us to study the influence of head trauma-associated processes occurring outside the optic system on pathology and recovery of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. Because this is done in a mouse model, it is possible to use powerful techniques such as transgenic and knockout mouse models, genetic or epigenetic studies requiring tissues samples, or initial testing of invasive experimental interventions. Summary: Several models of optic nerve injury have been used for the study of traumatic optic neuropathy. For the most part, the published research uses optic nerve transection or crush models, which have face validity for direct traumatic optic neuropathy, but have some shortcomings with respect to the study of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. We have recently published a closed head traumatic brain injury model that appears to replicate key features of human indirect traumatic optic neuropathy in a murine model of head trauma. This model places optic nerve trauma within an experimental context that reproduces other aspects head trauma that likely influence the pathophysiology and progression of traumatic optic neuropathy. It further presents opportunities for exploring the complex pathophysiology of such injuries and, by corollary, for evaluating potential treatment approaches for these injuries.

Injury at or above the sixth thoracic spinal cord segment frequently leads to dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, which results in a syndrome called autonomic hyperreflexia or dysreflexia.

Une lésion d’un niveau médullaire supérieur ou égal au sixième segment thoracique (T6) entraîne, fréquemment, une dysrégulation du système nerveux autonome et le développement d’un syndrome appelé hyperréflexie ou dysréflexie autonome. Il s’agit d’une crise hypertensive déclenchée par des stimuli viscéraux ou somatiques sous le niveau de la lésion et causée par des réflexes sympathiques médullaires non modulés par les centres régulateurs encéphaliques. Les patients porteurs de lésions médullaires bénéficient, régulièrement, d’interventions chirurgicales pour des raisons multiples. Les complications potentiellement létales de l’hyperréflexie autonome exigent des médecins et, en particulier, des anesthésistes-réanimateurs une connaissance des mécanismes physiopathologiques sous-jacents et une prise en charge péri-interventionnelle adéquate.",

      "abstract": "Post ischemic/hypoxic encephalopathy is a progressive and widespread damage syndrome in human brain, which includes production of new ischemic foci as well as neurodegeneration associated with accumulation of amyloid protein (Aβ), which emerges within days after the primary ischemic or hypoxic ictus. Patients may suddenly suffer severe dementia and Parkinson's syndrome after a symptom-free period averaging 2 weeks following resuscitation. Death of neurons in the cortex, limbic system, globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra (SN) and damage to white matter are responsible. From experimental studies in animals evidence is obtained to reveal the mechanisms. Injured endothelia and activated platelets lead to secondary injury via thrombosis and vasoconstriction resulting in infarction and new foci of necrosis. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown allows penetration of blood-borne toxic substances into brain resulting in neuronal degeneration and enhanced inflammatory destruction. These secondary injuries happen within two weeks after moderate global ischemia. As these pathological changes cycle between the vascular and neuronal compartments, the damage expands and worsens. Aβ, β amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and the inflammation mediator cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system degeneration participate in producing secondary injury. Thus, implementing multi-targeted prophylaxis before or at the brain-at-risk stage is desirable. A combination of protecting endothelia, inhibiting platelet activity and improving cerebral circulation is a fundamental strategy to block this vicious cascade, thereby ameliorating or preventing the encephalopathy.",

Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders.

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

      "title": "Surgically Induced Neuropathic Pain",
      "abstract": "In Brief Nerve damage takes place during surgery. As a consequence, significant numbers (10%–40%) of patients experience chronic neuropathic pain termed surgically induced neuropathic pain (SNPP). The initiating surgery and nerve damage set off a cascade of events that includes both pain and an inflammatory response, resulting in \"peripheral and central sensitization,\" with the latter resulting from repeated barrages of neural activity from nociceptors. In affected patients, these initial events produce chemical, structural, and functional changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNS). The maladaptive changes in damaged nerves lead to peripheral manifestations of the neuropathic state—allodynia, sensory loss, shooting pains, etc, that can manifest long after the effects of the surgical injury have resolved. The CNS manifestations that occur are termed \"centralization of pain\" and affect sensory, emotional, and other (eg, cognitive) systems as well as contributing to some of the manifestations of the chronic pain syndrome (eg, depression). Currently there are no objective measures of nociception and pain in the perioperative period. As such, intermittent or continuous pain may take place during and after surgery. New technologies including direct measures of specific brain function of nociception and new insights into preoperative evaluation of patients including genetic predisposition, appear to provide initial opportunities for decreasing the burden of SNPP, until treatments with high efficacy and low adverse effects that either prevent or treat pain are discovered. This article evaluates the effects of traumatic induced neuropathic pain that commonly follows surgery. The complexity of the perioperative period, aside from the surgery itself, can result in chronic neuropathic pain that is not simply from a damaged peripheral nerve but changes in the central nervous system as a result of sensitization of pain.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc.

      "abstract": "Neurologic sequelae after cardiopulmonary bypass have a multi-factorial etiology. Although it is typically thought that a neurologic dysfunction means a focal lesion, symptoms of a brain disorder can be initiated by metabolic disruption such as from hyper- or hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, renal and hepatic injury, fatigue, and anesthesia. However, one of the most important causes of acute neurologic dysfunction is edema. Brain swelling is associated with the systemic inflammatory response and the passage of deformable microemboli. The larger question is whether acute symptoms associated with brain swelling because of a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier contributes to a long-term negative outcome caused by cell loss.",

      "abstract": "The pathology underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI) is so heterogeneous that outcome can vary from death, to surviving with severe cognitive disabilities, or even to complete recovery. Conventional acute management in TBI involves identifying the most distinct visible pathology such as large focal lesions (skull fracture, epidural and subdural hematomas, contusions) that often require immediate neurosurgical intervention. Mortality is very high when focal lesions are accompanied by brain swelling and especially when increased intracranial pressure gradients evolve into brain herniation. Postmortem studies have consistently demonstrated that the biological cascade converges on a final common pathway of brain ischemia.1\n\nThere is growing awareness of the much less visible TBI pathology produced by rotational-acceleration-deceleration forces, yielding diffuse white matter microstructural damage of axons. A 1956 landmark article described “findings in brains of patients who survived a closed head injury” in which “the head injuries seemed uncomplicated, that is, there were no fractures of the skull, no intracranial hematomata or lacerations of the brain, and no evidence of raised intracranial pressure at any time.” Pathologically unsuspected (from macroscopic examination) diffuse degeneration of white matter tracts occurred in all patients.2 This type of pathology, reproduced in animal models, is denoted with the term diffuse axonal injury (DAI) or traumatic axonal injury.3,4 Paradoxically, DAI, while almost …",

TBI, especially if severe, can produce structural and functional modifications of the brain, which in turn can result in a highly variable and complex interaction of symptoms depending on the motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and autonomic spheres. The brain during traumatic collision is prone to insults due to a complex combination of acceleration and deceleration and translation and rotation forces causing contusions, diffuse axonal injuries (DAI), and haemorrhages. Moreover, damages to neurons may occur as a consequence of biochemical modifications as a consequence of a drop in the levels of oxygen and glucose, and, finally, because of blood hypotension or increased intracranial pressure. This complex combination of and interaction among insults tends to produce a heterogeneous association of diffused and focalized damages that affect every possible area of the brain: cortical, subcortical, and midbrain. In addition, mild TBI can produce cerebral damage whose severity is directly correlated with the length of loss of consciousness and of post-traumatic amnesia",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "The psychiatrist is brought into contact with the patient who has received a blow on the head some time after the event in the majority of cases. His task is in many instances to be shared with the neurological surgeon. The Army psychiatrist is called upon to see such a large number of such cases that the following somewhat exoteric account is offered as covering some of the major considerations involved. A blow to the head may result simply in stunning, in which case the patient thereafter remembers, if vaguely, the essentials of his behaviour and experience, or the alteration of consciousness may be more severe and for some recognizable interval he may subsequently possess a true amnesia, in which case we speak of concussion. The degree of concussion clearly comprehends a wide range of disturbance of function which may almost immediately be fatal. Thirdly, the patient may be killed outright. Functionally considered, therefore, there are three degrees of effect from head injury : stunning, concussion, and death. Structurally we have no real parallelism of observed pathology, since it is only cases of severe concussion which characteristically come to autopsy. Consequently nothing is known for certain concerning the pathology of concussion. Cerebral contusion is therefore clearly inadmissible as a synonym, although its existence may be presumed in severe cases. As regards the after-effects of head injury it is clear that the disturbance of function may be psychogenic or physiogenic, or a mixture of the two, and in discussing the physiogenic results there are two main clinical methods of approach. In the first our interest is focused on syndrome production, and in the second we are more concerned with individual function. Clinical orientation, however, as in all psychiatry, can only be achieved by the former.",

Partial seizures are focal—they involve only circumscribed areas of the brain—and may occur in a fully conscious state (simple partial seizures or focal seizures without dyscognitive features) or may produce altered states of consciousness (complex partial seizures or focal seizures with dyscognitive features). Patients who have alterations of consciousness during a seizure (complex partial seizures) may be amnestic or partially amnestic for some of the seizure episode. Seizures may induce cardiac arrthymias. This may be a cause of death. Partial seizures often begin in childhood but may not be diagnosed until the individual is an adult.

Others have proposed the term ''shaken-impact syndrome,'' since it more accurately reflects the age range and different mechanisms of injury.

Long bone and=or rib fractures or evidence of other injuries (e.g., abdominal or urogenital) of differing ages are common findings.

      "abstract": "Head injury is a major cause of death and disability in young, active population. It may introduce energy through the skin to the deepest structures of the brain. The entered energy may cause direct or primary injury, or result in other, secondary, events to the tissues. These are mechanical loads and are classified as static when the duration of loading is more than 200 ms and dynamic when less than this. The dynamic loads are further classified as impact if the injurious agent has contact with the head or impulsive when the load exerted to other body part/s results in damage to the brain by the change in speed of the head motion. Impact loads can either exert their effect with direct contact to the tissue or may cause inertial loads. The direct contact can cause deformation of the skull or induce energy stress waves to the head and brain. All of these events will result in tissue strain due to compression, tension, or shear. The strain will culminate in injury, which may be a scalp abrasion, laceration, skull fracture, or different kinds of intracranial traumatic lesions.",

      "abstract": "Summary While all patients with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Seizures may be acute symptomatic or unprovoked. Acute symptomatic seizures are seizures occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Unprovoked seizures are seizures occurring in the absence of precipitating factors and may be caused by a static injury (remote symptomatic seizures) or a progressing injury (progressive symptomatic seizures). Unprovoked seizures may be single or recurrent (epilepsy). The incidence of acute symptomatic seizures is 29–39 per 100,000 per year. These predominate in men, in the youngest age class, and in the elderly. Traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, drug withdrawal, infarction, and metabolic insults are the commonest causes. The incidence of single unprovoked seizures is 23–61 per 100,000 person‐years. As with epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures predominate in men and in patients less than 12 months and older than 65 years. Studies on the mortality of acute symptomatic seizures are lacking. A standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.3 has been reported in patients experiencing a single unprovoked seizure. The SMR in patients with a newly diagnosed unprovoked seizure ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 according to the study population and design. The SMR is highest in the youngest patients and in those with symptomatic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can be defined as the most complex disease in the most complex organ. When an acute brain injury occurs, several pathophysiological cascades are triggered, leading to further exacerbation of the primary damage. A number of events potentially occurring after TBI can compromise the availability or utilization of energy substrates in the brain, ultimately leading to brain energy crisis. The frequent occurrence of secondary insults in the acute phase after TBI, such as intracranial hypertension, hypotension, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, seizures, can then increase cerebral damage, and adversely affect outcome. Neuromonitoring techniques provide clinicians and researchers with a mean to detect and reverse those processes that lead to this energy crisis, especially ischemic processes, and have become a critical component of modern neurocritical care. Which is the best way to monitoring the brain after an acute injury has been a matter of debate for decades. This review will discuss how monitoring the injured brain can reduce secondary brain damage and ameliorate outcome after acute brain injury.",

      "title": "ESRA19-0709 Peripheral nerve block in the patient with pre-existing neuropathy",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> <i>Peripheral neuropathy</i> is a general term that refers to any disorder resulting in deranged function and/or structure of any peripheral nerve (sensory, motor, or autonomic). <h3>Background</h3> The overall prevalence of the condition is about 2400 (2.4%) per 100 000 populations, but in people older than 55 years, the prevalence rises to about 8000 (8%) per 100 000 (1). Diabetic polyneuropathy is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy (34%). Even after thorough investigation, about a quarter of neuropathies are deemed idiopathic. the third place (13%) is shared by inflammatory and toxic (alcohol, chemotherapy induced) neuropathies, followed by hereditary (6%) and other neuropathies (2%). Presenting features may be altered sensation, pain, muscle weakness, atrophy, and/or autonomic symptoms. Electrodiagnostic studies are helpful in establishing whether the distribution is consistent with mononeuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex, plexopathy, or polyneuropathy; in differentiating between demyelinating or axonal types. Importantly, they also serve to localise the site of injury and determine the severity of the lesion. <i>Mononeuropathy</i> implies a focal lesion of a single peripheral nerve. the most common mononeuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome caused by entrapment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, followed closely by ulnar neuropathy due to compression of the nerve at or near the elbow. <i>Mononeuropathy multiplex</i> describes the involvement of multiple separate non-contiguous peripheral nerves, either simultaneously or serially, with a random, multifocal, and frequently rapidly evolving pattern. Assessment of these patients is an urgent matter as many of them have vasculitis associated with a systemic disease. <i>Polineuropathy</i> is most commonly distal symmetrical. the prototype is chronic sensory and motor polyneuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus, progressing towards 'stocking-glove' sensory loss, distal muscle wasting and weakness, and absent tendon reflexes. <i>Acute polyneuropathy</i> presenting as rapidly progressive paralysis is usually one of the variants of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can progress rapidly to respiratory failure. <i>Chronic polyneuropathies</i> are further classified on the basis of electrophysiological findings into: i) Demyelinating: with uniform symmetrical slowing of nerve conduction usually indicates a genetically determined neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary liability to pressure palsies), whereas multifocal slowing and conduction block are indicative of acquired demyelinating neuropathies (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, paraproteinaemic etc). ii) Axonal: the most common variety, with diabetes mellitus being the leading cause. Others include nutritional deficiencies, chronic renal failure, malignant diseases as well as exogenous intoxications from medications, alcohol or chemical agents. <h3>Where lies the problem?</h3> Regional anaesthesia is generally considered safe, but several risk factors may contribute to new-onset neurological deficit. Because each of the afore mentioned clinical conditions entail compromise to neural structures, the concern is that further insult from surgical or anaesthetic causes may result in new or worsening postoperative neurologic deficits. Complicating issues are: <i>Double-crush phenomenon,</i> whereby a second minor insult may result in impaired axoplasmic flux to the point of denervation; or indeed a single minor insult to the already affected axoplasmic flux (in <i>subclinical neuropathies</i>) may result in denervation. Thus, the performance of peripheral or neuraxial regional techniques in patients with pre-existing neuropathies may theoretically place them at increased risk of a double-crush phenomenon (3). <i>Postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy (PSIN)</i> is a recently described process clinically manifested in the form of severe postoperative neurologic deficits (focal, multifocal, or diffuse). It is an idiopathic, immune-mediated response to a physiologic stress such as an infectious process, a vaccination, or a surgical procedure. Furthermore, the onset may not be apparent during the immediate postoperative period, and the deficit may be anatomically remote from the surgical site/regional anaesthesia needle entry point. the treatment of choice is suppression of immune response (with prolonged high dose corticosteroids or iv immunoglobulins) in an effort to sufficiently blunt the inflammatory response to allow for axonal regeneration (3). <h3>To block or not to block?</h3> The approach to the patient with a pre-existing neuropathy presenting to the operating theatre as a potential candidate for regional anaesthesia entails performing the standard preoperative evaluation and documentation with special emphasis on the neurologic examination. It is imperative to document baseline neurologic function and sensory and motor deficits. If regional anaesthesia is considered a prudent choice for these patients, a comprehensive <i>discussion detailing the relevant risks, benefits, and alternatives should be undertaken and documented.</i> Although the scientific evidence is still inadequate to determine the likelihood of developing new neuropathic pain in these patients, the incidence in the general population may and should be used as the best-case scenario (4). Brull R et al have indicated that the incidence of perioperative neuropathy was generally 100 times higher after peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) (2.84% after interscalene, 1.48% after axillary, 0.34% after femoral block) than after neuraxial (0.04% and 0.02% after spinal and epidural, respectively) blocks, with the likelihood of complete resolution being much higher after PNB-induced neuropathy (5). While the most conservative legal approach is to avoid regional anaesthesia in patients with pre-existing neuropathy, the decision to proceed with regional anaesthesia should be made on a case-by-case basis (4). Nerve blocks may be desirable for their own benefits; or to avoid general anaesthesia and minimise the surgical stress response in vulnerable patients with comorbidities. (6). In addition, caution should be used to <i>minimise potential risk factors for perioperative nerve injury</i> at each step of patient care. <h3>Hereditary peripheral neuropathy</h3> The most common inherited neuropathy is <i>Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)</i> disease. It affects 1:2500 people, caused by mutations in more than 30 genes responsible for manufacturing neurons or the myelin sheath (3). Small case series and anecdotal case reports describe no worsening of the neurological condition after nerve blocks. of note, an analgesic supraclavicular block using 30 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% lasted 30 hours (7). <i>Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)</i> is another rare (2–5 in 100,000) inherited demyelinating peripheral neuropathy linked to a mutation on the PMP-22 gene resulting in reduced myelin production. Patients suffer from repeated motor and sensory neuropathies following brief nerve compression or mild trauma (pressure palsies) (3). the main feature of the condition is sausage-shaped peripheral nerves, called tomaculas, resulting from abnormal myelin thickness. a number of case reports describe uneventful recovery with no worsening of the neurologic condition following labour epidural analgesia (8,9). Another case report describes the development of intraoperative nerve injury and subsequent diagnosis of HNPP in a woman after breast surgery under general anaesthesia (10). Two clinical implications have emerged: i) considering HNPP for differential diagnosis in patients who develop postoperative neuropathy without obvious risk factors ii) ultrasound guidance may be ideally suited for the performance of nerve blocks as it enables visualisation and avoidance of the enlargement during needle advancement toward target nerves (3). Recommendation: Although definitive recommendations cannot be made, PNB appears safe in patients with stable CMT and HNPP disease states without worsening of their neurologic symptoms. Universal precautions to minimise modifiable risk factors for nerve injury should be taken (3). <h3>Acquired peripheral neuropathy</h3> <i>Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN)</i> is the most common systemic polyneuropathy with the prototype being a distal symmetric sensorimotor pattern. It is present in 4–5% of patients at the time of diagnosis with &gt;50% of long-standing diabetic patients being symptomatic. Nearly all patients have evidence of abnormal nerve conduction (3). the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased likelihood of surgery will translate into a larger number of diabetic patients presenting for surgery. In addition, they may present with either undiagnosed DM or known diabetes with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia. There is an abundance of animal and human data suggesting that diabetic nerves may have an increased risk of neurologic injury after regional anaesthesia compared with non-diabetic nerves. What do we know so far? Diabetic nerves have decreased sensitivity to electrical stimulation (11). This may increase the risk of intraneural injection if reliant solely on this technique. US has the added ability to use the cross–sectional area of a peripheral nerve to both identify a neuropathy and intraneural injection. Block success rates are higher in diabetic patients (12). Block duration is longer thus obviating the need for adding vasoconstrictors (ie adrenaline) (13). Minimum effective anaesthetic concentration (ED50) in vivo to achieve a motor sciatic block in diabetic rats is about two thirds of that required in non–diabetic rats (14). Neurotoxicity of LA is experimentally proven, clinically inconclusive (15). Although the concern for an increased susceptibility to injury appears real, these patients should not be deprived of the benefits of regional anaesthesia. the anaesthetic technique should be instead modified in order to minimise the potential additive risk (US guidance, decreased concentration, reduced total dose, no vasoconstrictors) (3). the diabetic nerve appears swollen on ultrasound due to the increased water content, a by-product from the conversion of glucose to sorbitol. Interestingly, in about 20% of nerves with moderate to advanced diabetic neuropathy intraneural blood flow is detected (16). <i>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN)</i> occurs in up to 50% of patients on chemotherapy. Patients who recover from CIPN have an increased risk of developing progressive neuropathic symptoms if exposed to additional neurotoxic agents. In addition, it is common for patients to have a subclinical neuropathy that presents only following a second neurologic insult, such as a PNB (3). a retrospective study of 216 PNBs performed in 186 patients previously treated with chemotherapy revealed a 2.2% incidence of peripheral nerve injury (not dissimilar to the baseline incidence in the general population) (17). Although PNB may be safely performed in the presence of CIPN, the possibility of sustaining additional neurologic injury should be considered and caution exercised (3). <h3>Inflammatory neuropathies</h3> <i>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)</i> is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating polyneuropathy. Infection, pregnancy, vaccinations, immunosuppression, systemic illnesses, transfusion have all been incriminated. There are several reports of GBS occurring in the postoperative period after a variety of surgical procedures and types of anaesthetics. Although there are no case reports of PNB in patients with GBS, the general wisdom is that acute neuronal inflammation may be a relative contraindication to regional anaesthesia. the current literature can neither support nor refute this claim. Ultimately, the decision should be made on an individual basis and avoidance of muscle relaxants, opioids, intubation may prevail (3). <i>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</i> is an inflammatory degenerative disease of poorly defined aetiology, characterised by demyelination lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Neurologic symptoms may worsen postoperatively due to any stressor regardless of the anaesthetic technique. Historically, PNBs have been considered safe until evidence documenting peripheral demyelinating lesions (5–47% of MS patients) emerged (18). PNB has not been definitely shown to be harmful in the setting of MS and thus should not be considered an absolute contraindication. Given that demyelinated fibres may be more prone to LA toxicity, reducing the LA concentration and total dose to the lowest effective level may be prudent in addition to the general precautions. Patients should also be informed about the risk of new or worsening neurologic symptoms during the postoperative period because of exposure to multiple exacerbating factors (3). In conclusion, no absolute method exists for predicting whether a pre-existing neuropathy will remain static or become exacerbated following PNB. Each case must be evaluated individually, a full appraisal of risks and benefits, and the alternatives to regional anaesthesia must be discussed and documented. Best efforts should be made to reduce the modifiable risk factors to improve the chance for uneventful perioperative events. Ultrasound guidance for both nerve location and dose reduction purposes should be considered. <h3>Further reading</h3> 1. Martyn CN, et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1977;62:310–18. 2.

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury is a serious damage to the spinal cord that can lead to life-long disability. Based on its etiology, spinal cord injury can be classified as traumatic or non-traumatic spinal cord injury. Furthermore, the pathology of spinal cord injury can be divided into two phases, a primary injury phase, and a secondary injury phase. The primary spinal cord injury phase involves the initial mechanical injury in which the physical force of impact is directly imparted to the spinal cord, disrupting blood vessels, axons, and neural cell membranes. After the primary injury, a cascade of secondary events begins, expanding the zone of neural tissue damage, and exacerbating neurological deficits. Secondary injury is a progressive condition characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, excitatory amino acids such as glutamate, loss of ionic homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. This secondary phase lasts for several weeks or months and can be further subdivided into acute, subacute, and chronic. One of the most frequent and devastating complications developed among the spinal cord injury population is cognitive impairment. The risk of cognitive decline after spinal cord injury has been reported to be 13 times higher than in healthy individuals. The exact etiology of this neurological complication remains unclear, however, many factors have been proposed as potential contributors to the development of this disorder, such as concomitant traumatic brain injury, hypoxia, anoxia, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, body temperature dysregulation, alcohol abuse, and certain drugs. This review focuses on a deep understanding of the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury and its relationship to cognitive impairment. We highlight the main mechanisms that lead to the development of this neurological complication in patients with spinal cord injury.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity. It was found that no concise overview exists on this topic that reflects clinical as well as recent research findings. Therefore, this supplement was planned.

      "title": "The Nature of Hand Motor Impairment The Nature of Hand Motor Impairment After Stroke and Its Treatment After Stroke and Its Treatment",
      "abstract": "• Weakness or paresis, particularly for voluntary movements, is the most prominent sign of a stroke resulting from damage to the descending According to the American Heart Association, approx-imately 500,000 new strokes occur each year, with approximately three million existing stroke survivors. Hand motor impairment is especially common and contributes enormously to the ensuing disability. How-ever, the relationship between hand motor impairment and hand function remains unclear because much of the improvement in function occurs due to compensation rather than true recovery of impairment. Hand motor impairment in the production of finger movements and fingertip forces after stroke may be viewed as 1) a deficit in motor execution, resulting from weak-ness, spasticity, and abnormal coactivation of muscle groups during isolated movements (muscle synergies), and/or 2) a deficit in higher-order processes, such as motor planning and motor learning, which lead to poorly formed sensorimotor associations or internal representations that lead to impaired motor control. The treatments depend on the view taken. These include strengthening of weak muscle groups and reduction in spasticity in spastic muscles, to restore the balance between agonist and antagonist muscle groups for the former view and intense task-specific practice with the affected hand, with or without constraint of the unaffected hand, bimanual practice, action observa-tion, and motor imagery for the latter. However, there is no clear consensus on the nature of hand motor impairment or how best to treat it to promote true recovery. The present review attempts to clarify the nature of hand motor impairment after stroke and discusses the available evidence for treatment strate-gies to address these.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

We address epidemiology, pathophysiology, anesthetic utilization, and provide some broad-based care recommendations. Recent findings Acute concussion is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics. These aberrations can persist despite resolution of signs and symptoms. Multiple repeated concussions can cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disorder associated with pathologic findings similar to some organic dementias. Anesthetic utilization is common following concussion, especially soon after injury, a time when the brain may be most vulnerable to secondary injury. Summary Brain physiology may be abnormal following concussion and these abnormalities may persist despite resolutions of clinical manifestations. Those with recent concussion or chronic repeated concussion may be susceptible to secondary injury in the perioperative period. Clinicians should suspect concussion in any patient with recent trauma and strive to maintain cerebral homeostasis in the perianesthetic period.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from neuronopathy, on both motor and sensory sides. A number of disorders that present with characteristic electro-clinical features are readily recognized. Except for those, distinction of the lesions that concern the peripheral nerve cell or the axon may require support of clinical, electrophysiological and other ancillary tests. Distinction between motor neuropathy and neuronopathy can be based on the abnormalities of nerve conduction and on the signs that relate to the reinnervation process. Signs of terminal axonal reinnervation, such as motor axon reflex, may be observed in axonal neuronopathies, whereas only collateral reinnervation occurs in motor neuronopathies. Sensory axonopathies are usually characterized by clinical and electrophysiological findings that are axon length-dependent, by the course of the disorder that is most often chronic, and by possible reversibility. Sensory neuronopathies are usually subacute and induce clinical deficits that are more or less widespread to the whole body surface rather than distal. Follow-up studies disclose limited or absent recovery. A better knowledge of the structural differences of motor and sensory neurons and axons will improve our understanding and lead to the development of specific tests. Meanwhile, although some parameters and techniques should still be improved, electrophysiological and additional tests are useful to detect and to distinguish the peripheral nerve disorders that affect the nerve cell bodies and their axons.",

It is defined as a predisposition to recurrent unprovoked epileptic seizures, which are the clinical manifestations of transient abnormalities of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. Epileptic seizures represent a transient malfunction that can occur in any mammalian brain and may be provoked by a wide variety of factors from mechanical trauma to hypoglycemia. As might be anticipated in such a complex organ, their manifestations are highly variable, from the well-known, generalized tonic–clonic seizure or ‘‘grand-mal’’ convulsion in which consciousness is lost and the limbs shake, to brief sensory or cognitive disturbances only apparent to the patient. Epileptic seizures fall into two main categories: generalized, which begin simultaneously in both cerebral hemispheres, and partial (or focal), which originate in one or more localized foci in the brain.",

The most significant abnormality is that which is termed posthypoxic and/or postresuscitation encephalopathies whose nature has not been elucidated particularly at the cellular and molecular levels. It is emphasized that this involves brain abnormalities, which is a sequela of hypoxia or ischemia of systemic origin, rather than primary brain damages. In some patients who have sustained a severe hypoxic episode of any nature and recovered their psychoneurological status ever rapidly and rather fully, there may be an abrupt progressive deterioration of their neurological status in some days or months, which results in death or grave irreversible disability. It is concluded that not only do reparative and compensatory processes occur, but also there are phenomena of progressive degenerative changes in a primarily successfully resuscitated person or experimental animal in the central nervous system in the postresuscitation period. A classification of psychoneurological disorders in patients in the early postresuscitation period has been made and ways of their prevention or alleviation have been indicated.",

Auch bei Patienten mit psychischen Traumata oder anhaltendem massiven Stress können Gedächtniseinbußen auftreten, ohne dass sich hierfür ein strukturelles Korrelat finden lässt. So können auch funktionelle Änderungen des Gehirns, beispielsweise ein reduzierter Glukosemetabolismus, mit Gedächtnisstörungen einhergehen.

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

Depending on several factors, including level of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and neuroimaging findings, brain injuries are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Individuals with moderate to severe injuries have worse cognitive, emotional, and functional outcomes and exhibit a more prolonged recovery than those with mild injuries. Although mild injuries are usually associated with short-term cognitive and emotional difficulties that resolve within weeks, sometimes symptoms persist longer than three months. These prolonged or post-concussion syndrome symptoms are not related to the injury itself but rather are influenced by prior and current psychological symptoms. As individuals with varying levels of brain injury progress through acute, subacute, and chronic stages of their recovery, neuropsychological evaluations are used to assess cognitive and emotional functioning, predict outcomes, and provide treatment recommendations.",

The pathological manifestations of cerebral damage are usually believed to be of two general types—first, those symptoms which result directly from the loss of or damage to cerebral tissue, and, second, symptoms not directly associated with tissue loss, but, rather, symptoms of indirect or \"superimposed\" psychological disturbances, e.g., the patient's reactions to or attitudes toward disability occasioned by brain damage. Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others. In medicine, the classical picture of the brain-injured child has traditionally included some motor defect as a primary condition. Beginning",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

      "title": "Seizure disorders",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common of disabling neurological conditions, and seizures are among the most common of neurological symptoms. Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

Two types of mechanism for brain damages are described in OHIs: primary and secondary. The diagnosis of post-traumatic epilepsy requires at least two seizures after head injury. Post-traumatic seizures are usually partial at onset even if secondary generalization may be rapid enough to simulate generalized seizures from onset. About 25% of seizures are focal, 50% focal with secondary generalization, while 25% are generalized. The number of damaged brain lobes may be a predictive factor to evaluate the volume of brain loss. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should be administered to all patients with OHI, in both early and late post-injury phases, especially if a significant loss of brain tissue has occurred.",

      "title": "Mania secondary to focal brain lesions: implications for understanding the functional neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Objectives Approximately 3.5 million Americans will experience a manic episode during their lifetimes. The most common causes are psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar I disorder and schizoaffective disorder, but mania can also occur secondary to neurological illnesses, brain injury, or neurosurgical procedures. Methods For this narrative review, we searched Medline for articles on the association of mania with stroke, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, and neurosurgical interventions. We discuss the epidemiology, features, and treatment of these cases. We also review the anatomy of the lesions, in light of what is known about the neurobiology of bipolar disorder. Results The prevalence of mania in patients with brain lesions varies widely by condition, from &lt;2% in stroke to 31% in basal ganglia calcification. Mania occurs most commonly with lesions affecting frontal, temporal, and subcortical limbic brain areas. Right‐sided lesions causing hypo‐functionality or disconnection (e.g., stroke; neoplasms) and left‐sided excitatory lesions (e.g., epileptogenic foci) are frequently observed. Conclusions Secondary mania should be suspected in patients with neurological deficits, histories atypical for classic bipolar disorder, and first manic episodes after the age of 40 years. Treatment with antimanic medications, along with specific treatment for the underlying neurologic condition, is typically required. Typical lesion locations fit with current models of bipolar disorder, which implicate hyperactivity of left‐hemisphere reward‐processing brain areas and hypoactivity of bilateral prefrontal emotion‐modulating regions. Lesion studies complement these models by suggesting that right‐hemisphere limbic‐brain hypoactivity, or a left/right imbalance, may be relevant to the pathophysiology of mania.",

      "title": "Apathy after stroke: Diagnosis, mechanisms, consequences, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Apathy is a reduction in goal-directed activity in the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social domains of a patient’s life and occurs in one out of three patients after stroke. Despite this, apathy is clinically under-recognized and poorly understood. This overview provides a contemporary introduction to apathy in stroke for researchers and practitioners, covering topics including diagnosis, neurobiological mechanisms, associated consequences, and potential treatments for apathy. Apathy is often misdiagnosed as other post-stroke conditions such as depression. Accurate differential diagnosis of apathy, which manifests as reductions in initiative, and depression, which manifests as negative emotionality, is important as it informs prognosis. Research on the neurobiology of apathy suggests that there are few consistent associations between stroke lesion location and the development of apathy. These may be resolved by adopting a network neuroscience approach, which models apathy as a pathology arising from structural or functional damage to brain networks underlying motivated behavior. Importantly, networks can be affected by physiological changes related to stroke, including the acute infarct but also diaschisis and neurodegeneration. Aside from neurobiological changes, apathy is also associated with other negative outcome measures such as functional disability, cognitive impairment, and emotional distress, suggesting that apathy is indicative of a worse prognosis following stroke. Unfortunately, high-quality trials aimed at treating apathy are scarce. Antidepressants may have limited effects on apathy. Acetylcholine and dopamine pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, and transcranial magnetic stimulation may be more promising avenues for treatment.",

The disease is characterized by excessive electrical discharges in hyperexcitable neuronal clusters that result in spontaneous and recurrent seizures. The seizures may be subclinical and thus only apparent on an electroencephalogram (EEG), but more often they fit into two clinical classifications: partial and generalized. Partial seizures have a focused origin in the brain, and, therefore, seizure symptoms may present in a localized manner. Generalized seizures lack a focal origin and instead involve the entire brain. Epileptic seizures can range from altered states of consciousness to those involving motor function with clonic and/or tonic components.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurodegenerative disorders predominantly affect the neurons in the human brain. Neurons are highly specialized cells and are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. Unlike other cells, nerve cells normally do not divide and multiply; thus the body does not replace dead or damaged neurons. Neurodegenerative disorders result in progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells and can be defined as hereditary and sporadic conditions characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Most of these disorders are associated with degeneration of the affected central or peripheral structures of the nervous system. Neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), prion diseases, brain cancer, epilepsy, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, genetic brain disorders, and others. Most of them are incurable and burdensome conditions that cause complications with movement (ataxias), or mental functioning (dementias).",

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILD WHO HAS HAD ONE CONVULSION",
      "abstract": "FOR MOST PARENTS their child's first convulsion is a dramatic, frightening event which demands immediate medical attention. The physician, on the other hand, may see the patient after recovery from the attack and may tend to minimize the severity of the situation and assume a wait-and-see attitude before investigation and treatment are initiated. The convulsion is a symptom that indicates a disturbance of cerebral neurones. This disturbance may be the result of underlying organic disease of the brain, either fixed or progressive, or it may be an indication of a functional disturbance related to a circulatory or metabolic disorder. The first attack may be so mild that the child is unaffected but subsequent attacks may be prolonged, or result in status epilepicus, and produce a mild or severe degree of mental impairment. There is considerable evidence to indicate that anoxia associated with convulsions can cause brain damage and for this reason every child who has had a convulsion should be investigated and, with rare exception, placed on prophylactic daily anticonvulsant medication when no specific treatable condition is discovered. EVALUATION The first step in the study of a child who has a convulsion is to document its occurrence. Anxious parents are, as a rule, poor witnesses. Despite this, every effort should be made to obtain a description of the seizure, particularly premonitory symptoms, loss of consciousness, convulsive movements, duration of the attack, and the state of the patient following the attack. In infants breath-holding spells may simulate convulsive seizures. In breath-holding spells there is always a precipitating factor, usually a slight injury or some emotional disturbance which results in violent crying, ending suddenly in respiratory apnea. The cyanosis in such attacks appears before the loss of consciousness and convulsive movements.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "abstract": "Neuronal cell death occurs during development of the central nervous system as well as in pathological situations such as acute injury and progressive degenerative diseases. For instance, granule cells in the developing cerebellum and neuronal precursor cells in the cortex undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. There is currently strong debate conceming the mechanism of death in many degenerative events such as ischemia, blunt head trauma, excitotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases, i.e. Alzheimer's disease. Neurons can die a necrotic death when the initial insult is too great; apoptosis requires \"planning.\" For example, the cell death seen in the core of an ischemic infarct is necrotic, while in the surrounding penumbra region the death is probably apoptotic. Regardless of the degenerative pathway, damaged or dead neurons are a hallmark of many diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, glaucoma, ischemia and multiple sclerosis. Molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, reactive nitrogen/oxygen species, and proteases play an important role in promoting and/or mediating neurodegeneration. Proteases have been implicated in both physiological and pathological events, suggesting their intervention in key points when things go awry. In this review we will summarize recent findings linking extracellular proteases with neuronal cell death in both human diseases and their animal models.",

      "title": "Therapeutic recommendations for management of severe hyponatremia: current concepts on pathogenesis and prevention of neurologic complications.",
      "abstract": "Patients with hyponatremia are exposed to major neurological complications. On the one hand hyponatremia itself produces brain edema, increased intracranial pressure which potentially leads to subsequent neuropathological sequelae or death. On the other hand excessive correction could be followed by development of brain demyelinating lesions (central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis) with major disability or fatal outcome. Understanding of brain adaptative mechanisms to changes in osmolality largely contributes to explain these neurological events. When serum sodium decreases, the brain prevents swelling by extruding electrolytes and organic osmolytes, a process almost fully achieved after 48 h. Conversely, during subsequent increase in serum sodium, reestablishment of intracerebral osmolytes occurs but their reuptake is more delayed (+/- 5 days). In both circumstances, these mechanisms can be overwhelmed, leading to brain damage. Acute hyponatremia (< 48 h) is generally hospital-acquired, mainly in the postoperative state and/or after excessive fluid administration. After abrupt fall in serum sodium, seizure, respiratory arrest and coma may develop and these manifestations are sometimes explosive in nature. Recognition of even minor symptoms is crucial and implies prompt correction. There is generally no risk of brain myelinolysis in acute hyponatremia. Some factors are suspected to aggravate the prognosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy, including female gender (menstruant women), hypoxia and young age. Chronic hyponatremia (> 48 h) usually develops outside the hospital and is generally better tolerated. The risks of brain myelinolysis can be largely reduced by limiting the correction level to < or = 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, if necessary, the initial rate of correction can be rapid provided that the final correction remains < 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, when other recognized risk factors for myelinolysis (hypokalemia, liver disease, poor nutritional state, burns) are present, correction should not exceed 10 mEq/1/24 h. Demyelinization is also observed in hypernatremia but it follows greater (50%) increase in serum sodium than from hyponatremic baseline. For symptomatic hyponatremia, rapid correction is usually obtained by hypertonic saline (3%) infusion. Another option consists in administration of intravenous or oral urea. Urea allows a rapid reduction of brain edema and intracranial pressure which is followed by subsequent correction of hyponatremia. Experimental data also suggest that treatment of hyponatremia with urea is associated with a lower incidence of myelinolysis. In hyponatremic patients without symptoms, there is no need for rapid correction and the treatment should be more conservative. Close monitoring of the serum sodium is indicated initially and if necessary, correction must be stopped and diuresis interrupted with dDAVP. Given recent experimental data, in patients overly corrected (delta SNa > 15 mEq/1/24 h), the risk of myelinolysis could be greatly reduced by rapidly decreasing the serum sodium through hypotonic fluids administration and dDAVP.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

Las complicaciones de la ECP ocurren en todas las etapas del procedimiento: antes, durante y despues de la cirugia (en el postoperatorio inmediato y remoto). En la precirugia el aspecto mas importante es la seleccion del candidato apropiado, no solo referido a beneficio sintomatico, sino tambien en cuanto a conocer su estado cognitivo y comorbilidades. Durante la cirugia la complicacion mas grave y temida es la hemorragia cerebral. En el postoperatorio las complicaciones pueden relacionarse con la intervencion (por ejemplo, sindrome confusional en el postoperatorio inmediato), con la estimulacion (contracciones musculares tonicas, desviacion ocular, midriasis, hipersudoracion hemicorporal, empeoramiento de la acinesia, alteraciones de determinadas areas cognitivas o conductuales), con el sistema implantado (rotura de electrodos, desconexion, desplazamientos, infecciones), con cambios en la medicacion (por ejemplo, depresion) o con cambios en la funcionalidad y otras de origen desconocido (como aumento de peso).

      "title": "Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) for Spasticity in Patients With Acquired Brain Injury [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-dependent mechanisms of inflammation-mediated distant hippocampal damage are discussed with a focus on the consequences of traumatic brain injury. The effects of glucocorticoids on specific neuronal populations in the hippocampus depend on their concentration, duration of exposure and cell type. Previous stress and elevated level of glucocorticoids prior to pro-inflammatory impact, as well as long-term though moderate elevation of glucocorticoids, may inflate pro-inflammatory effects. Glucocorticoid-mediated long-lasting neuronal circuit changes in the hippocampus after brain trauma are involved in late post-traumatic pathology development, such as epilepsy, depression and cognitive impairment. Complex and diverse actions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on neuroinflammation may be essential for late post-traumatic pathology. These mechanisms are applicable to remote hippocampal damage occurring after other types of focal brain damage (stroke, epilepsy) or central nervous system diseases without obvious focal injury. Thus, the liaisons of excessive glucocorticoids/dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with neuroinflammation, dangerous to the hippocampus, may be crucial to distant hippocampal damage in many brain diseases. Taking into account that the hippocampus controls both the cognitive functions and the emotional state, further research on potential links between glucocorticoid signaling and inflammatory processes in the brain and respective mechanisms is vital.",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life.

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal neuronal migrations in the developing human brain are generally thought of in the context of early gestational events induced by genetic factors, teratogens, or infections. Although the major neuronal migrations that form the cortical plate occur by the 16th week of gestation, late migrations from the germinal matrix into the cerebral cortex continue until five months postnatally. The external granular layer of the cerebellar cortex continues to migrate until 1 year of age. Ample opportunity thus exists for disturbances of these migratory processes in the postnatal period. Focal zones of imperfect cortical lamination, small hamartomas, and microscopic subcortical heterotopia are often encountered during postmortem examination of infant brains. These focal structural anomalies are usually dismissed as incidental findings. In survivors, however, such minor lesions perhaps contribute to the later seizure disorders, developmental delays, learning disabilities, perceptual disorders, and motor incoordination that are so common following premature birth or neonatal",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

      "abstract": "A prerequisite to the diagnosis of vegetative state is the exclusion of apparently similar syndromes, in which the patient retains the consciousness partially or even completely. Some syndromes are not separate nosological entities and should be abandoned: the apallic state, the neocortical death, the decerebrate and decorticate state, the alpha-coma, the vigil or prolonged or irreversible coma are among them. Three conditions deserve special consideration. The term locked-in syndrome describes a patient completely paralysed and mute, but fully conscious, and is usually caused by ischemic lesions of the pons. Several variants do exist, either in the causes and site of lesion. Some patients may become paralysed and mute, but conscious because of polyneuropathies, that is in the absence of any lesions of the central nervous system. The akinetic mutism is a rare condition characterised by loss of speech and nearly absent bodily movements. Painful stimulation may cause appropriate withdrawing, and wakefulness and self-awareness may be preserved, but cognitive impairment is usually present. It must be emphasised that this condition can be due to potentially treatable lesions, such as hydrocephalus and craniopharyngioma. The term \"minimally responsive\" or \"minimally conscious\" describes severely disabled patients in whom meaningful responses can be demonstrated, although inconstantly. This condition, the true diagnostic challenge, often represents a transition phase of vegetative patients recovering consciousness. Physicians, physiotherapists and patient's relatives should work all together to reach a correct diagnosis, by using current available methods to monitorize the recovery of consciousness.",

Kod osoba koje su preboljele moždani udar, hemipareza ce se obicno javiti na suprotnoj strani tijela od zahvacene strane mozga. Osim slabosti jedne strane tijela, osobe s hemiparezom nakon moždanog udara imaju razne motoricke poremecaje kao sto su poremecaj misicnog tonusa, pojava asociranih reakcija i kompenzacijskih strategija. Uslijed ovih motorickih poremecaja osobe s hemiparezom nakon moždanog udara imat ce poteskoce pri hodanju, narusenu preciznost pokreta, nesposobnost pri držanju stvari, smanjenje balansa i koordinacije, umor misica te opce nezadovoljstvo i iscrpljenost. Nakon preboljenog moždanog udara uz motoricke poremecaje javljaju se senzoricki i kognitivni poremecaji, a depresija je također jedna od ucestalih komplikacija.

Although it is typically thought that a neurologic dysfunction means a focal lesion, symptoms of a brain disorder can be initiated by metabolic disruption such as from hyper- or hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, renal and hepatic injury, fatigue, and anesthesia. However, one of the most important causes of acute neurologic dysfunction is edema. Brain swelling is associated with the systemic inflammatory response and the passage of deformable microemboli. The larger question is whether acute symptoms associated with brain swelling because of a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier contributes to a long-term negative outcome caused by cell loss.",

      "title": "Mechanism of brain concussion, contusion and laceration",
      "abstract": "Injury to the head and intracranial structures may occur as a result of direct or indirect forces. An injury by a direct force occurs when an object strikes the head. Indirect injury to the head may take place when an object accelerates or decelerates the body, with injury to the head and contents occurring indirectly. The significance of direct and indirect types of injury lies in the fact that with direct injury, there is a greater likelihood of involvement of the head and contents only, whereas, in indirect injury to the head the entire body may be involved and the possibility of injury not only to the head but to other parts of the body as well is likely. As energy is absorbed by the head upon impact, the skull deforms and the head is either accelerated or decelerated. With regard to the production of injury the following may result. (a) There will be deformation of the skull with possible fracture or compression of the intracranial contents or both. This compression of the intracranial contents results from a decrease in the volume of the head due to deformation of the skull. (b) Sudden increase in intracranial pressure due to the acceleration or deceleration of the head at the time of impact; (c) mass movements of intracranial contents due to different acceleration rates of the skull and its contents; (d) distortion of the skull and dural septae as seen particularly in birth injuries; (e) shearing off a portion of the head without necessarily producing an appreciable increase in intracranial pressure; (f) shearing and tearing of intracranial contents due to greatly increased intracranial pressure as in bullet and shell fragment injuries; (g) a combination of any of these effects, (5). This last possibility is probably the most common mechanism as one or more of the above effects combine to cause the head injury in most cases. The injury to the head and intracranial contents occurs as a result of the following mechanisms: (a) There may be compression or squeezing of the tissues. (b) There may be tension or tearing apart of the tissues. (c) There may be shearing or sliding of the tissues over each other. These three mechanisms may operate simultaneously or in combination in different areas or in different directions in the same area. Concussion is a term describing a state of post-traumatic unconsciousness associated with pallor and a shock-like state in the human. It may be of varying intensity from completely recoverable states to those of continued coma and death. Concussion is caused by derangement of brain stem reticular formation. Open wounds of the head, contusions and lacerations of the brain may or may not be associated with concussion or such derangement. The mechanism of contusions and lacerations of the brain, electrical changes and chemical alterations after head injury are discussed and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The commonality of cognitive impairment and depression is discussed. Cognitive symptoms are the main symptoms of depressive disorder and, most often, it is cognitive impairment that reduces the performance and quality of life of depressed patients. The most common cognitive disorders in depressed patients are: attention deficit (both visual and auditory), decrease in the level of short-term and operative memory, difficulties in processing information of any modality, a decrease in the speed of information processing, as well as difficulties in building an activity program and monitoring her execution. A cognitive symptom that requires further discussion is the so-called cognitive distortion – a shift in focus from positive to negative stimuli, as well as incorrect reactions to negative feedback and decision making. A depressive episode develops against the background of dysmetabolic and dysfunctional cerebral changes in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and mediobasal frontal cortex. Cognitive impairment in patients who have had depression persists after recovery from depression; according to the figurative expression adopted in the scientific community of specialists studying cognitive impairment in depression, each depressive episode forms permanent “cognitive scars”. Presumably, cognitive dysfunction may be one of the risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder; depression, in turn, is a risk factor for the development of dementia, including in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease: studies have shown that the transformation of severe cognitive impairment associated with depression into dementia in elderly patients can reach 70% in five years. The undoubted commonality of depression and cognitive dysfunction is emphasized by the frequency of depression in patients with cognitive impairment.",

Conclusion:Concussion and its sequelae are still contestable, not only due to the lack of specificity, availability of studies and gold-standard biomarkers, but also due to its subjective nature in diagnosis, and its significant overlap with other physical, neurological and psychiatric conditions.",

MTBI typically occurs in males 15 to 24 years of age, and postconcussional sequelae may impede physical, emotional, social, marital, vocational, and avocational functioning. Usually the severity of the initial neurologic injury is defined according to the Glasgow Coma Score, the presence and duration of amnesia (retrograde and anterograde), and the alteration of loss of consciousness and its duration. MTBI is a traumatically induced physiological disruption of cerebral function manifested by at least one of the following: loss of consciousness no longer than 20 minutes; any loss of memory; any alteration in mental status at the time of the accident; physical symptoms that potentially are related to the brain; and development of posttraumatic cognitive deficits not accounted for by emotional factors. When a patient presents with multisystem trauma, impairments may involve several parts of the body, including the nervous system. Individual impairments of other systems should be calculated separately and their whole person values combined using the Combined Values Chart in AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment . At present, no ideal system can rate impairment following MTBI, and physicians must thoroughly understand both the underlying disease process and the associated injuries.",

      "abstract": "Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an acquired condition that presents with psychiatric and physical manifestations that carry significant morbidity, with neuropsychiatric complications usually outweighing neuro-physical complications as the major cause of disability after TBI. These complications significantly influence the post-TBI recovery trajectory, inhibiting cognitive and functional rehabilitation, increasing suicide risk and potentially leading to higher mortality rates. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the epidemiology and global burden of TBI, its types and causes, its underlying mechanisms and pathology, how to assess its severity and the variety of neuropsychiatric sequelae of TBI and their management. Results TBI can trigger a spectrum of neuropsychiatric complications that can range from concussion, post-concussion syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy to emotional disorders (pathological laughing and crying, affective lability and irritability) to cognitive deficits to behavioural disorders (disinhibition, aggression and apathy) and to psychiatric disorders (depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis and sleep disorders). Conclusions Neuropsychiatric sequelae arising from TBI are prevalent, intricate, and often lead to substantial functional and social impairment, requiring a blend of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The varied and long-lasting impacts of TBI underlie the necessity for ongoing, tailored management strategies, prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Brain injuries may be the basis of long-term impairments in physical, social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning, including executive functioning. If the TBI led to a loss of consciousness, there will be an enduring, dense amnesia for the unconscious time period. Following a TBI, there is great variability in the types of cognitive deficits and the severity of those deficits depending on which areas of the brain have been affected. It is extremely challenging to integrate a patient's history of head trauma into the overall picture of an individual's clinical situation, including the psychosocial consequences of the traumatic injury.

      "abstract": "Abstract Antenatal destructive events affecting the central nervous system of the foetus lead to disruptive brain lesions that are often associated with impaired neurodevelopment. The pathogenesis of these lesions encompasses a range of causes, including haemorrhagic, embolic, or other vascular events; exposure to teratogens, such as drugs or substance abuse; congenital brain infections; genetic conditions; and metabolic disorders. Cranial ultrasonography is the first‐line imaging modality to diagnose these antepartum brain lesions in the newborn infant; it is often complemented by brain magnetic resonance imaging to detect associated neuronal dysmigration and dysplasia. Using a pictorial approach, a differential diagnosis of foetal disruptive brain lesions and common findings related to antenatal brain damage can be made, including antenatal haemorrhagic and ischaemic brain injuries, porencephaly, schizencephaly, multicystic encephalomalacia, and hydranencephaly, as well as germinolytic cysts and lenticulostriate vasculopathy. The main conditions associated with foetal brain disruption, such as genetic cerebral vascular diseases, monochorionic twin pregnancies, congenital heart disease, maternal drug use, congenital infections, and inborn errors of metabolism can be used to illustrate typical imaging patterns that, when combined with clinical presentation, can assist in identifying the underlying mechanisms and causes, thus supporting individualized patient management.",

The result is a heterogeneous spectrum of motor abnormalities that manifests as an abnormal broad-based gait, incoordination, tremor, dysarthria, and motor and autonomic dysfunction. Some studies have found that urinary dysfunction in patients with genetically defined causes of spinocerebellar ataxia was very rare. Urodynamic abnormality, either an overactive, underactive detrusor, or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, was identified in 87% of patients, and 61% of them had Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome-related neurologic problems.

The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

      "title": "Birth transitions: Pathophysiology, the onset of consciousness and possible implications for neonatal maladjustment syndrome in the foal",
      "abstract": "Neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS), also known as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, perinatal asphyxia syndrome and neonatal encephalopathy 1, 2, is reportedly the most common problem observed in neonatal foals during the first 72 h after birth 2. Neurological signs of NMS can range from subtle to severe and may include convulsions/seizures, weakness and behavioural abnormalities 3. While in severe cases an early death is likely, recovery is possible with human intervention, especially in less severe cases 1, 4. Neonatal maladjustment syndrome is mainly attributed to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia leading to neuronal cell death shortly before, during or after birth 1, 2, 4. Signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease in equine neonatal patients have been attributed to hypoxic encephalopathy in 92% of cases, of which 59% experienced dystocia or premature placental separation 5. Other possible causes may include post natal persistence of or reversion to an inhibited fetal state of cerebral cortical function 2 and meningitis, congenital lesions, CNS haemorrhage or oedema, metabolic insults, sepsis, endotoxins, and in utero infections 6. Thus, NMS appears to represent a number of different but related conditions that reflect untoward responses to the exceptional physiological challenges that precede, accompany and follow expulsion from the uterus at birth. In line with the distinction made by Aleman et al. 2, the focus of this editorial will be the impact of variations in the oxygen status of the foal 7 and their suggestion that a fetal state of inhibited cerebral cortical function may be retained or return after birth 2. Although the latter area is of more contemporary interest 2, 8, both merit consideration because their effects may interact. The first area relates to established pathophysiological causes of impaired perinatal oxygen status and its various impacts on metabolic and other processes that support neonatal heat production 7. The second area concerns less well-recognised changes in the physiological environment of the brain during the transition of the young from the intrauterine to the extrauterine environment, in particular the impact of that on post natal levels of arousal and the onset of consciousness 9-11. Hindrances to the successful completion of this transition in brain function would jeopardise the newborn's capacity to interact with its physical environment and mother in ways that otherwise promote its survival and well-being. Finally, in addition to emphasising the above 2 areas, consideration will be limited to mild cases of NMS where brain function is only temporarily affected and is therefore reversibly inhibited. The well demonstrated prenatal increase in fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) activity is important for integrating 4 key processes. They are the onset of labour, an acceleration of fetal tissue maturation just before birth, the timely onset of colostrum/milk production by the mother, and a physiologically generated impetus to engage in mother–young bonding 12. All of these processes are crucial for neonatal survival, which is jeopardised if one or more of them is impaired. Moreover, superimposed on these processes may be negative impacts of pathophysiological and related conditions that arise as a result of placental insufficiency, intrapartum hypoxia, dystocia, premature birth, starvation of the newborn and maternal underfeeding. Each one of these has been discussed in detail elsewhere 7, 12, 13 and has been identified as relevant to some manifestations of NMS 1-4. Hypothermia is often observed shortly after outdoor births of ungulate young, is a common outcome of perinatal pathophysiology, may often be severe and predisposes the newborn to death or debility (Table 1). Importantly, in the context of managing impaired newborns, hypothermia of as little as 2–3°C is anticipated to result in some dulling of consciousness, and this in its turn may contribute to the reduced behavioural responsiveness of chilled newborns to their mothers 7. Hypothermia occurs in healthy vigorous newborns that mount full heat production responses to ambient cold that is so severe that heat loss still exceeds heat production. In contrast, hypoxia associated with placental insufficiency or dystocia can inhibit heat production sufficiently to cause hypothermia even at mild ambient temperatures. This inhibition is associated with various consequences of anaerobic metabolism as indicated by elevated concentrations of plasma lactate and hydrogen ions and evidence of metabolic and respiratory acidosis 14-16, and it is rarely associated with cerebral lesions 17, 18. The newborn may also be predisposed to hypothermia by immature shivering and nonshivering thermogenic mechanisms and/or by reduced energy reserves available to fuel heat production 13, 17, 19. Moreover, such immature newborns may be further disadvantaged by high rates of heat loss due to a high surface area to body weight ratio. Immaturity of other organ systems may also adversely affect their survival. Practically, however, normothermia can usually be restored and maintained by initially keeping most such newborns at air temperatures near the upper limit of their species-specific thermoneutral range 7, 12. Chronic fetal hypoxia Fetal undernutrition Fetal growth retardation Hypothermia Low birthweight Failure to suck due to weakness, competition, inadequate mothering Deficient production of colostrum/milk Hypoglycaemia Inhibited heat production Hypothermia in cold conditions Cerebral compromise in warm environments Infection Immature thermogenic mechanisms Reduced thyroidal and adrenocortical support of post natal metabolic activity Restricted placental size Fetal growth retardation Reduced deposition of fetal fat reserves Inadequate maternal udder development and colostrum/milk production Inhibition of or impaired heat production Excessive heat loss Hypoglycaemia Hypothermia Infection Energy-rich nutrients are required to fuel heat production and these are derived from body energy reserves deposited before birth and from colostrum/milk drunk after birth 19-21. Starvation or inadequate colostrum/milk intakes lead to hypoglycaemia as body energy reserves become depleted, and the onset of hypoglycaemia in such newborns may be more rapid in intensive care units because the warm conditions would usually inhibit shivering and its glucose-sparing effects 19. Severe hypoglycaemia in warm conditions will eventually lead to cerebral compromise as indicated by seizure activity, while in cold conditions it will inhibit heat production and usually lead to hypothermia 7, 19. In addition, it is well known that starvation deprives newborns of immunoglobulins and thus predisposes them to infections that can result in a variety of debilitating, often fatal, conditions 7. The routine intensive management of NMS foals is obviously directed at specifically minimising such problems. Interestingly, the volumes of colostrum required to meet the newborn's energy needs 19 will substantially exceed the minimum necessary to provide sufficient immunoglobulins for reasonable protection against many neonatal infections. As already mentioned, NMS is commonly associated with encephalopathy due to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia shortly before, during or after birth. However, it has been suggested that in some mild cases of NMS, where a normal birth has apparently occurred and the NMS newborns have recovered quickly and fully from the condition, other factors may be at play 2. In particular these may include a post natal persistence of fetal physiological conditions linked to aberrant activity of the fetal HPA axis and/or elevated pregnane concentrations 2. This intriguing suggestion raises the possibility that factors other than hypoxia may impair or delay the onset of consciousness after birth of some NMS foals. If so, this would reduce their capacity to engage in survival-critical volitional behaviour, and this would be the case whether they were kept outdoors or indoors in a stall or a neonatal care unit. It also emphasises the value of developing interventions that would help caregivers to more effectively manage this transitional period in such foals. Integrated analyses of the literature suggest that ungulate fetuses, which are neurologically mature at birth, are actively maintained in sleep-like, unconscious states despite the fact that their brains have attained the capacity for conscious perception before birth 9-11, 22. Maintenance of such unconscious states is apparently due to the combined neuroinhibitory effects of high circulating and cerebral concentrations of adenosine, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and prostaglandin D2 acting together with a placental neuroinhibitory peptide, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation 9-11 (Table 2). Therefore, conscious perception is not anticipated to occur until shortly after birth in these species. Potent neuroinhibitor promoting sleep and unconsciousness Responds rapidly due to very short biological half-life Demonstrated inhibition of cerebral cortical electrical activity Placental and fetal tissues including the brain High circulating levels in fetus Production varies with fetal oxygen status – elevated in hypoxia, reduced in normoxia Allopregnanolone Pregnanolone Neuroactive steroidal metabolites of progesterone Act via GABAA receptors to bring about sedative/hypnotic and anaesthetic effects Produced by the fetal brain and the placenta from progesterone and cholesterol High circulating levels in fetus Elevated during stress and hypoxia Produced by the fetal brain Present in cerebrospinal fluid in fetal sheep during late pregnancy These observations raise the question of how the post natal onset of consciousness is achieved in healthy newborns. Key factors are considered to include a reduction in cerebral cortical inhibition by factors that are unique to life in utero, as well as to an increase in cerebral cortical activation associated with birth 9, 10. Thus, a marked elevation of tissue oxygen concentrations in response to the onset of successful breathing after birth and the loss of the placenta as a source of circulating adenosine are both considered to lead to a rapid decrease in circulating and cerebral adenosine concentrations and to a decrease in an overriding adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical function 9. Loss of the placenta at birth would also contribute by removing a significant source of allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and their precursors, and the only source of the placental peptide neuroinhibitor. The rapid post natal removal of this neuroinhibition, especially that due to adenosine, is presumed to allow a suite of activators of cerebral cortical function to operate. The combined effect of these activators is presumed to be sufficient to overcome residual but declining inhibitory effects of the neuroactive steroids which persist for some time after the rapid decline in the overriding adenosine inhibition has occurred 9, 23. Activators of arousal observed in newborns include high circulating levels of 17β-oestradiol, which is mostly of placental origin, and stimulation of the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system by strong intrapartum tactile stimulation and hypoxia and by post partum exposure to cold ambient conditions 24, 25. The neuroactive steroid 17β-oestradiol has rapid-onset excitatory effects in a variety of brain areas 26, 27. The locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system extends noradrenergic nerves widely throughout the brain and has major roles in stimulating arousal and alert vigilance 28. In addition, neurons of the locus coeruleus project to the olfactory bulb so that activation of this nucleus may facilitate teat-seeking and bonding in neonatal animals 29, 30. With the successful onset of breathing after birth, 17β-oestradiol and noradrenaline presumably act together with cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors, and with tactile stimulation through contact with hard surfaces and maternal licking, to promote the first appearance of consciousness 9, 10. Arousal is observed in the normal healthy newborn within minutes of birth and accompanies the onset of breathing 31. This is followed by volitional behaviours suggestive of some level of conscious perception, such as interactions with the dam, standing successfully and then teat seeking. Arousal and the associated onset of breathing are essential for survival; in their absence the newborn will rapidly become hypoxic/hypercapnic and die 31. In addition, behaviours of the newborn that contribute to mother–young bonding and help to secure adequate colostrum/milk intake are equally important when human intervention is not possible 7, 19. Behaviours associated with survival become possible by the time of birth in precocial young because their neurological apparatus has developed sufficiently to process sensory inputs from the environment, allowing them to find the dam and a teat, or even to seek shelter in cold conditions 31. Such behaviours, which may initially reflect innate drives, are indicative of arousal and the onset of consciousness. Factors associated with hypothermia that adversely affect this process and thereby threaten newborn survival include the pathophysiological states listed in Table 1. Relationships between these factors and associated key features of NMS foals have been summarised in Figure 1. Clearly, NMS foals are usually managed clinically in ways designed to minimise these problems 2. The point here, of course, is to clarify whether or not a possible delay in the progression from prenatal unconsciousness to post natal consciousness occurs independently of hypoxia in some NMS foals, a condition that would manifest functionally as retention of an inhibited state of fetal cerebral cortical activity as suggested by Aleman et al. 2. Such a demonstration is made somewhat more complex because persistent hypoxia also delays the usually rapid post natal reduction in adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical activity 9, 11. Intersection between some key features of neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) foals and hypoxia, hypothermia, starvation, hypoglycaemia and state of consciousness. See text for details. For example, many of the foals showing clinical signs of CNS impairment are likely to have experienced one or both of 2 forms of hypoxic insult. They are chronic hypoxia caused by placental insufficiency associated with a small placental size or other placental impairments that reduce its oxygen transfer capacity over an extended period, and acute hypoxia during birth resulting from dystocia and/or premature separation of the placenta. Interestingly, 12 of the 32 NMS foals observed by Aleman et al. 2 were reported to have had a clinical history of acute hypoxia of these types. Nevertheless, the aetiology of hypoxic influences on the state of consciousness and on commonly observed behaviour in NMS foals, such as lack of affinity for the mare, absence of sucking and weakness 4, is likely to be quite complex. This is because such influences probably involve at least 2 factors acting separately or together. First, where neonatal breathing is not compromised, persistent inhibitory effects of prepartum or intrapartum hypoxia on heat-producing mechanisms would often lead to hypothermia which has the capacity to dull consciousness due to its specific thermal effects on cerebral metabolic rate 7. Of course, providing sufficient thermal support to maintain normothermia would rule out this possibility. The second factor is a subtle involvement of hypoxia in some mild cases of NMS which appear to manifest as a post partum continuation of an inhibited fetal cerebral cortical status, or a reversion to such a state after apparently normal post natal arousal and activity have occurred 2. This might arise if respiratory function remained suboptimal from birth or if such suboptimal function appeared after a successful post partum onset of optimal function. In either case, the potent neuroinhibitory effects of adenosine and/or the pregnane steroid metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone might be anticipated to persist straight after birth or return later, because their concentrations are reported to increase during hypoxia and other stressful situations 11, 32. If this did occur, such inhibition might override activation of cerebral cortical activity resulting from 17β-oestradiol, noradrenaline, strong tactile stimulation and, if thermal support is not provided, by cold exposure. This possibility could be ruled out and/or managed by continuous monitoring of oxygen status and, if required, by providing respiratory support. A third possibility, which accords with the proposal of Aleman et al. 2, is that a post natal persistence or return of a fetal state of cerebral cortical inhibition may occur in normoxic NMS foals. Of the 32 NMS foals in their study, there was no clinical history of hypoxia in 12. However, clarifying the aetiology of NMS in 6 of these was somewhat complicated by other clinically significant factors, whereas the remaining 6 foals apparently exhibited none 2. It is understood of course that heterogeneity of study groups is usual when they are made up of clinical cases acquired serendipitously. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the group of 32 NMS foals provides interesting information 2. First, the plasma neuroactive steroid concentrations exhibited far greater ranges in the NMS foals than in healthy ones. This presumably reflected their heterogeneity and raises the possibility that some of the subgroups considered above might be found to have significantly different hormone profiles once they have been identified and studied in sufficient numbers. Second, progesterone, as a precursor of allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, has neuroinhibitory actions 8, 9, 11 and is therefore of particular interest here because, to the present authors' knowledge, none of the other steroids reported to be significantly elevated in NMS foals 2 have documented neuroinhibitory actions. The elevated plasma concentrations of progesterone are consistent with dulled consciousness 33-35, but the exceptionally low, and therefore unreported 2 concentrations of allopregnanolone are not. Third, although the mechanisms remain elusive at present 2, the significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of pregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and epitestosterone, as well as progesterone, do indicate different patterns of steroidogenesis and/or clearance, and support the view of Aleman et al. 2 that after further investigation and validation such hormone profiles might become useful aids to diagnosing some types of NMS. Fourth, the behavioural evidence of cerebral cortical inhibition in NMS foals 2, considered in the context of an apparent requirement for the withdrawal of neuroinhibition to be accompanied by increasing neuroactivation if birth is to be followed by the timely onset of consciousness 9-11, raises the prospect of testing the therapeutic efficacy of potent neuroactivators in some NMS foals. One candidate is 17β-oestradiol because of evidence that it could promote behavioural arousal, breathing and subsequent survival in lambs that were initially 'flat' or inactive after delivery by hysterectomy close to the time of normal birth 36. Another candidate is the use of strong tactile stimulation to elicit locus coeruleus–noradrenaline mediated neuroactivation. A suggested way to achieve such tactile stimulation (J.E. Madigan, personal communication) is to use a modified soft rope 'squeeze' technique to simulate compression of the young by the cervix and vagina during birth 37, a natural process that is known to strongly stimulate the locus coeruleus 9, 11. It is apparent from these observations that the fresh perspectives provided by the notion that inhibited fetal states of cerebral cortical function may persist or return after birth in some NMS foals, as outlined by Aleman et al. 2, lays open several fruitful lines of investigation. In building on earlier insights into the onset of consciousness in other neurologically mature young shortly after an uneventful birth 9-11, 31, such investigations, as is usual in their early stages, are likely to constructively generate more interesting questions than they provide answers, but answers do eventually become clear. So, watch this space!",

Common mental symptoms include: depression and other mood disorders, irritability, emotional lability, paroxysms of laughter or crying, and paranoid thinking. Physical functioning often is affected. The presenting physical symptoms consist of the focal findings associated with the areas of brain cell damage. Consequently, the physical symptoms are highly variable from individual to individual. The presentation of this disorder is extremely variable and depends on the site of actual damage to the brain, the extent of the damage, and the timing of events that lead to neuronal cell death. Strokes are almost always unmistakable medical crises, while transient ischemic attacks are more easily dismissed by patients as insignificant because they are transient.",

      "title": "Disturbed Balance of Inhibitory Signaling Links Hearing Loss and Cognition",
      "abstract": "Neuronal hyperexcitability in the central auditory pathway linked to reduced inhibitory activity is associated with numerous forms of hearing loss, including noise damage, age-dependent hearing loss, and deafness, as well as tinnitus or auditory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In most cases, the reduced central inhibitory activity and the accompanying hyperexcitability are interpreted as an active compensatory response to the absence of synaptic activity, linked to increased central neural gain control (increased output activity relative to reduced input). We here suggest that hyperexcitability also could be related to an immaturity or impairment of tonic inhibitory strength that typically develops in an activity-dependent process in the ascending auditory pathway with auditory experience. In these cases, high-SR auditory nerve fibers, which are critical for the shortest latencies and lowest sound thresholds, may have either not matured (possibly in congenital deafness or autism) or are dysfunctional (possibly after sudden, stressful auditory trauma or age-dependent hearing loss linked with cognitive decline). Fast auditory processing deficits can occur despite maintained basal hearing. In that case, tonic inhibitory strength is reduced in ascending auditory nuclei, and fast inhibitory parvalbumin positive interneuron (PV-IN) dendrites are diminished in auditory and frontal brain regions. This leads to deficits in central neural gain control linked to hippocampal LTP/LTD deficiencies, cognitive deficits, and unbalanced extra-hypothalamic stress control. Under these conditions, a diminished inhibitory strength may weaken local neuronal coupling to homeostatic vascular responses required for the metabolic support of auditory adjustment processes. We emphasize the need to distinguish these two states of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in hearing disorders: (i) Under conditions of preserved fast auditory processing and sustained tonic inhibitory strength, an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance following auditory deprivation can maintain precise hearing through a memory linked, transient disinhibition that leads to enhanced spiking fidelity (central neural gain⇑) (ii) Under conditions of critically diminished fast auditory processing and reduced tonic inhibitory strength, hyperexcitability can be part of an increased synchronization over a broader frequency range, linked to reduced spiking reliability (central neural gain⇓). This latter stage mutually reinforces diminished metabolic support for auditory adjustment processes, increasing the risks for canonical dementia syndromes.",

Attention encompasses generalized activation of the cognitive processes of orienting, filtering, and selecting inputs; preparing for action; and maintaining thought on a stimulus, mental activity, or goal. Attention, a vital foundation for higher cognitive functions, maintains a coherent stream of thought. The ability to sustain attention, or vigilance, is necessary for complex behaviors, such as understanding and remembering a story. Therefore, attention must be tested first, before other cognitive functions. An inattentive patient’s failure to perform calculations sheds no light on arithmetic skills. Rather, attentional dysfunction is a central feature of syndromes due to diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, as well as syndromes due to focal cerebral damage such as the neglect syndrome.

Brain trauma has a relatively poor prognosis and such patients will often have reduced work ability and a high possibility to stay temporarily or permanently disabled. That is why such injuries are a major public health issue since even less severe brain injuries can result in permanent neuropsychological disorders that affect work ability and quality of life. Traumatic injury can be divided into two phases, primary and secondary. Primary injury is the result of the mechanical force that acts upon the head and brain structures. The development of secondary injury begins after the emergence of the primary and lasts for several days. During this period the damage increases and it is of vital importance to try to reduce the extent of the damage to the affected tissue. Hyperoxia is defined as a greater than normal oxygen percent in the tissues and organs, caused by increased delivery of oxygen or increased percentage o fit in the arterial blood. It can be achieved in normobaric and hyperbaric conditions. Normobaric hyperoxia is achieved under atmospheric conditions, whereas hyperbaric is achieved at pressures higher than atmospheric.\r\nIn the treatment of traumatic brain injury, the main goal is to preserve brain function and reduce the extent of tissue damage. Most important thing is, except ICP control, to maintain proper tissue perfusion and to provide aerobic metabolism.

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique.

Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "abstract": "Foot drop can be defined as a significant weakness in ankle and toe dorsiflexion. Injury to the dorsiflexors or to any point along the neural pathways that supply these muscles can result in a foot drop. Injury to the peroneal nerve is usually the major precipitant. Other causes vary from trauma to surgical nerve injury, as well as leg compartment syndromes or dorsiflexor injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, stroke, neuropathies, drug toxicities, spinal stenosis, L5 sciaticas, systemic diseases such as connective tissue diseases, vasculidities, or diabetes. This report focuses on a patient presenting with a foot drop as an unusual manifestation of brain metastasis. His minimal symptomatology seemed to point towards a local process. Therefore, early recognition and prompt treatment are essential. The central nervous system must be the target of investigations when the workup fails to disclose the proper etiology. Potential diagnostic delays may occur. Certain cases may require a more aggressive approach.",

      "abstract": "Summary In the long term after traumatic brain injury, the most disabling problems are generally related to neuropsychiatric sequelae, including personality change and cognitive impairment, rather than neurophysical sequelae. Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage. Anxiety and depression symptoms are quite frequent and play a role in the development of persistent post-concussion syndrome after milder injury. Depression may be associated with a deterioration in disability over time after injury. Psychosis is not unusual though it has been difficult to confirm that traumatic brain injury is a cause of schizophrenia. Head injury may, many years later, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Good rehabilitation probably minimizes the risk of psychiatric sequelae, but specific psychological and pharmacological treatments may be needed.",

Motor neuron disease is not a topic readily chosen by screenwriters, and when it is used, it seems to fall into the general categories of \"severe disability\" and \"dying from an untreatable disorder.\" In The Hawaiians, there is a very brief scene showing crippled lepers separated on an island who are pushed away by the lead actor in the film.

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain arises from a lesion in the somatosensory system, which includes peripheral nerves, spinal dorsal horn, ascending projection tracts, thalamus, the somatosensory cortex and other painprocessing brain region. Patients with neuropathic pain have neurosensory defecits as a consequence of their direct neural injury with positivesensory phenomena (i.e., hyperalgesia, allodyneia, dysthesia and paresthesia). Paresthesia is a variety of neuropathic pain arises as a spontaneous and abnormal sensation. The problem may arise from an abnormality anywhere along the sensory pathway from the peripheral nerves to the sensory cortex. Paresthesia are often described as pins-and-needle sensation. Particular kinds of paresthesias can be seen in the central nervous system (CNS) as follows: focal sensory seizures with cortical lesions, spontaneous pain in the thalamic syndrome, or bursts of paresthesia down the back or into the arms upon flexing the neck (Lhermitte’s sign) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or other disorders of the cervical spinal cord. Level lesions of the spinal cord may cause either a band sensation or a girdle sensation, a vague sense of awareness of altered sensation encircling the abdomen. Nerve root lesions or isolated peripheral nerve lesions may also cause paresthesia, but the most intense and annoying paresthesia is due to a multiple symmetric peripheral neuropathy (polyneuropathy). Dysesthesia or allodynia is the term for abnormal sensations ordinarily evoked by a nonnoxious stimuli. Paresthesias may be transient (following a prolonged crossing of patients leg) and not associated with neurological abnormality; however, if paresthesias are persistent, sensory system abnormality should be ruled out. In recent years, there has been expanded insight in to the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain because of their multiple and complex pathophysiological mechanisms. Convincing evidence on the relationship between the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and neuropathic pain symptoms now suggests that classifying neuropathic pain according to a mechanism-based rather than an etiology-based approach. So we will try to explain the mechanism of paresthesia in this chapter.",

      "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? It provides an overview of the recent papers linking brain neurotransmission with exercise-induced and/or mental fatigue. What advances does it highlight? The noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue during prolonged exercise, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. 2) Mental fatigue affects several neurotransmitter systems, with presumably an important role for dopamine and adenosine, in multiple brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.In sports and exercise science, fatigue is an elusive concept that has important implications in performance during exercise. It has been described in many ways (tiredness, exhaustion, lethargy or weariness) and describes a physical and/or mental state of being tired and lack of energy. Exercise-induced fatigue can be defined as an acute impairment of exercise performance, and a distinction has been made between peripheral and central fatigue. Mental fatigue can be defined as a psychobiological state caused by prolonged exertion that has the potential to reduce cognitive performance and exercise performance. Recent studies have given clear indications that brain catecholamines are involved in the onset of fatigue during endurance exercise. Evidence is provided indicating that the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. Brain neurotransmission is also suggested to play an important role in mental fatigue. Several neurotransmitter systems might be implicated (with the most important role for dopamine and adenosine) in multiple brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and the summation of these alterations might explain the impairment in endurance performance in a mentally fatigued state. Obviously, we have to keep in mind that fatigue is a very complex construct and that, besides brain neurochemistry, several other factors play a role in its onset.",

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury - an Intellectual's Need for Cognitive Rehabilitation",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injuries can happen at anytime, to anyone. A traumatic brian injury (TBI) occurs when the brain has undergone sudden injury. Traumatic brain injuries may occur when incidents such as strokes, gunshot wounds, physical assaults, sports, car accidents, falls, bicycle and motorcycle accidents, as well as when pedestrians are hit by vehicles cause damage to an individual's brain. Doctors, teachers, cognitive therapists, and health care professionals don't always recognize or properly diagnose the problems that arise for a traumatic brain injured individual: moreover, the intellectual who has suffered a traumatic brain injury does receive the proper cognitive retraining. The professionals think nothing is wrong with the individual because s/he functions at such a high level. Dr. Thomas Kay, in his article, What You Should Know About 'The Unseen Injury: Minor Head Trauma', stated the nerve cell damage can be widespread and microscopic, appearing on diagnostic radiographic imageries or on neurological testings. He also stated a person's intelligence could still be measured as average or above average, yet their cognitive abilities are as they once were. This possible inability to recognize the intellectual TBI's cognitive difficulties since the injury is frustrating to the intellectual TBI, because they know something is a miss cognitively. Dr. Kay advises patients, not to fall victim to being told you are malingering or imagining your symptoms. Mary Ellen Jennison, in her report, Able: Academic Bridges to Learning Effectiveness, supports the need for curriculum and programs geared to college students and the higher functioning TBI individuals. She outlined Project Able's program in which their curriculum and services assist the TBIs to attend/succeed in collegiate endeavors and re-enter the work force. Jennison stated that educators have little knowledge about head injuries. Kay discussed, in his paper, Selection and Outcome Criteria for Community-Based Employment: Perspectives, Methodological Problems and Options, how TBI rehabilitators should pick up whatever tool is closest at hand in the rehabilitation of the TBI, but should custom tailor the cognitive retraining to the individual. Without this custom tailoredness, the intellectual TBI emerges from cognitive retraining with little/no assistance for their cognitive deficits. Contusions to the head, skull fractures, or skull lacerations are necessary components for a person to have undergone a TBI. A car accident in which a person has suffered a whiplash, a sudden jerk to the head, can results in a TBI without the person's head ever hitting anything. The brain can rotate violently or bounce off the skull's inner walls, reacting similarly as when a bowl full of coagulated gelatin is shaken, causing stretching or snapping of microscopic fibers, axons, which send messages to nerve cells, neurons, within the brain. This disturbance to the mental functioning within the brain is called a concussion, even if the disturbance is brief. The person need loose consciousness to suffer a concussion. During the concussion the axons can stretch, twist, bend, or snap. Some axons may swell or even disintegrate. The axons transmit brain messages. The myelin sheath surrounding and insulating the axons can also be damaged or destroyed in the same fashion as the axons. Concussions are now classified according to symptoms: grade 1 concussion - seeing stars, the person remains conscious, only momentary confusion, headaches, dizziness, some short-term memory loss, head clears quickly, no medical intervention. grade 2 concussion - amnesia, nausea, ringing in the ears grade 3 concussion - unconsciousness Rest allows the brain to attempt to heal itself from a concussion. There are more neurons within the brain that were previously used. Rest permits the brain to replace or repair the nerve connections. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that primarily impacts movement and balance, as well as the autonomic nervous system. While traditionally not associated with cognitive decline, recent evidence indicates cognitive impairment is part of the disease process, typically manifesting as attentional and executive function deficits, alongside learning/memory impairments. This case contributes to MSA literature by describing mild cognitive changes in a patient with predominant autonomic dysfunction. Method A 68-year-old Caucasian man exhibited progressive cognitive changes over 2–3 years, with concerns emerging 5–10 years prior to neurological consultation (e.g., forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, decline in ability to follow complex instructions). Predominant sensorimotor/physiological changes included chronic constipation, vasovagal episodes, hearing loss, orthostatic hypotension, transient vision loss, and mild dysphagia. Neuroimaging showed nonspecific mild pontine T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Significant family history of dementia. Results Evaluation showed mostly normal cognitive function with some decline in executive functioning (slowed processing, reduced problem-solving, set loss, task rigidity) and mild memory decline. Despite scores within normal limits, performance likely reflects cognitive change consistent with his subjective experience, possibly masked by strong cognitive reserve (high educational and occupational attainment, research interests, social engagement). Conclusions Although lacking frank impairment, the patient’s history suggests a neurological process (i.e., synucleinopathy such as MSA) including history of REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic symptoms/conditions, and neuroimaging findings suggestive of brain stem involvement. Neuropsychological evaluation is critical in differentiating MSA from other Parkinsons’s plus syndromes, as it typically presents with fewer cognitive impairments.",

When individuals develop depressive symptoms, it is important to rule out a major depressive disorder. Depression symptoms or major depressive disorder following concussion will lead to persistent post-concussive symptoms that may be misinterpreted as a more severe brain injury. Persistent depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder require specific nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management, as warranted.",

It reflects a constellation of dynamic biological mechanisms, including neurotransmitter imbalance, macro- and microcirculatory dysfunction resulting in ischaemia, endothelial activation, alteration of the blood-brain barrier impairment with passage of neurotoxic mediators, activation of microglial cells within the central nervous system, cumulatively resulting in a neuroinflammatory state. Sepsis-associated brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality and long-term cognitive decline, whose mechanisms might include microglial activation, axonopathy, or cerebral microinfarction. There is no specific treatment, other than the management of the underlying septic source, correction of physiological and metabolic abnormalities, and limiting the use of medications with neurotoxic effects.",

The Mini Mental State Examination is the most commonly used routine test for cerebral function. Enhanced neurologic examination is performed especially in patients presenting with symptoms relevant to neurologic abnormality. This comprises a detailed description and examination starting from consciousness to small reflexes. The Glasgow Coma Scale is the most commonly and widely used scale for grading the consciousness level though its predictive value is very limited mainly due to observer variability. Cranial nerve evaluation gives doctors knowledge regarding the specific cranial nerves involved, the site of the lesion, interference with anesthesia management if any, and other postoperative complications. Any abnormality in physical movements such as dysdiadochokinesis, ataxia, and tremor indicates cerebellar lesion, for example, tumor, ischemia, or infarction. Motor function consists of three components: muscle tone, muscle strength, and muscle consistency.",

A few cases of Jactatio nocturna have been considered manifestations of sleep disorder, and an analogy to somnambulism and pavor nocturnus has been suggested. We observed episodes of Jactatio nocturna in a patient with global encephalopathy and frontal lobe dysfunction after closed head injury, and successfully treated these with imipramine. Sleep disorders are increasingly recognized after head injury; Jactatio nocturna must be differentiated from post-traumatic seizures, and may represent partial or defective arousal during light non-REM sleep, analogous to the parasomnias of deeper sleep and possibly representing dysfunction of frontal arousal mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "textabstractPerinatal asphyxia is an important cause of brain injury. It may\r\nlead to hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) which occurs in one to\r\nsix of every 1000 full term births. The risk of death or severe handicap is\r\n0.5-2.0 out of 1000. Following intrapartum asphyxia cerebral hypoperfusion\r\nin combination with hypoxia produces characteristic neuropathological\r\nchanges and related clinical signs. After the primary insult\r\nthere is a thirty minutes period of reperfusion characterized by the partial\r\nrecovery of cell and metabolic processes. This is followed by a latent\r\nphase which may last up to six hours. In this phase oxidative metabolism\r\n(near) normalizes (shown by MRspectroscopy) but EEG activity is depressed\r\nand the blood flow is likely to be reduced. Secondary energy failure\r\nand secondary hyperperfusion (‘luxury perfusion’) may occur in the\r\nneonatal brain within 6-15 hours after an acute ischaemic insult, marked\r\nby the acute onset of seizures (peaking at about 12 hours post insult).\r\nExcitotoxins accumulate in the cell and cell death may take 72 hours to\r\ncompletion. The infant’s gestational age and thus the maturational\r\nstage of the brain, as well as type, severity and duration of the insult are\r\ndeterminants of the brain injury. During the insult there is redistribution\r\nof blood flow to the brain, heart and adrenals. Our current understanding\r\nof perinatal asphyxia is based on animal experiments. Different and\r\nmixed etiologies lead to a range of post asphyxial patterns, usually subdivided\r\ninto different patterns; acute, chronic or a combination of these\r\ntwo. With chronic, possibly repetitive insults, lesions are predominantly\r\nseen in (sub)cortical structures. This has been named watershed injury\r\nfor its classical distribution along the borderzones between the major\r\npial arteries, sparing thalamus and basal ganglia. From the literature it\r\nappears that watershed injury is observed most frequently in context\r\nof term birth asphyxia. In acute and (near) total asphyxia the damage is\r\nmostly to the thalami, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, brain\r\nstem and specific areas of the neocortex like the rolandic, calcarine and\r\ninsular cortex.",

In cases of surgical exploration of UE nerve injuries, nearly one-third demonstrate a transected or discontinuous nerve.» Existing literature regarding surgical management of nerve injuries secondary to GSWs comes from both military and civilian injuries. Outcomes are inconsistently reported, and indications are heterogeneous; however, reasonable results can be obtained with nerve reconstruction.» Our proposed management algorithm hinges on 4 treatment questions: if there is a nerve deficit present on examination, if there is a concomitant injury in the extremity (i.e., fracture or vascular insult), whether the injured nerve would be in the operative field of the concomitant injury, and whether there was an identified nerve lesion encountered at the time of surgery by another surgeon?» Early exploration rather than continued expectant management may offer improved recovery from GSW nerve injuries in particular situations.

The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Kognitive Defizite können bei vielen neurologischen Erkrankungen in deren Verlauf nachgewiesen werden. Dabei gibt es häufig eine Assoziation zwischen erkrankten ZNS-Regionen und den kognitiven Defiziten. Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt einen Überblick über kognitive Defizite bei neurodegenerativen, neuroinflammatorischen und vaskulären Erkrankungen sowie bei Epilepsie. Es bleibt festzuhalten, dass neben der Anamnese eine eingehende neuropsychologische Testung die wichtigste Untersuchung zur Diagnose kognitiver Defizite darstellt. Weiterhin ist wichtig, dass neben einer spezifischen antidementiven Therapie zunächst die leitliniengerechte Therapie der Grunderkrankung im Vordergrund steht. Häufig kann so ein Progress der kognitiven Defizite verzögert oder verhindert werden.",

      "title": "Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anesthesia, which constitutes a state in which noxious events such as surgical procedures are imperceptible, may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. A complete or general anesthetic given by the inhalation or intravenous routes produces hypnosis (profound sleep), analgesia, muscle relaxation, and protection against the increase in blood pressure and heart rate resulting from surgical stress (maintains homeostasis). An anesthetic which blocks the neural transmission of painful stimuli through afferent nerves and does not affect the level of consciousness can be classified as a local anesthetic. Induction of general anesthesia produces a progressive deepening of the anesthetic state and represents a descending desensitization of the central nervous system (CNS). A progression of clinical signs useful for estimating the depth of anesthesia. Four stages can be defined: first, a state of altered consciousness and analgesia begin; second, loss of consciousness, accompanied by irregular respiration and motor movement from depression of higher motor inhibitory centers with release of lower motor mechanisms, occurs; third, surgical anesthesia is reached, in which spinal cord and spinal reflexes are abolished, providing relaxation of skeletal musculature, and loss of corneal, conjunctival, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes occurs progressively; fourth, onset of respiratory paralysis resulting from significant depression of the medullary respiratory center occurs, and subsequent cardiovascular collapse ensues. Monitoring via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring help assess the depth of anesthesia. The potency of inhaled agents is expressed as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that is required to prevent spontaneous movement in response to a surgical or equivalent stimulus in 50% of patients. The onset of action is fast (within 60 s) for the intravenous anesthetic agents and somewhat slower for inhalation and local anesthetics. Although the modern practice of anesthesia is exceedingly sophisticated, identification of the basic molecular mechanism underlying it is still lacking. Inhalational anesthetics are very diverse chemically and extrapolation from the effect of a particular agent to the physiological state of anesthesia is problematic. Anesthesia theories may be divided into two categories: lipid theories and protein theories. Lipid theory postulates that inhalational anesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in the lipid portions of nerves, altering the conductivity. In protein theories, the direct interaction of inhalation anesthetics and proteins has been proposed as the cause of anesthesia. All inhalation anesthetics agents introduced after 1950, except ethyl vinyl ether, contain fluorine. Agents such as ether, chloroform, trichloroethylene (Trilene), cyclopropane, and fluoroxene (Fluoromar), which were once used, have been displaced by the newer fluorinated anesthetics. The intravenous (iv) anesthetic agents are of two types: those which are used to induce, but not maintain, anesthesia, and those useful for induction and also maintenance. The need is for an anesthetic agent having an extremely fast rate of onset and limited side effects. Fast onset minimizes the stress and agitation. Among the various classes of compounds that have been used are barbiturates, opioids, steroids, benzodiazepines, and hindered phenols. Balanced anesthesia, a potent opioid combined with an inhalation agent, is often used. The inhalational agents probably exert their biological activity through physical effects, while function through a biological receptor‐mediated pathway. At the end of a surgery, the primary concern is to eliminate respiratory depressant effects. This reversal can also diminish analgesic effects. There are two types of reversal agents: pure antagonists and mixed agonist–antagonists. The antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are the most commonly used. Local anesthetics act by inhibiting the channel opening allowing influx of sodium ions. The degree of blockage depends not only on the amount of drug, but also on the rate of nerve stimulation. In the clinically useful agents the polar group is an ester or an amide, although activity may be maintained when the polar function is an ether, thioether, ketone, or thioester. The ideal agent should have a short onset of nesthesia and be useful for multiple indications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Injury to the peripheral nerve affects the whole length of the neuron and is not just localized to the site of injury, making a nerve injury different from other types of tissue injury in the body. Moreover, a nerve injury has immediate functional consequences for the brain in terms of rapid cortical functional reorganization. Lifelong limitations of hand function with loss of sensibility, muscle weakness, prehensile problems, pain, and cold sensitivity are common. Recovery can take years in adults, especially of tactile discrimination, but often remains incomplete and quality of life may be significantly affected. Numerous factors influence the outcome: age, type of injury, timing of surgery, and cognitive capacity. In addition, education, sex, and post-traumatic stress have proved to be prognostic factors. The timing of hand rehabilitation including sensory and motor re-education are also important contributors to the final outcome.",

      "abstract": "Vertigo, dizziness, and disequilibrium are common symptoms following concussion or traumatic brain injury. Dizziness and vertigo may be the result of trauma to the peripheral vestibular system or the central nervous system, or, in some cases, may be due to anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder; these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. While most peripheral vestibular disorders can be identified by testing and examination, those without inner ear causes that have persisting complaints of dizziness and motion sickness are more difficult to understand and to manage. Some of these patients exhibit features compatible with vestibular migraine and may be treated successfully with migraine preventative medications. This paper reviews the neurological causes of persisting dizziness, the possible mechanisms, and the pathophysiology, as a framework for patient management and for future research.

Many patients are found in bed or in the bedroom at the time of their death. Autonomic nervous system responses leading to fatal arrhythmias during changes in the sleep-wake cycle have been described in nonepileptic patients. Increased sympathetic tone alone can cause microscopic ischemic cardiac lesions or neurogenic pulmonary edema that may lead to death. In epilepsy, both partial and generalized seizures are associated with changes in autonomic function. These seizures are frequently more common in sleep. Finally, the younger population, who tends to be less compliant, has a higher rate of death.",

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblastosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

These processes include a wide range of space-occupying lesions such as tumor, hematoma, and abscess. (2) Destructive lesions cause coma by direct damage to the ascending arousal system or its forebrain targets. To cause coma, lesions of the diencephalon or brainstem must be bilateral, but can be quite focal if they damage the ascending activating system near the midline in the midbrain or caudal diencephalon; cortical or subcortical damage must be both bilateral and diffuse. Processes that may cause these changes include tumor, hemorrhage, infarct, trauma, or infection. Both destructive and compressive lesions may cause additional compression by producing brain edema.",

They are relatively common in diseases of disturbed vigilance, like narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, and sleep apnea. These patients often suffer from attacks of hypovigilance, characterized by altered awareness, automatic behaviour and partial or complete amnesia for the attack. Because of the memory 'black outs' and the frequently associated hypnagogic hallucinations, the patients behave inappropriately and often appear confused. Confusional states also typically arise during basilar artery migraine attacks. This special form of complicated migraine predominantly affects young females and is characterized by symptoms and signs of brain stem dysfunction such as vertigo, ataxia, paresthesia, limb weakness, dysarthria; in 75% of the cases, disorders of consciousness dominate. Transient ischemic attacks are sometimes recurrent and, when involving the cranial basilar territory, may result in confusional states without significant motor dysfunction. Attacks of transient global amnesia are possibly also ischemic in nature and are assumed to arise from transient bilateral limbic failure. Affecting only memory functions, they are strictly spoken not confusional, but must nevertheless be taken into consideration when proper observation during the attack was not possible.",

      "abstract": "Resumo : O AVE ou Acidente Vascular Encefalico e uma doenca que acomete as pessoas adultas e idosas e que causa disfuncao motora (sob forma de comprometimento no hemicorpo: hemiparesia que e uma fraqueza muscular ou hemiplegia que e a paralisia dos musculos do lado comprometido), disfuncao na comunicacao (sob forma de afasia), na cognicao (problemas na memoria) na incapacidade de realizacao de tarefas cotidianas e no desempenho funcional/ocupacional das pessoas acometidas pela patologia. Uma disfuncao invisivel e que passa despercebida para o paciente e, por vezes, para os profissionais que o acompanham, e a perda da sensibilidade. A referida perda tem consequencias no desempenho motor pois sem o feed-back sensorial torna-se dificil realizar movimentos delicados ou coordenados. E a disfuncao sensorial pode agravar os problemas de negligencia do lado afetado, uma vez que o paciente nao sente o lado acometido, “abandonando” o uso da mao comprometida. Uma das grandes dificuldades da familia e cuidadores e com relacao as disfuncoes apresentadas pelo paciente e como realizar as atividades para que o mesmo alcance independencia nas tarefas cotidianas. As orientacoes dadas pela Terapia Ocupacional no momento da alta hospitalar quanto as atividades da vida diaria, para recuperacao sensorial e adequacao das atividades em geral, sao bem recebidas pelos familiares. Um acompanhamento sistematico, com novas orientacoes e demonstracoes e de grande valia para reduzir as dificuldades para desempenho das atividades da vida diaria por parte dos pacientes e para minimizar as demandas junto aos cuidadores. Os beneficiarios diretos sao os familiares e mais especificamente os cuidadores dos pacientes que, em geral, sao as esposas/companheiras dos pacientes que ja tem tarefas de cuidados domesticos. Foram beneficiados aproximadamente 30 pessoas e a reducao das demandas por parte dos pacientes foi crucial para qualidade de vida.",

These impairments can have a functional origin, but more commonly they result from neurological injury or disease. Functional amnesia is a psychiatric disorder. The amnesia in this case is presumed to result from conflict and repression, and its presentation varies from individual to individual. Typically, a patient is admitted to the hospital in a confused or frightened state. Memory for the past has been lost, especially personal, autobiographical memory. Often, the patient cannot produce his or her own name. Yet, the ability to learn new material is almost always intact. After the disorder clears, usually within a week, the lost memories return except for the events of the day or two just prior to hospital admission. Rarely, the disorder lasts longer, and sizable pieces of the past remain unavailable.",

A blunt injury with no penetration of the skull is considered a closed head injury. Due to the nature of the mechanical forces involved in a closed head injury, the associated pattern of cognitive deficits is distinct from that observed in penetrating head injuries. Closed head injuries generally result in pervasive and diffuse deficits in addition to any focal impairment. In contrast, penetrating injuries (e.g., from a gunshot wound) may or may not lead to alteration or impairment of consciousness, depending on the severity and the location of the trauma. In this chapter, we will primarily discuss the impact of closed head injuries, as these are both more prevalent and more likely to affect memory.",

Acquired neuropathies are primary or secondary to other conditions. These are demyelinating, axonal or mixed. Focal damage occurs typically because of compression, either as a nerve passes through a tissue tunnel or against a bone, for example the common peroneal nerve against the fibula. Anterior horn cell diseases are either sporadic, for example the typical common Motor Neurone Disease (MND), or hereditary – Spinal Muscular Atrophies. MND is a common degenerative disease of the neurones within the corticospinal tracts, brainstem and anterior horn cells that leads to disability and death. The principal function of the muscle cell is to respond to a motor neurone action potential by contracting, thus transforming electrical and chemical energy into a graded mechanical response – and then relaxing. Rhabdomyolysis means breakdown of striated muscle and results from muscle injury.",

Many of these are nonconvulsive and have been increasingly recognized with the advent of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. When seizures are prolonged or recur without a return to baseline, this is termed status epilepticus (SE)—a true medical emergency. Progression to refractory SE may occur quickly after onset, with a high potential for subsequent permanent neuronal damage. Successful management of SE therefore rests with early recognition and treatment, with a low threshold to begin anesthetic agents if seizures remain refractory to initial therapy. Meanwhile, a concurrent focus should be placed on airway, breathing, and circulation, as well as identifying the etiology of the seizures. Etiology is likely the best determinant of outcomes after SE (with outcomes worst for anoxic brain injury, followed by other newly acquired brain injury), while prolonged and refractory SE also portend a poorer prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Motor neglect is characterized by underutilization of one side of the body when this failure cannot be attributed to primary sensory and motor defects. Impaired motor activity manifests itself in disturbance of using spontaneously contralesional limbs in the absence of severe hemiplegia (motor neglect) or in reduced readiness to initiate and carry out intact ipsilesional arm movements within or towards the contralesional hemispace (pre-motor neglect). These specific higher-order motor deficits may occur in isolation (pure motor neglect) or as part of a more pervasive neglect syndrome involving disturbances in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities or even in mental images. The lesions underlying the motor variant of hemi-neglect are ascribed to various topographic sites of the brain involving cortical and subcortical structures of the right or, rarely, the left hemisphere. Motor features of neglect are more frequent, more severe and long-lasting in right--as compared with left--brain-damaged patients. This deficit additionally makes improvement and neurorehabilitation of patients with focal brain damage difficult.",

      "abstract": "Perinatal stroke is a focal vascular brain injury that occurs from the fetal period to 28 days of postnatal age. With an overall incidence of up to 1 in 1,000 live births, the most focused lifetime risk for stroke occurs near birth. Perinatal stroke can be classified by the timing of diagnosis, vessel involvement, and type of injury. Timing of diagnosis may be in the acute neonatal period or retrospectively after a period of normal development, followed by abnormal neurologic findings, with the injury presumed to have occurred around the time of birth. Strokes may be arterial or venous, ischemic, and/or hemorrhagic. Within these classifications, 6 perinatal stroke diseases are recognizable, based on clinical and radiographic features. Morbidity is high in perinatal stroke, because it accounts for most cases of hemiparetic cerebral palsy, with disability lasting a lifetime. Additional complications include disorders of sensation and vision, language delays, cognitive and learning deficits, epilepsy, and mental health consequences that affect the entire family. Advances in neonatal neurocritical care may afford opportunity to minimize brain injury and improve outcomes. In the chronic timeframe, progress made in neuroimaging and brain mapping is revealing the developmental plasticity that occurs, informing new avenues for neurorehabilitation. This review will summarize the diagnosis and management of each perinatal stroke disease, highlighting their similarities and distinctions and emphasizing a patient- and family-centered approach to management.",

How can other clinical conditions and mental states, besides brain damage, influence memory? Different subtypes of amnesia have different characteristics. The study of amnesia is important as a way of discriminating between memory processes and in linking deficits in remembering with specific neurological structures that are damaged. Not all memory disorders arise from organic injury or illness. ‘Psychogenic amnesia’ is usually caused by a functional impairment of memory with no tangible evidence of neurological brain injury.",

There are some relatively frequent patterns of involvement; e. g. facial and other cranial nerve palsies in the uveo-parotid syndrome, and within the central nervous system, granulomatous infiltration of the meninges at the base of the brain and in the adjacent hypothalamus causing neuro-endocrine and visual disturbances. But any part of the nervous system may be affected, and the great variety of possible combinations of pathological changes can give rise to bizarre clinical features.

Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS Peripheral neuropathy can be the predominant or only manifestation of certain nutrient deficiencies. Cognitive difficulties or involvement of other parts of the central nervous system, such as the optic nerve and spinal cord, may accompany nutritional peripheral neuropathies. In most patients, the nutritional deficiency may have a single predominant cause, but in some cases, multiple causes may coexist. Obesity, for unclear reasons, can be associated with nutrient deficiencies. The rising rates of bariatric surgery and the incidence of nutrient deficiencies following bariatric surgery make this a particularly relevant topic for neurologists. ESSENTIAL POINTS Neuropathies caused by nutrient deficiencies are preventable with appropriate supplementation in high-risk situations. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential to ensure an optimal outcome and minimize neurologic morbidity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Sleep disturbances are frequently identified following traumatic brain injury, affecting 30%–70% of persons, and often occur after mild head injury. Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.

      "abstract": "Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, mild traumatic brain injury and concussion are classified by transient loss of consciousness, amnesia, altered mental status, a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 to 15, and focal neurologic deficits following an acute closed head injury. Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention. Symptom-specific treatment, gradual return to activity, and multidisciplinary coordination of care lead to the best outcomes. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities, psychosocial issues, and legal or compensatory incentives should be explored in patients resistant to treatment.",

The neuropsychological disorders and neuroanatomical substrates underlying anosognosia are still poorly known. Whereas purely psychological defense mechanisms cannot account for it, no unique neuropsychological deficit in executive function, reasoning, or memory appears to be consistently linked to anosognosia. This chapter first reviews the most common forms of anosognosia for different domains of deficits and then focuses on denial of hemiplegia. Evidence from recent studies on the latter case suggests a role of multiple component deficits affecting not only motor control, attention, or proprioception but also emotional and self-monitoring systems implicated in error detection as well as belief formation and updating. These abilities are likely to rely on a distributed network of brain areas, possibly including limbic and subcortical circuits in insula, basal ganglia, and amygdala, in addition to premotor and executive control systems.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Degree of impairment was related to Glascow Coma Scale score, length of posttraumatic amnesia, reduced visuospatial and memory abilities, and the presence of intracranial pathology of the parietal lobes. Impairment was also related to trauma severity in patients without any visualized intracranial pathology, presumably due to diffuse axonal shearing.

      "title": "Benign Post-traumatic Encephalopathies in Young People",
      "abstract": "A trivial head injury can transiently render a child lethargic or even comatose. There have been several isolated reports concerning such conditions. Critical analysis disclosed that all these reports had certain factors in common: 1) they occurred in young people, 2) after head injury, 3) with several minutes to hours of lucid period; 4) neurological signs and symptoms were transient, and 5) complete recovery was usual. On closer checking, however, these syndromes could be categorized into three groups, i.e., nonconvulsive, convulsive, and brain swelling types. A typical non-convulsive type was the juvenile head trauma syndrome (Haas et al.). Injuries were usually trivial. After a short time, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, cortical blindness, hemiparesis, and/or brain stem signs occurred. Not only a similarity of the manifestations with the periodic syndrome and migraine attacks but also the presence of migraine diathesis was frequently reported. Altogether 50 cases of the convulsive type were collected from the literature. Most of them were young children with minor head injury. Some became stunned, or received skull fractures. Convulsions were mostly focal motor. The third type consisted of 23 cases of diffuse brain swelling in children with a lucid period reported by Bruce et al. Vomiting, headache, disturbed consciousness from lethargy to coma, pupillary changes, apnea, and/or convulsive seizure were noted. CT scans disclosed small ventricles and effacement of the perimesencephalic cistern. All recovered without deficits except one who died from delayed brain swelling. In the first and second types of patients, no brain swelling was documented. Two patients who, after a minor head injury, convulsed and died of severe brain swelling have been separately reported. Three cases of the first type and one case of the second type recently experienced by the authors showed normal CT scans in the acute stage. All these three types might have a common underlying mechanism and they might be collectively termed as ‘benign post-traumatic encephalopathies in young people’, modified from Guthkelch. Children and young adults must have low thresholds against external force or more specifically either to increased extracellular potassium or to cerebral vasospasm. The relationship with migraine diathesis was noted only in the first type, which probably indicates a lower threshold in such predisposed youngsters.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

Antecedentes de una situación compatible con hipoxia-isquemia perinatal: estado fetal no tranquilizador, evento centinela, y/o distocia de parto.B.

      "title": "377 Head Injury in Children",
      "abstract": "A head injury can be broadly defined as an acute traumatic insult to the head by an external force.While any part of the head can be injured in this way, the focus of this chapter is injuries to the scalp, skull, brain parenchyma, and their associated anatomic structures. Acute head injuries thus covers a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from benign contusions to intracranial hemorrhage, whichmay result in increased intracranial pressure, brainstem herniation, and death. The term traumatic brain injury (TBI) has also been used to encompass the alteration in brain function resulting from a blunt or penetrating force to the head, manifesting as confusion, altered level of consciousness, seizure, coma, or focal sensory or motor neurologic deficit. Head injuries can be classified in many different ways. Isolated injuries to the scalp, skull, and brain can and do occur. However, injuries to more than one structure are commonly encountered. As such, a system of classifying injuries solely on the basis of anatomic location lacks clinical utility. Similarly, classifying injuries on the basis of mechanism (e.g. ‘‘blunt vs. penetrating’’) fails to define head injuries in a clinically meaningful way, as each type of mechanism does not exclusively result in either an open or closed head injury. Therefore, one should not assume that a given mechanism of injury is consistently synonymous with a particular type of injury incurred. Distinguishing open from closed head injuries is another system that is commonly used. Open head injuries occur when blunt or penetrating trauma transgress the scalp and skull, exposing the brain to the external environment. By definition, all open head injuries require emergent neurosurgical consultation. With closed head injuries, on the other hand, the traumatic sequelae or the condition of the intracranial contents may not be readily apparent. Care of these patients will depend on their clinical condition and may also depend on the results of diagnostic imaging. In summary, no single classification system captures all the relevant clinical information of head injuries. The most clinically useful method of categorizing head injuries incorporates elements of all these systems, and includes an assessment of clinical neurologic status (e.g. GlasgowComaScale).",

      "abstract": "Memory is a reconstructive process classified as explicit and implicit memory by level of awareness. Explicit memory is a conscious recollection of either episodic or semantic memory. Episodic memory is from personal experience and is context-specific while semantic memory refers to general knowledge. Implicit memory is from priming, procedure memory or skills. On-line message held by the brain is the working memory. Prospective memory is about something to be done in the future. Over-reliance on gist memory brings in false memory. The stirring of emotion has effect on encoding and consolidation. Explicit memory depends on medial temporal and prefrontal lobes. Priming impinges directly on cerebral cortex. Procedure memory or motor skills are closely related to basal ganglia. Cerebellum plays an important role in classical conditioning and complex motor learning. Age effect on memory is mainly from decreased speed and capacity of the central executive function. Age-associated memory impairment could be normal aging while mild cognitive impairment could be preclinical dementia. Alzheimer's disease starts with episodic memory, frontotemporal dementia defects semantic memory and Lewy's body dementia impairs working memory.",

Cognitive symptoms are frequently experienced after concussion and include changes in concentration, memory, executive functioning, and processing speed. For many people, difficulty with thinking is clearly noticeable right away but may improve quickly. For others, difficulty with thinking persists for a longer period and can become quite frustrating and anxiety-provoking. This chapter describes some of the most common cognitive symptoms after concussion and offers some tips for how to manage these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Brain function relies on efficient coordinated neuronal network activity.Neuronal cross talk and cerebral connectivity is fragile and occurs within tight metabolic and biochemical ranges.Breakdown in brain network dynamics by stressors that hamper cerebral metabolism or neuron neurophysiology led to \"Acute Brain Failure\" syndromes (ABF) [1].ABF, under stressful event, is more likely to happen in individuals with baseline low brain resilience due to previous insults such as pre-existing neurodegenerative disorders, stroke or systemic comorbid conditions, similarly to acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure [2].According to the context, ABF may manifest clinically as Altered Mental State (AMS), delirium or worsening of, already impaired, neurological function.Although such model sets a good framework for the understanding of ABF, it does not provide pathophysiological mechanisms and therefore often confines the therapeutic interventions to symptomatic treatment.Precipitating factors of ABF such as electrolytic imbalances, hypo-glycemia, drug withdrawal, infection… are also known precipitating factors of epileptic activity and could represent one of the missing links between acute brain stressful events and ABF [3].The aim of our studies was to assess the role of Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IED), Periodic Discharges (PDs) and Non-Convulsive Seizures (NCSz) in relationship to ABF in several different acute brain insults.Indeed, IED are generally thought to be asymptomatic but dedicated studies showed alterations of cognitive functions related to IED in both children [4][5][6] and adults [7,8] as well as brain network functional connectivity impairments [9][10][11][12].Similarly, manifestations of PDs and NCSz range from subtle cognitive disturbances, with abnormal behaviour, mood changes, and higher function impairment to clouding of consciousness and unresponsiveness [13][14][15].Epileptic activities, even IED [16][17][18], also increase brain metabolic rate, a phenomenon that can lead to a \"metabolic crisis\" and ABF in situations where the brain metabolism is already fragilized by acute stressors [19][20].Our hypothesis was, thus, that IED, PDs and/or NCSz triggered by acute medical conditions could participate in ABF onset and perpetuation.We first focused on (i) broad-spectrum antibiotherapy in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), then on (ii) delirium on older individuals and finally on (iii) Early Neurological Degradation (END) after ischemic stroke.",

Encephalopathy that occurs in the patients with acute hepatic insufficiency or in the terrain of cirrhosis Is defined as acute hepatic encephalopathy. Degree of alteration in mental functions is highly variable. Minor deficits could be measured and detected by sophisticated psychometric or electroencephalometric tests (subclinical encephalopathy). As well as in other organic psychosyndromes hallucinations and confabulations can be present in the same time deficits of attention, emotions, psychomotor behavior, memory, or inversion of sleep wake cycle, which can lead to hepatic coma. In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy behavior disturbances are usually present, therefore are treated with tranquillizers, especially benzodiazepine anxiolitycs which could precipitate cerebral dysfunction. It is of importance to stress that patients with hepatic encephalopathy are highly susceptible to exogenous and endogenous benzodiazepines, which Is one of the factors of disability of neurotransmission balance. Therefore use of benzodiazepines with long half life in plasma and active metabolites, is contraindicated in the patients with, liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, because of the possibility of progression toward hepatic coma. On the basis of gabaergic hypothesis of pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine antagonists could be useful in the treatment. Flumazenil which posses high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and is used for that purpose. Severe behavioral disturbances and delirium induced by hepatic encepahlopathy have been successfully treated by our clinical experience with chlormethiazole.",

Therefore, this review focuses on the neuroprotection provided by hypothermia and a number of other neuroprotective techniques, when administered singly or in combination, because it is generally found that combinations of applications lead to significantly better neuroprotection than is achieved by any one alone. The combinatorial approach to neuroprotection holds great promise for enhancing the degree of neuroprotection following trauma, leading to maximum maintenance of neurological function.",

The results of this objective examination can provide useful information about a patient showing any degree of weakness from damage to elements of the motor unit. Sometimes abnormal sensations, such as pain, numbness, or paresthesia, obscure the underlying motor involvement; in these cases, electromyographic studies may clarify the problem. <h3>Indications</h3> Electromyography assists in differentiating lower motor-neuron disease from primary muscle disease; it also facilitates differentiation of any one type of lower motor-neuron disease or any one myopathy from others in the same disease category. The technique is particularly helpful in localizing lower motor-neuron lesions to the distribution of a peripheral nerve, a portion of a peripheral nerve, a plexus in whole or in part, a motor nerve root, or generalized involvement. In many instances the processes of peripheral-nerve degeneration and regeneration can be monitored electromyographically",

      "abstract": ": Discovery of evidence of acute brain ischemia or hypoxia and its differentiation from agonal hypoxia represents a task of interest but extremely difficult in forensic neuropathology. Generally, more than 50% of forensic autopsies indicate evidence of brain induced functional arrest of the organ system, which can be the result of a hypoxic/ischemic brain event. Even if the brain is the target organ of hypoxic/ischemic damage, at present, there are no specific neuropathological (macroscopic and histological) findings of hypoxic damage (such as in drowning, hanging, intoxication with carbon monoxide) or acute ischemia. In fact, the first histological signs appear after at least 4 to 6 hours. Numerous authors have pointed out how an immunohistochemical analysis could help diagnose acute cerebral hypoxia/ischemia.Data sources: This review was based on articles published in PubMed and Scopus databases in the past 25 years, with the following keywords \"immunohistochemical markers,\" \"acute cerebral ischemia,\" \"ischemic or hypoxic brain damage,\" and \"acute cerebral hypoxia\".: Original articles and reviews on this topic were selected. The purpose of this review is to analyze and summarize the markers studied so far and to consider the limits of immunohistochemistry that exist to date in this specific field of forensic pathology.: We identified 13 markers that had been examined (in previous studies) for this purpose. In our opinion, it is difficult to identify reliable and confirmed biomarkers from multiple studies in order to support a postmortem diagnosis of acute cerebral hypoxia/ischemia. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) is the most researched marker in the literature and the results obtained have proven to be quite useful.Immunohistochemistry has provided interesting and promising results, but further studies are needed in order to confirm and apply them in standard forensic practice.",

The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

Collectively, abnormality in the profile of these two groups of reflexes provides indications of neurological dysfunction or neurological immaturity. Spinal reflexes function at the base of the hierarchical control system. A weak or absent Moro reflex is seen in cases of upper motor neuron lesions; an asymmetrical Moro reflex at birth may indicate a fractured clavicle or an Erb's palsy. The fear paralysis reflex is a highly alert but immobile state involving one or several following physical changes.",

      "title": "[Aging of memory mechanisms].",
      "abstract": "Human amnesia cases (after surgical removal of the hippocampi or brain anoxia) have clearly established the critical role of the hippocampal formation in anterograde amnesia. Other parts of the brain may also contribute to anterograde amnesia (mammillary bodies, medial thalamus). In neurodegenerative diseases (and specially in Alzheimer's disease) amnesia is often the prominent symptom, but the brain lesions are not restricted to the hippocampal formation. In Alzheimer's disease they involve also the cerebral cortex and several subcortical nuclei. Physiological brain aging is also associated with some degree of memory impairment, but much less severe than in Alzheimer's disease. The issue of the nature and the mechanisms of the memory impairment associated with age and with Alzheimer's disease is very important, because the frequency of these problems increases dramatically as the populations of the world is growing older. There is some evidence that neuronal loss and alterations in neurotransmitter systems occur in the aged subject, but the relationship between such changes and the age-related memory deficit is far from being clear. In Alzheimer's disease, the loss of memory is likely to be due to neuronal loss in cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, along with alterations in neurotransmitter systems (specially cholinergic, monoaminergic and aminoacidergic systems). The work in experimental animals has largely confirmed the critical role of the hippocampal formation, as well as identified other critical structures. The mechanisms of the age-related memory impairment can be to some extent investigated in aged animals. In the aged rat there is evidence that several neurotransmitter networks are altered. Alteration in the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems have been extensively studied, but the involvement of other systems is likely. Learning and memory deficits are consistently observed in a sub-population of aged rodents (as well as in other species including non-human primates). For instance some aged rats do have a deficit in the performance of a spatial learning task such as the \"water maze\". There is some evidence that this deficit is due, at least in part, to alterations in the functions of the hippocampal formation. In other words, if aged rats have a spatial memory deficit, it might be due to changes in hippocampal neuronal circuitry. The study of age-related alterations in hippocampal neuronal networks, using electrophysiological techniques have shown that several neuronal properties such as resting membrane potential, membrane resistance or sodium spike amplitude are not altered in the aged rat hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

Bipolar disorder is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania or hypomania and depressive episodes; rapid cycling, mixed states, and psychotic symptoms occur in some cases. Depression is a serious mental disorder that manifests with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Mania is the opposite of depression; it is a state of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, arousal, and/or energy levels. Depression and mania are thought to be heterogeneous illnesses that can result from dysfunction of several neurotransmitter or metabolic systems.",

It is a form of diffuse cerebral dysfunction with varying severities. The acute form of encephalopathy can range from mild confusion and delirium to coma. In the more chronic, slowly progressive, or static conditions of encephalopathy, there may be retention of the attention initially with loss of cognitive capacity.Electroencephalography (EEG) is useful in evaluating patients with acute and chronic encephalopathies. The primary role is in differentiating the conditions associated with seizures. The various patterns detected with an EEG in encephalopathies are sensitive but usually not specific to a particular etiology. It is typically associated with a slowing of the cerebral activity and diffuse slow waveforms in the background. This could be secondary to the involvement of both the cortical neurons or the subcortical white matter dysfunction. Overall, EEG is useful for assessing the degree of cerebral dysfunction in encephalopathy and monitoring the changes along with clinical progression.",

      "abstract": "1. If mild cerebral trauma such as we were investigating produced changes in the electroencephalographic tracing the abnormality disappeared within a period of minutes in the vast majority of cases. 2. Patients who gave a history of amnesia following cerebral trauma, but were clear mentally at the time the EEG was taken, showed only a slight increase in the percentage of abnormal records as compared to the control series. This was true even when the records were taken within a few hours of the accident. 3. If there was an impairment of consciousness of any degree at the time the EEG was taken, abnormality in the EEG was the rule. 4. Electroencephalographic records taken within 30 minutes after patients sustained head injury showed a greater percentage of abnormality than those taken after 30 minutes had elapsed. The rapid disappearance of abnormal electroencephalographic findings points, in our opinion, to some mechanism in concussion other than petechial hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, embolic phenomenon, or any other histopathological change which must of necessity require several days to disappear. 5. In the patients with abnormal electroencephalographic records the average velocity of the striking object or of the falling head at the time of impact was greater than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals as determined by others. The average velocity of the striking object or falling head in patients who showed normal or borderline electroencephalographic records was less than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals. 6. The study of the electroencephalographic records taken immediately following mild head injury was less reliable than clinical judgment in predicting time loss from work. An ultimate opinion of the value of EEGs in this respect will depend upon a study of a group of more severely injured patients.",

      "title": "[Cranial trauma and multiple trauma: from the street to the operating room].",
      "abstract": "Brain injury occurs with a range of severity: even less severe cases should be carefully observed since they may deteriorate. By definition severe head injury has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less; comatose patients are defined as cases who do not obey commands, do not open their eyes and do not speak. Very often (50% of case in our series) brain injury is associated with relevant extracranial injuries that may add to the severity of cases and may worsen outcome. The conceptual framework for treating head injury is based on the evidence that after the impact, the initial damage may be exacerbated by insults capable of further disturbing cerebral metabolism, leading to a final damage defined as secondary damage. Secondary damage represents the final end of many pathways that can be studied at the biochemical level and are centered in a calcium influx into the neuronal cell. Most probably there is a genetic susceptibility to secondary damage leading to a range of cellular dysfunctions for any given level of insult. The management of traumatic brain injury is aimed at interrupting the chain of events leading to secondary brain damage and from this perspective the fact that damage may develop over time can be seen as a window of opportunity for timely treatment. The milestone of treatment is the removal of surgical masses. This surgical treatment can be performed only in a brain that is properly perfused and once coagulation is preserved. Therefore the organization of treatment from rescue to neuro-traumatological centers should provide appropriate restoration of the volume and a normal oxygen delivery to the brain and to the overall organism.",

Peripheral nerve compression may occur where the nerve passes through a tunnel and slides back and forth with joint flexion and extension.

Neurotransmitter receptors on postsynaptic cells change to match the identity of the newly expressed neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitter switching often appears to change the sign of the synapse from excitatory to inhibitory or from inhibitory to excitatory. In these cases, neurotransmitter switching and receptor matching thus change the polarity of the circuit in which they take place. Neurotransmitter switching produces up or down reversals of behavior. It is also observed in response to disease. These findings raise the possibility that neurotransmitter switching contributes to depression, schizophrenia, and other illnesses.

Some peripheral nerves are wrapped in a myelin sheath generated by Schwann cells, whereas others are unmyelinated. Peripheral nerves serve different motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The term peripheral neuropathy is usually used to describe symmetric and universal damage to adjacent nerves. The damage and clinical manifestations are usually located distally with a proximal progression. Several disorders can damage peripheral nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy; it is important to differentiate actual neuropathy from other disorders that can have a similar clinical presentation [1]. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy necessitates a thorough workup of possible etiologies to identify immune-mediated causes that are amenable to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Importantly, patients may occasionally suffer from more than one disease-causing their peripheral neuropathy. Clinically relevant co-comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, chronic alcohol abuse, etc. need to be considered. Evidence-based guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy have been published for specific neuropathic phenotypes such as distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, or inflammatory neuropathies. However, they are only applicable for specific neuropathic conditions or when a specific diagnosis is already suspected on clinical grounds. By focusing on the initial steps of the diagnostic workup, this standard operating procedure provides a practical guideline including clinical and additional diagnostic parameters that help to identify the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy [2].",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic cerebrasthenia and post-traumatic encephalopathy are the effects of a head trauma. Most physicians overuse these diagnoses. They do not perform differential diagnostic management, what leads to issuing erroneous opinions. The aim of this report is to show the symptoms of posttraumatic cerebrasthenia and posttraumatic encephalopathy and diagnostic investigations, which could be helpful for diagnosing these conditions. Cerebrasthenia (the subjective posttraumatic syndrome, subjective syndrome, posttraumatic neurosis) is usually a functional--unorganic disorder. It happens in the cases of many people who had brain concussion. The most common symptoms are: headache, vertigo, irritability, insomnia, attention deficits, fatigability. Posttraumatic encephalopathy is a persistent brain tissues injury which could be caused by more severe trauma (brain contusion, endocranial bleeding). The clinical picture of this disease entity is not unambiguous. The most frequently encountered form is a simple (common) form, which is similar to cerebrasthenia, but with differences in the neurological examination (focal signs) and with persistent changes in EEG.",

REM sleep is often called dreaming (or D) sleep, because dreams are reported by about 70–80% of persons awakened during this period. REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

This chapter introduces patterns that are more specific to the post cardiac arrest setting that are associated with a poor prognosis. It argues that none of these are absolute and a discussion of prognosis must be integrated with the remainder of the clinical features, and other electrophysiologic information, including somatosensory evoked potentials. Myoclonic status epilepticus is the syndrome whereby there is continuous or near continuous myoclonus after cardiac arrest. Prognostication after cardiac arrest is a complex integration of clinical history, patient examination, neuroimaging and neurophysiologic measures. A pattern with a great degree of emerging dichotomy is burst suppression. Non-identical bursts are more physiologic, with the content of bursts varying between each other. The presence of identical bursts in the post cardiac arrest setting may have a nearly universal poor outcome, though there are limited data on this to date.",

In the perinatal period a transient perfusion failure can result in localized brain damage in the cortex, white matter or more rarely basal ganglia. Before birth lesions occuring in the last trimester of pregnancy do not significantly differ from those occuring at birth, and their origin is also circulatory. During the first semester, a particular type of post migratory malformation also due to perfusion failure, microgyria, may remain localized to one cortical segment.

The problems of microcephaly without evident brain destruction, and the possible absence of all cerebral morphological alteration in certain mental defective are discussed.",

In ideal circumstances, this can be diagnosed in a clinical sensory examination as a decrease or total loss of sensation of one or several sensory modalities within the affected nerve distribution. While the negative symptoms and signs of hypoesthesia are essential for the diagnosis of a neuropathy, some patients also develop one or more positive sensory signs including pain, allodynia, paraesthesia, and hyperesthesia. Within the trigeminal distribution, these positive phenomena may severely interfere with vital and socially important functions, e.g. mimics, eating, speaking, teeth brushing, and kissing. The sensory hypoesthesia caused by sensory nerve fibre damage may be so subtle, however, that it cannot be detected in the rather crude clinical sensory examination.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Ataxia, defined as impaired coordination of movement and balance, is associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum or the sensory or motor pathways connecting to it. The causes of ataxia range from a transient parainfectious process to a progressive degenerative neurologic condition. The challenge for the pediatrician is to distinguish among the possible etiologies.The evaluation of ataxia begins with a thorough history and careful neurodevelopmental examination. The history must include the onset and duration of the symptom; family history of migraine or neurologic disease; recent infection, seizure, or head injury; and possible environmental exposure to heavy metals, gases, solvents, or medications. It is important to ask about other signs and symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, photophobia,vertigo, and altered mental status.Distinguishing whether a young child has age-appropriate clumsiness or is truly ataxic requires familiarity with the developmental milestones related to coordinated movements. Ataxia also must be distinguished from other disorders of the nervous system or of the muscles. The child should be examined in an upright position with attention to mental status, balance, presence of nystagmus, deep tendon reflexes, and muscle tone and strength. Muscle weakness from a myopathy or neuropathy may present with an altered gait and unstable balance, but it should be recognized on the basis of diminished muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes. Conversely, children who have spasticity may exhibit an unsteady,narrow-based gait, but they will demonstrate increased muscle tone and brisk reflexes. Movement disorders such as chorea and myoclonus, unlike ataxia,are evident even when the child is at rest.The examiner must look for evidence of increased intracranial pressure or infection by checking for abnormal vital signs, meningismus, and papilledema. With a patient is old enough to cooperate, the neurologic examination should evaluate cranial nerve function,heel-to-knee movement, finger-to-nose movement, tandem gait, rapid alternating movement, and speech. It is particularly important to listen for dysarthria,specifically the scanning speech pattern associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Dysfunction of the cerebellar vermis presents with truncal ataxia—imbalance in the sitting position and head titubation. Dysfunction of the cerebellar hemispheres presents with a gait that veers toward the involved side and dysmetria of the ipsilateral extremity. Attenuation of sensory input because of peripheral nerve or posterior column damage leads to a careful high-stepping gait and a positive Romberg sign. Children who have sensory ataxia have problems with fine finger movements rather than dysmetria.A typical presentation of acute ataxia is the sudden onset of a wide-based gait, with swerving and unsteadiness that is recognized easily by parent and physician. The most common causes are drug ingestion and postinfectious cerebellitis. The differential diagnosis includes head trauma, vascular events, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barrésyndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia), labyrinthitis, seizure, and conversion reaction. Drugs associated with ataxia include phenytoin,carbamazepine, sedatives, hypnotics, and phencyclidine. Intoxication with alcohol, ethylene glycol, hydrocarbon fumes,lead, mercury, or thallium also may present with ataxia. A variety of pathogens can cause postinfectious cerebellitis, but it is observed most frequently after varicella.The evaluation of the child who has acute ataxia is based on the history and findings on physical examination, but it also should include a complete blood count, measurement of electrolytes,toxicologic screening of blood and urine, brain imaging, and lumbar puncture. If magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography demonstrates a mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or other intracranial abnormality, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation may be deferred. The presence of cells in the CSF may indicate infection, and elevated CSF protein levels are seen with Guillain-Barrésyndrome and multiple sclerosis. Ataxia, especially if accompanied by opsoclonus or myoclonus (“dancing eyes, dancing feet”), can be associated with neuroblastoma. If this diagnosis is suspected, examination of urine for vanillylmandelic acid/homovanillac acid(VMA/HVA) and imaging of the chest and abdomen are recommended.If the initial evaluation fails to establish a diagnosis, what appears to be acute ataxia actually may be the initial presentation of a more chronic process. Basilar migraine, seizure, and some rare metabolic disorders (Hartnup disease,maple syrup urine disease, pyruvate decarboxylase deficiency) may manifest with acute intermittent episodes of ataxia. Evaluation again is based on the history, but it may include brain imaging, electroencephalography, and electromyography. If metabolic disease is suspected, evaluation of amino acids,acid/base balance, lactate, pyruvate,ammonia, and ketones may be helpful.The slow evolution of ataxia in a previously healthy child warrants rapid evaluation. The most common causes of progressive ataxia are brain tumors(medulloblastoma, cerebellar astrocytoma,brain stem glioma, ependymoma)and degenerative spinocerebellar diseases, some of which present in infancy and others of which are delayed in onset until adulthood. Friedreich ataxia,an autosomal recessive disorder linked to a defect on chromosome 9, presents in the first decade of life with ataxia,pes cavus, scoliosis, and areflexia. Ataxia telangiectasia, also autosomal recessive, is marked by an abnormality on the long arm of chromosome 11 and is characterized by progressive truncal ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias,and recurrent infections of the sinuses and lungs. If magnetic resonance imaging of a child who has progressive ataxia fails to disclose an intracranial mass, referral for a detailed metabolic and genetic evaluation is warranted.In summary, ataxia may represent a benign, transient condition or a progressive, devastating neurologic disorder. As is usually true, a careful history and physical examination, followed by a focused radiologic and laboratory assessment, most often will lead to the proper diagnosis and intervention.As a disorder of coordination that depends on sensory,proprioceptive, motor, and integrative neural activities, ataxia can reflect dysfunction at virtually any level of the nervous system, not just the cerebellum. It also can be difficult to distinguish between ataxia and weakness when a child presents with, for example, an abnormal gait, and the differential diagnosis,although related, is not the same. Ataxia is particularly frightening because it represents a loss of physical control for the patient, and it poses some very nasty possibilities for the pediatrician. Clinical medicine is not easy, but it is less difficult if we go back to the basics,with a careful history and physical examination. It’s amazing how often we can get to the answer without magnetic resonance imaging.",

      "abstract": "Syphilitic Ceremal Tuwuvor.-Among the most interesting examples of syphilitic disease of the brain, are those in which the morbid deposit takes the form of a distinct tumour.The symptoms common to nearly all cerebral tumours, when any symptoms at all are present, are, severe pain in the head, vomiting, and double optic neuritis, the pain being fixed in seat or radiating from one point, but variable in intensity at different times.Cases, however, are on record in which tumours have attained a large size without giving rise to abnormal phenomena of any kind; and, although the concurrence, for any long time, of the three symptoms men- tioned would be almost conclusive of the existence of tumour, the absence of one or other would not necessarily be conclusive to the con- trary.Superadded to these general symptoms may be hemiplegia, motor or sensory, if the central ganglia be involved, or paralysis of indi- vidual nerves if' the tumour be situate at the base of the brain, or con- vulsions if the grey matter of the surface of the hemispheres be affected.The symptom of greatest importance is unquestionably the double optic neuritis; and, as Dr. HughlingsJackson, in particular, has pointed out, it may for some time be the only symptom; or, if not quite alone, it may be associated with symptoms so slight as to have no significance independently of it.We must not wait till vision begins to suffer before examining the eyes.It is with constantly renewed astonishment, notwithstanding the frequent illustrations brought forward by Dr. Jackson, and exhibited to this Society and elsewhere, and my own experience, that I see the ex- tensive changes in the disc compatible with good vision.We are as yet in uncertainty as to the immediate mode of production of optic changes, and of the chain of causation by which they are connected with tumours.It may, perhaps, be taken as certain that one way in which changes in the optic disc are produced is by increased intracranial pressure; and it appears probable, moreover, that this intracranial pressure operates through fluid being forced along the sheath of the optic nerve between its two layers, which bulges out the sheath near the eye, and compresses the nerve and its vessels.But the optic changes may be entirely absent, or having appeared may subside, when we have every reason to suppose, from examination after death, that intracranial pressure must have ex- isted; and they may be present when we can see no cause of intracranial pressure.If the existence of fluid in a position to be carried into the optic sheath be a condition required for the production of strangulation of the nerve, the absence of effusion in the membranes at the base of the brain may explain some cases in which optic changes have not appeared.But it is riot even a settled point whether there is, or is not, a distinction between ischremia of the disc, a vascular strangulation or obstruction due to intracranial pressure, and neuritis descendens, an inflammation propagated to the disc by the continuity of the neurilemma with the pia mater; or, admitting the distinction, whether the difference can be made out by ophthalmoscopic characters.Till this is decided, we can- not so much as pass the threshold of the inquiry as to the mode of pro- duction of optic changes in diseases of the brain.If I were not held back by the doubts of men such as Dr. Hughlings Jackson and Mr. Hutchinson, whose opinion in this matter I hold to be far higher than my own, I should consider my own experience warranted me in ollowing Dr. Clifford Allbutt in recognising a difference between optic isclhamia",

      "abstract": "prognosis • unresponsive wakefulness syndrome Causes of development of severe disorders of consciousnessHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain infarction are common causes of mortality and morbidity [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].Many patients affected by these acquired brain injuries (ABIs) die in the acute stages during their stay in the intensive care unit; others, after a coma phase, usually develop a severe disorder of consciousness (DoC), characterized by an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or a minimally conscious state (MCS).In some cases, consciousness level improves, transitioning to an emergence from MCS (E-MCS); however, patients with E-MCS often show a severe neurological disability [9].In recent years, improvements both in intensive care technology and in neurosurgical procedures have reduced the mortality rate; however, as a result, many patients discharged from the acute setting exhibit severe DoCs. Neurological prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousnessPredicting the neurological outcome in a patient with severe DoC is an important goal in the acute stages after ABI [10], mainly for two reasons: first, the appropriate therapeutic management among the intensive care units can be better identified, and second, a patient who needs further multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment compared with a patient who should be addressed to a long-term care after hospital discharge, can be better identified [6,7].However, establishing the neurological prognosis in postacute stages, when patients are already admitted to the intensive rehabilitation units (IRUs), is also important for individualized multidisciplinary rehabilitation planning, in view of realistic expectations of a patient's recovery and for assisting physicians in communicating with the patient's family members and caregivers.However, in contrast to the literature about the acute stages, there are no strong data about the long-term neurological prognosis in patients already admitted to the IRUs.In fact, to date, only a few studies [9,11] have analyzed postacute clinical or instrumental predictors for late neurological prognosis, showing some limitations and conflicting results.One of the main reasons for the lack of postacute robust neurological predictors has been the evaluation of only one parameter at a time in most of the recent studies.In fact, only Scarpino et al. [12] accounted for the association of postacute clinical and instrumental parameters for the neurological outcome prediction, as suggested by Kotchoubey and Pavlov [13].In particular the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised total score at patient admission in IRU and its improvement in the first 4 weeks after admission, are the only clinical variables that have been showed to be predictors of neurological outcome predictors [9].Of the instrumental parameters, electroencephalography (EEG) has been the test most commonly investigated both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.",

The lesions may occur before, during and after the birth. Some of them occur only in foetuses and infants less than two months old. The topic has been simplified in order to be useful as a basis for evaluating these lesions in daily diagnostic work. Cerebral hypoxic/ischemic injuries are frequently seen in preterm infants and term infants with severe cardiac anomalies. Extensive damage may be fatal or may involve severe permanent psychomotoric deficits in the survivors. The severity of the deficiencies depends on the type, location, and extent of damage. A severe lesion is a common cause of cerebral palsy, and a mild lesion is probably one cause of minimal brain dysfunction. Recent studies indicate that the lesions seen in preterm infants frequently occurred in utero. Thus, autopsies of perinatal deaths should include neuropathological examination of the brain to disclose possible cerebral/hypoxic damage, and its distribution, severity and age.",

Neuropsychological assessments revealed deficits on visual processing tasks. Neuroimaging, electroencephalography and ophthalmological evaluation revealed no abnormalities. The multimodal sensory distortions responded to antipsychotic treatment, paralleling improvement in other schizophrenia psychopathology, over a period of one month.Prominent and persistent multimodal sensory distortions like metamorphopsia and paracousis in the presence of psychotic symptoms warrant a detailed neurological and general medical work-up. These symptoms presenting in the absence of neurological or substance use disorders may be a component of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy is evidenced as an altered mental state with various neurological symptoms, such as memory and cognitive problems. The type of a substance-evoked encephalopathy will depend on the drug, substance, or combination being abused. The categories into which we could place the various abused substances could be tentatively divided into stimulants, amphetamines, hallucinogens, narcotics, inhalants, anesthetics, anabolic steroids, and antipsychotics/antidepressants. Other factors that may underlie encephalopathy, such as infectious agents, environmental, and other factors have also to be taken into account. Drugs of abuse can be highly toxic to the CNS following acute, but more so in chronic exposure, and can produce significant damage to other organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The damage to these organs may be at least partially reversible when drug abuse is stopped but CNS damage from repeated or prolonged abuse is often irreversible. The major pathways for the organ and CNS toxicity could be related to ischemic events as well as increased cell damage due to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in increased excitotoxicity, reduced energy production, and lowered antioxidant potential. These susceptibilities could be strengthened by the use of antioxidants to combat free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, lipoic acid); trying to improve energy generation by using mitochondriotropic/metabolic compounds (e.g., thiamine, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, riboflavin); by reducing excitotoxicity (e.g., glutamate antagonists) and other possible strategies, such as robust gene response, need to be investigated further. The drug-abuse-evoked encephalopathy still needs to be studied further to enable better preventative and protective strategies.",

There are significant short- and long-term sequelae of concussion, and early diagnosis and management are key to recovery. Visual system symptoms and signs are common following concussion and have been shown to be a useful feature of concussion testing. Neuro-ophthalmic findings include abnormalities in the pupillary light reflex, accommodation, convergence, extraocular motility, steroacuity, as well as pursuit and saccades. Concussion generally occurs out of the medical setting, and access to a trained examiner or equipment to assist in diagnosis is limited. For this reason, much research is focused on developing a concussion test that is practical and reliable, and technology is likely to play an important role in this. Ultimately, no single test is a substitute for clinical judgment and multifaceted testing.",

Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner.

Neuropathic pain has a great impact on the quality of life. Majority of the patients are unable to maintain an independent lifestyle due to their moderate to severe chronic pain and often depression contributes to the illness. Many common diseases, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis and syringomyelia may produce neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is a complex disease, involving several molecular pathways. Neuropathic pain treatment is stil extremely difficult despite our knowledge about this difficult to diagnose and treat pain condition has improved a lot with the aid of recent experimental and clinical studies. This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment approaches based on different mechanisms of effect.",

The main symptom is loss of vision (visual acuity and visual field damages), with colors appearing subtly washed out in the affected eye. The diagnosis is made on clinical examination. The history often points to the possible etiology of the optic neuropathy. In most of the cases, one eye is affected but it could be both. A rapid onset is typical of demyelinating, inflammatory, ischemic, and traumatic causes. A gradual course points to compressive, toxic/nutritional, and hereditary causes. The classic clinical signs of optic neuropathy are visual acuity and field defects, dyschromatopsia, and abnormal pupillary response. There are ancillary investigations that can support the diagnosis of optic neuropathy. Visual field testing, neuroimaging of the brain and orbit are essential in many optic neuropathies including demyelinating and compressive. In the last decade, increase of use new technology for optic neuropathies evaluation including multifocal visual evoked potentials and optic coherence tomography. Long standing of optic neuropathy is described by pale optic disk or optic atrophy, which means damage and death of these nerve cells or neurons.",

      "title": "Understanding Visual Disorders through Correlation of Clinical and Radiologic Findings",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with visual disturbances often require a neuroimaging approach. The spectrum of visual disturbances includes three main categories: vision impairment, ocular motility dysfunction, and abnormal pupillary response. Decreased vision is usually due to an eye abnormality. However, it can also be related to other disorders affecting the visual pathway, from the retina to the occipital lobe. Ocular motility dysfunction may follow disorders of the cranial nerves responsible for eye movements (ie, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves); may be due to any abnormality that directly affects the extraocular muscles, such as tumor or inflammation; or may result from any orbital disease that can alter the anatomy or function of these muscles, leading to diplopia and strabismus. Given that pupillary response depends on the normal function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, an abnormality affecting these neuronal systems manifests, respectively, as pupillary miosis or mydriasis, with other related symptoms. In some cases, neuroimaging studies must complement the clinical ophthalmologic examination to better assess the anatomic and pathologic conditions that could explain the symptoms. US has a major role in the assessment of diseases of the eye and anterior orbit. CT is usually the first-line imaging modality because of its attainability, especially in trauma settings. MRI offers further information for inflammatory and tumoral cases. ©RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging in Epileptic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, and affects about 50 million people around the world. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. There are no age, sex or race discriminations, although incidence of the first epileptic seizure has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in childhood and after 60 years of age (Engel & Pedley, 2008). According to their localization, epilepsies and epileptic seizures should be classified as focal (or partial) and generalized. Partial seizures begin in a restricted portion of cerebral cortex. Partial seizures are associated with a restricted area of the of the cerebral cortex and are clasified as either simple or complex, depending on the level of conscious awareness. Simple partial seizures are characterized by brief specific neurologic dysfunction, contingent upon the localization of the epileptogenic focus. By definition, they do not compromise consciousness during the event, and might manifest as motor signs (with a focus involving the primary motor area), sensitive symptoms (focus in the primary somatosensory area), autonomic or psychic signs (mesiobasal areas). Complex partial seizures affect the patient’s consciousness from the onset of the event. Both simple and complex partial seizures can propagate to the whole brain and become secondarily generalized seizures. Examples of primary generalized seizures are absence seizures, tonic-clonic generalized seizures, and myoclonic seizures. All those three seizure types are generated by epileptic discharges involving both cerebral hemispheres from their onset. By extension, focal epilepsies are characterized by recurrent spontaneous partial seizures, and generalized epilepsies have generalized seizures as their main seizure type. Epilepsies can be idiopathic (without an identifiable structural cause), symptomatic (due to a structural lesion), or cryptogenic (with a presumed lesion, not detectable by current available neuroimaging methods). Broadly, idiopathic epilepsies (partial or generalized) begin in the childhood years, have a good prognosis, and go into remission during adolescence. The symptomatic generalized epilepsies encompass a group of epileptic syndromes with very poor prognosis, characterized by extremely refractory seizures and accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay. The symptomatic partial epilepsies depict a large spectrum of epileptic disorders caused by several types of brain lesions. A significant percentage of patients who have seizures not responsive to antiepileptic drugs is affected by this type of epilepsy. Surgical treatment becomes a good therapeutic option for these patients, and the identification of the structural cortical lesion causing their epilepsies is primordial for a good postsurgical prognosis (Panaiyotopoulos, 2010).",

      "abstract": "One of the most common co-morbidities of cerebrovascular disorders is neuroinflammation, a hallmark and decisive contributor to many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although neuropathological conditions differ in etiology and in the way in which the inflammatory response is mounted, cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation are probably similar in aging, hypertension, depression and cognitive impairment or after cerebral insult such as stroke. Moreover, a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis are increasingly understood to act as “silent contributors” to neuroinflammation – not only establishing the condition as a central pathophysiological mechanism, but also constantly fuelling it. Mild, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and subsequent dementia. Acute neuroinflammation, often in the context of traumatic or ischemic CNS lesions, aggravates the acute damage and can lead to depression, post-stroke dementia and neurodegeneration. All of these sequelae impair recovery and provide the ground for further cerebrovascular events.",

Dans le cadre des encéphalopathies avec épilepsie une démarche diagnostique rigoureuse est nécessaire avec notamment un examen cutané (syndromes neuro‐cutanés), un examen moteur (séquelles anoxo‐ischémiques de la période périnatale), un EEG, une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) cérébrale ainsi que la recherche d'anomalies associées (cardiaque, rénale…). D'autre part il existe des encéphalopathies épileptogènes telles que les syndromes liés à l'âge : syndrome hémiconvulsions, hémiplégie, épilepsie (HHE) ; syndrome de Rasmussen, épilepsie myoclonique sévère du nourrisson (syndrome de Dravet), épilepsie myoclono‐astatique (Doose) que nous développerons comme exemples. L'âge, le type de crises et l'EEG sont utiles pour le diagnostic dans ce cas, les autres examens étant généralement peu contributifs. Retard et épilepsie sont souvent associés et la première étape du diagnostic est d'essayer de comprendre si l'épilepsie est une cause active du désordre cognitif ou non, afin d'affiner la démarche étiologique mais aussi d'adapter la prise en charge thérapeutique.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy, also called seizure disorder, is the most common childhood brain disorder in the United States. The aetiology of epilepsy in children is multifactorial with congenital, metabolic, infective, and problems associated with prematurity being common causes. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old. About 1 in 200 children (0.5%) have epilepsy, a neurological condition where children have a predisposition to recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, especially in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Epilepsy can be thought of in terms of either: the site of seizure origin in the brain (generalised or focal seizures), or the underlying cause. Genetic epilepsies (formerly called idiopathic or primary epilepsies) occur in an otherwise normal person and are due to a genetic predisposition to seizures. Some epilepsies are due to an underlying abnormality of the brain structure or chemistry (formerly called symptomatic or secondary epilepsies). Other epilepsies have no known cause. Epilepsy is commonly diagnosed in children and can be confused with other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is essential. A seizure is an excessive surge of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which parts of the brain are involved. Seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, caused by fever in a young child or severe hypoglycemia, are not considered to be forms of epilepsy. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause but can be related to genetics or brain injury. When a child has two or more unprovoked seizures, epilepsy is often the diagnosis. Despite advances in antiepileptic medication therapy, a significant number of pediatric patients with epilepsy have seizures that are not well controlled. Antiepileptic medications interact with anesthetic agents, and common anesthetics can precipitate or suppress seizure activity. There are important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly used in anaesthesia.

      "abstract": "Facial-onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by sensory loss and motor deficits, primarily affecting the face and upper extremities. The condition begins with sensory impairments in the trigeminal nerve distribution, extending to involve the scalp, neck, upper limbs, and trunk. Symptoms include facial weakness, bulbar disturbances (dysphonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and sialorrhea), and lower motor neuron signs (weakness, atrophy, fasciculation, and cramps) in the limbs. A hallmark of FOSMN is the diminished or absent corneal reflex, indicating trigeminal nerve involvement and leading to potential complications like neurotrophic keratitis (NK), which can cause corneal ulceration and blindness. The etiology of FOSMN remains uncertain, with theories proposing autoimmune or neurodegenerative origins. Diagnosis is challenging due to the overlap with other ocular surface disorders, necessitating careful examination and differential diagnosis. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, including eye protection to prevent corneal complications. Awareness and early detection of ocular symptoms in FOSMN are crucial for preventing severe outcomes like NK and blindness.",

      "title": "A Review of the Biological Mechanisms of Dexmedetomidine for Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Postoperative neurocognitive disorders are common neurological complications following surgery that are generally characterized by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders can exhibit as short-term postoperative delirium and/or long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, postoperative neurocognitive disorders may result in poor outcomes in patients, and are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Recently, there has been a heightened interest in mechanisms and clinical treatments for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Though some influencing factors and mechanisms of postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been revealed, they remain troublesome problems in clinical departments. Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant that may help improve postoperative cognitive impairment, especially the conditions of a postoperative acute event (postoperative delirium, within 1 week after operation) and delayed neurocognitive recovery (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, up to 30 days). In the recent literature, dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert positive effects on cognitive impairment in clinical and animal studies, especially for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However, not all clinical findings support this efficacy. Though some mechanisms of dexmedetomidine on postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been proposed, such as signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, this evidence is fragmentary and disputed in the literature. Therefore, this article aims to review the potential biological mechanisms underlying dexmedetomidine's effects on postoperative neurocognitive disorders, providing a reference for future studies.",

Cortical blindness follows bilateral occipital cortex damage, typically vascular. Deficits of verbal, visual and topographical memory become evident early in many dementias. Amnesias are common following a traumatic brain injury. Paramnesias are false or distorted recall – seen in acute confusional states or in dementia. Hallucinations are perceptual experiences without an external sensory stimulus – in other words, people see objects that are not there, hear voices, or believe there is a smell. Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult. Language competency depends on a discrete set of abilities: sensory decoding of the spoken message, appreciation of meaning, the capacity for repetition, and production of correctly articulated and correct speech.",

      "title": "Brain and Sepsis: Functional Impairment, Structural Damage, and Markers",
      "abstract": "Sepsis affects the brain, and the impairment of brain function resulting from sepsis is often associated with severe infectious disease. The effects of sepsis on the brain are detectable in previously healthy brains but are amplified in cases with concomitant brain injury, as after traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Previous injuries, in fact, increase brain vulnerability to the complex cascade of events summarized in the term “septic encephalopathy.” In fatal cases, various anatomical lesions have been demonstrated, such as proliferation of astrocytes and microglia in the cortex, cerebral infarcts, brain purpura, multiple small white matter hemorrhages, central pontine myelinolysis, or disseminated microabscesses (1). In survivors, on the contrary, reversible changes, such as reduction of cerebral blood flow, capillary leakage, and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), are involved (2,3). The interplay between direct effects of sepsis resulting from toxic mediators and indirect effects, such as arterial hypotension, hyperthermia, and increased intracranial pressure, contributes to the confused picture of the brain during sepsis. A marker of cerebral damage during sepsis could have considerable value, both for clarifying the mechanisms involved and for quantifying the degree of brain injury. In the study by Larsson et al. (4) in this issue of the journal, a possible mechanism is investigated and a marker proposed in a porcine model of endotoxemic shock. After endotoxin infusion, the plasma concentration of S-100B, a protein thought to be a marker of glial damage, increases. This significant increase could derive from glial or Schwann cell damage, accompanied by an opening of the BBB. The study detects an S-100B increase concurrent with the endotoxin infusion that is not replicated in the control group. A clear association between the infusion, its temporal profile, and the S-100B plasma levels is therefore demonstrated. It would be tempting to conclude that this S-100B increase indicates brain damage, suggesting glial destruction and BBB opening. If that is the case, a pathogenetic mechanism for brain damage resulting from endotoxin and the role of S-100B as a marker of brain dysfunction could be advocated. Unfortunately, the specific setting of this experiment does not provide all the information required for such a promising conclusion. S-100B has been acknowledged as a marker of brain damage; for instance, after traumatic brain injury (5). However, there are extra-cerebral potential sources of S-100B. In a recent study considering cerebral and extra-cerebral infections, one fourth of patients without cerebral infection showed an increase of serum S-100B (6). There is the possibility that this increase was a result of brain damage concurrent with extra-cerebral infections, but this was not confirmed. In trauma, S-100B is detectable in the absence of brain injury (7,8). The largest study (387 patients and healthy volunteers) concluded that serum S-100B is a marker of brain damage that correlates with injury severity, but, as major extracranial injuries also increase S-100B levels, specificity is still a problem (9). Unfortunately, data proving or excluding potential extra-cerebral sources of S-100B during sepsis are not available. In the experiment by Larsson et al., a large variability of the baseline concentration of S-100B, before endotoxin infusion, confirms that in some animals a large concentration of the marker is present with an intact brain, but all the reasoning is based on the assumption that S-100B increase reflects brain damage. That is likely, but not proven, as we do not have data measured in the cerebrospinal fluid, in the cerebral tissue, or in the cerebral veins. Another intriguing question that cannot be answered in this experiment is the relative role of BBB disruption. Assuming that S-100B tissue concentration in the brain increases as a result of endotoxin infusion, the concentration detected in the plasma depends both on this increase, which creates a gradient between tissue and intravascular concentration, and on the reflection coefficient of the interface between tissue and blood. If the BBB permeability is slightly increased, a much larger tissue concentration should be suspected for achieving the plasma concentrations detected in this study compared with a situation in which BBB freely allows the transit of proteins. The measurement of an independent marker of BBB permeability would have been extremely useful to clarify the results of this experiment. First, the degree of BBB disruption is important per se, as BBB opening, leading to vasogenic brain edema, is thought to be an important mechanism of septic encephalopathy. Moreover, if the degree of BBB opening could be measured, some estimate of the tissue concentration of S-100B could be attempted. The multifaceted properties of S-100B, which acts both as a marker of glial damage and of BBB function, require a separation of the two components. Direct measurements of brain variables, both in vivo (such as microdialysis, intracranial pressure, and sagittal sinus sampling) and postmortem, would greatly increase the amount of information obtainable from this relatively simple experimental model. “Brain and sepsis” remains a difficult and relatively unexplored topic, and contributions such as the paper by Larsson et al. (4) are welcome. The authors clearly admit the weaknesses of their work but also highlight the potential of this field of research.",

Methods: A selection of relevant original research and review articles was obtained from the author's personal archive and by searching PubMed, EMBASE and Medline using a combination of the terms cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar syndrome and normal neuroimaging or CT/MRI.Results: Cerebellar ataxia represents an important neurological presentation in the emergency and outpatient clinic settings.Causes of cerebellar ataxia with unremarkable neuroimaging are vast and include stroke, toxic, nutritional/metabolic, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, paraneoplastic, genetic and post-traumatic.Although neuroimaging forms a key part of the workup of new-onset cerebellar ataxia, sensitivity may be limited, but this is dependent on aetiology.In progressive ataxic syndromes, cerebellar atrophy is frequently a common endpoint but may not be apparent early in disease.Conclusions: New-onset cerebellar ataxia with negative or soft neuroimaging findings may still require an extensive diagnostic workup, but this must be guided by the clinical history and examination findings.",

The presence and extent of spinal cord injuries depend on how much kinetic energy is imparted to the spine, the extent of spinal column failure, the extent of neural compression, the presence of persistent neural compression or neural element transection, and the resilience of the spinal cordand nerve roots in the face of injury. Each of these factors must be considered separately. Many have a variable effect that is dependent upon the region of the spine injured. Therefore, region-specific anatomical and biomechanical factors must be understood and repetitively assessed.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

Visual attention deficit is sometimes described as blurry vision. Migraine auras often cause visual impairment. The chapter suggests modes of treatment for these situations.

      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations.

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition. Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐immunoglobulin‐like cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) disease is an autoimmune encephalitis that targets the cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5. The disease presents with various clinical features, including sleep disorders, bulbar palsy, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction and neuromuscular manifestations. Sleep disorders are characterized by parasomnias and sleep‐disordered breathing (stridor and sleep apnea). Bulbar palsy includes dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis and stridor. Movement disorders include a variety of symptoms and signs, such as chorea, dystonia, rigidity, tremor, myoclonus and myorhythmia. Cognitive dysfunction includes executive dysfunction, impairment of attention, and verbal and visual memory dysfunction. Neuromuscular manifestations include fasciculations in the tongue and peripheral muscles, limb weakness, and muscle atrophy. Some patients resemble those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On video polysomnography, undifferentiated non‐rapid eye movement sleep and poorly structured N2 sleep are characteristic. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies are often normal or non‐specific. Human leukocyte antigen testing shows that HLA‐DRB1*10:01‐DQB1*05:01 is highly associated with the disease. Pathologically, neuronal deposition of both hyperphosphorylated 3‐repeat and 4‐repeat tau isoforms, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum, and upper cervical cord are observed. Some patients are responsive to immunotherapies, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange therapy and rituximab. Factors associated with a favorable response to immunotherapies include early initiation of treatment, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) predominance of IgLON5 antibody compared with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). Anti‐IgLON5 disease should be suspected in patients with atypical movement disorders complicated by sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

This is a condition that can have long-term effects (especially if the duration is &gt;30 minutes) such as death, injury, and changes in neuronal tissue depending on the type and duration of the seizure. The human brain consumes a very disproportionate amount of energy given its relatively small size, thus requiring a system capable of balancing cellular oxygen metabolism and brain blood flow control in order to maintain brain oxygen levels. Seizures have been shown to cause changes in oxygen levels beyond the normoxic range, which increases the likelihood that seizure-induced changes in brain pO2 may affect brain function during and after seizures. Decreased oxygenation is common during epileptic seizures. This has been seen on digital pulse oximetry (which measures oxygenation of either the fingers or toes) in the 25-33% saturation range when they have seizures. Such hypoxemia is more common in seizures that are generalized (ie begin as or become generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and/or prolonged.",

Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions. The subject of peripheral neuropathy; its anatomy; and physiology, classification, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis is an extremely broad topic, and the intent of this chapter is to present a summary review, not an exhaustive analysis of the subject.",

Les encephalites infectieuses sont le plus souvent liees a des agents neurotropes, l’exemple typique etant represente par l’encephalite herpetique. Les lesions cerebrales predominent dans la substance grise du systeme nerveux central (SNC) et associent destruction neuronale et inflammation [2]. Les encephalites postinfectieuses sont caracterisees par des lesions aigues inflammatoires demyelinisantes predominant dans la substance blanche du SNC [3]. De nombreuses appellations ont ete utilisees dans la litterature pour decrire un meme syndrome (encephalite postinfectieuse, encephalite postvaccinale...), le terme encephalomyelite aigue disseminee (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, ADEM) est actuellement le plus utilise [4,5]. L’ADEM est mediee par un mecanisme auto-immun et s’installe en general dans les suites d’une infection ou d’une vaccination [6]. Il n’existe pas de marqueur biologique specifique de la maladie, le diagnostic est base sur un faisceau d’arguments anamnestiques, cliniques et radiologiques, cela en l’absence d’antecedent neurologique inexplique ou compatible avec un evenement demyelinisant anterieur, d’infection du SNC ou d’autre pathologie systemique [5].

      "abstract": "If the neurological symptoms worsen in patients with acute or subacute phase after spinal cord injuries, the physicians who treat patients with spinal cord injuries are embarrassed and confused about the treatment plan if the cause is unclear. The causes of neurological deterioration after spinal cord injury are not well studied. Neurologic deterioration of acute, subacute, or chronic periods was reported in 2–10% of patients with cervical cord injuries and in 15% of patients with entire spinal cord injuries. Many patients with neurologically deterioration with spinal cord injuries are associated with surgical intervention: epidural hematoma not evacuated, attempted reduction of kyphosis, or intraoperative injury. Additional neurological deterioration may occur after several years, although it may occur in the initial weeks or months after spinal cord injury. It can have a serious negative impact on functional abilities and may lead to anxiety about further loss of functional independence and deterioration of function after adjustment to spinal cord injury. This chapter describes the relatively less rare causes of neurological deterioration that are reported or expected in patients with spinal cord injuries.",

      "abstract": "Kejang adalah perubahan fungsi otak secara mendadak dan sementara akibat aktifitas nueron yang abnormal sehingga terjadi pelepasan listrik serebral yang berlebihan. Aktivitas ini dapat bersifat parsial atau general, berasal dari daerah spesifik korteks serebri atau melibatkan kedua hemisfer otak. Kejang disebabkan oleh banyak faktor, yaitu penyakit serebrovaskuler (stroke iskemik, stroke hemoragik), gangguan neurodegeneratif, tumor, trauma kepala, gangguan metabolik, infeksi susunan saraf pusat (SSP) seperti ensefalitis, meningitis. Penyebab lain adalah gangguan tidur, stimulasi sensori atau emosi, perubahan hormon, kehamilan, penggunaan obat-obatan yang menginduksi kejang (teofilin dosis tinggi, fenotiazin dosis tinggi), antidepresan (maprotilin atau bupropion), kebiasaan minum alkohol. Berdasarkan International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) dan International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) pada tahun 1981, epilepsi adalah suatu kelainan otak yang ditandai adanya faktor predisposisi yang dapat mencetuskan bangkitan epileptik, perubahan neurologis, kognitif, psikologis dan adanya konsekuensi sosial yang diakibatkannya. Diagnosa epilepsi ditegakkan melalui anamnesa, pemeriksaan fisik dan electroencephalography (EEG). Umumnya, epilepsi diterapi dengan obat antiepilepsi atau anti konvulsan. Apabila kejang tidak teratasi dengan obat oral, dapat dilakukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan, berupa non brain epilepsy surgery atau brain epilepsy surgery. Di Inggris, diperkirakan 0,5–2% total penduduk, menderita epilepsi, dimana 13% memerlukan terapi invasif atau pembedahan. Studi retrospektif, membuktikan, pengobatan invasif atau pembedahan pada epilepsi yang tidak respons terhadap obat oral, telah berhasil mengurangi serangan kejang. Penatalaksanaan anestesi pada epilepsi merupakan tantangan tersendiri bagi dokter anestesi. Diperlukan pemilihan gas, anestetika intravena dan teknik anestesi yang tidak memicu serangan kejang selama operasi. Interaksi dan efek samping obat anti epilepsi harus diperhitungkan saat anestesi.

If the seizures are not resolved, can be invasive or surgical therapy (non brain epilepsy surgery or brain surgery). In UK, 0,5 - 2% suffer from epilesy, 13% require surgical therapy. A retrospective study, prove that invasive treatment has succeeded. Management of anesthesia is a challenge for anesthesiology.

In evaluating the capacities of an individual after the occurrence of a head injury the total picture must be examined, for the disturbance is more than the sum of hemiplegia and epilepsy. Even if post-traumatic seizures do develop, it should be clearly understood that they do not forecast recurrent convulsive attacks. The contention that a few dizzy spells or momentary blackouts after a head injury, along with abnormal electroencephalographic findings, are sufficient to establish the diagnosis a chronic epilepsy is false, since neither these clinical manifestations nor abnormal brain waves are adequate for the diagnosis of a convulsive disorder per se.",

      "abstract": "Seizures occur when bursts of uncontrolled electrical activity translate into motor activity. Seizure activity takes on a variety of presentations, depending upon the patient and the degree to which one or both cerebral hemispheres are involved. Generalized seizures are characterized by whole-body involvement, collapse, and loss of consciousness. Patients often exhibit extensor rigidity in all four limbs. Limbs also frequently demonstrate paddling behavior. Unconscious behaviors, such as chewing, licking, swallowing, and vocalizing, may emerge during seizure activity. Autonomic signs may also appear. It is not uncommon for patients to lose control over their urinary bladders or bowels. At times, seizures may be difficult to differentiate from syncopal episodes. Thorough history taking may help to distinguish the two. Partial seizures, on the other hand, may resemble dyskinesias. Partial seizures involve one region of one cerebral hemisphere, and may therefore target any part of the body. The neck, trunk, or limbs are most commonly involved. There are many causes of seizures, regardless of whether they are generalized or partial. For ease of consideration, causes of seizure activity may be described as being intra- or extracranial. These categories prioritize differentials differently based upon the patient's age. In a pediatric patient, meaning one that is less than one year of age, seizures are most likely due to a developmental defect or traumatic injury. Other common causes of pediatric seizures include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), as from a portosystemic shunt (PSS) or neonatal hypoglycemia. Young adult to middle-aged patients, on the other hand, are more likely to develop idiopathic epilepsy, as compared to seniors, which are more likely to develop intracranial neoplasia. Most seizures are self-limiting. However, a fraction of seizures may become protracted, either in terms of their duration or frequency. Cluster seizures occur when the frequency of seizures exceeds two over a 24-h period. Status epilepticus occurs when either a seizure lasts for more than 5 min, or multiple seizures overlap such that patient recovery time between events is eliminated. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency.",

This can be the result of morphologic and functional changes underlying temporal lobe epilepsy. Epilepsy patients have increased risk of status epilepticus. It is a life-threatening condition when seizures last for more than 30 min and trigger processes leading to neuronal apoptosis and necrosis in various parts of brain. Administration of neuroprotective drugs preventing these pathologic processes could improve the prognosis for such patients. However despite of active research of neuroprotective drugs, the effective ways to prevent brain damage resulting from prolonged seizures are yet to be found. Studies of neuroprotective properties of classic and novel anticonvulsant drugs showed that most of them do not have the sufficient neuroprotective effect and are not able to prevent epileptogenesis. Thus the studies of other potential neuroprotective drugs seem to be promising.",

      "abstract": "Post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID) is a complication that affects long-term functional outcomes after stroke. Studies on dementia after long-term follow-up in stroke have focused predominantly on ischemic stroke, which may be different from the development of dementia after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this review, we summarize the existing data and hypotheses on the development of dementia after spontaneous ICH, review the management of post-ICH dementia, and suggest areas for future research. Dementia after spontaneous ICH has a cumulative incidence of up to 32.0–37.4% at 5 years post-ICH. Although the pathophysiology of post-ICH dementia has not been fully understood, two main theoretical frameworks can be considered: 1) the triggering role of ICH (both primary and secondary brain injury) in precipitating cognitive decline and dementia; and 2) the contributory role of pre-existing brain pathology (including small vessel disease and neurodegenerative pathology), reduced cognitive reserve, and genetic factors predisposing to cognitive dysfunction. These pathophysiological pathways may have synergistic effects that converge on dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and disruptions in functional connectivity leading to dementia post-ICH. Management of post-ICH dementia may include screening and monitoring, cognitive therapy, and pharmacotherapy. Non-invasive brain stimulation is an emerging therapeutic modality under investigation for safety and efficacy. Our review highlights that there remains a paucity of data and standardized reporting on incident dementia after spontaneous ICH. Further research is imperative for determining the incidence, risk factors, and pathophysiology of post-ICH dementia, in order to identify new therapies for the treatment of this debilitating condition.",

      "title": "Spinal Cord: Anatomical Overview and Selected Pathologies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The brain and the spinal cord work together to provide sensory perception and motor function to the body. These processes are accomplished by connections that occur between the brain and the peripheral nervous system through the spinal cord. Injury to the spinal cord can lead to significant deficits. Traumatic events can lead to compression, ischaemia or destruction of the spinal cord with consequential weakness, paralysis, sensory disturbances or urinary incontinence. Traumatic spinal cord injuries are classified as either complete (complete loss of motor and sensory function) or incomplete injuries (preservation of some motor or sensory function distal to the site of injury). The spinal cord can also be the site of aberrant neoplastic growth (spinal cord tumours) or immune‐modulated pathologies that lead to destruction and damage to the spinal cord (multiple sclerosis (MS)). Tumours, vascular diseases, infections, inflammatory diseases, demyelinating diseases and nutritional diseases can all result in damage to the spinal cord. Key Concepts: The vertebrae are specifically arranged to allow protection to the spinal cord as well as supporting and permitting movement of the trunk and limbs. The spinal cord is divided into distinct regions that provide innervation to different regions of the body. There are ascending sensory tracts and descending motor tracts connecting the spinal cord to the brain. These tracts are located regionally in the spinal cord according to their function, and injury to a particular region leads to symptoms that correlate with the respective function of the damaged area. Spinal cord tumours can be primary (arise from the spinal cord or its surrounding meninges) or secondary to metastatic spread. Tumours are classified according to their location relative to the dura mater, which surrounds the spinal cord. Vascular malformations result in abnormal flow of blood within the spinal cord. They often shunt blood directly between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary network. These malformations have a propensity to bleed. If an artery providing blood to the spinal cord is blocked or occluded, spinal cord infarct or stroke ensues. Pathogens in the blood can enter the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord) and lead to infection, inflammatory response and damage to the spinal cord. Inflammatory diseases often arise idiopathically (cause unknown); some association exists between viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Demyelination of nerves and destruction of spinal cord tracts typically result and is seen in conditions such as sarcoidosis, transverse myelitis and Guillain–Barré. Autoimmune diseases result when a maladaptive immune system recognises the host tissue as foreign material and mounts an inappropriate immune response. Multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are two disorders in which one's immune system mounts an attack against normal white matter of the CNS. Vitamin B12 is obtained through diet and is important for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath that surrounds neurons. Traumatic injury to the spinal cord most commonly occurs due to motor vehicle accidents and can lead to paraplegia (lower extremity paralysis) or quadriplegia (upper and lower extremity paralysis). An incomplete spinal cord injury is one in which some motor or sensory function is preserved distal to the level of injury. Treatment consists of realignment and stabilisation of the vertebral column, decompression of mass lesions and prevention of hypoxia and hypotension (preventing the spinal cord from being deprived of oxygen and blood nutrients).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "abstract": "Abstract: A case of a mixer operator who suffered severe head trauma (TBI) with data of left temporo-parietal intracerebral hemorrhage is presented.When regaining consciousness, she presented data of retrograde and antegrade amnesia, aphasia, left hemiplegia, anosognosia, associative visual agnosia and hearing loss, currently with short-term memory problems; Associative visual agnosia, sleep disturbances and starts with seizures. Introduction: TBI represents one of the most common causes of death and sequelae such as mild neurocognitive disorder (CLND) that is diagnosed with: clinical, Computerized Axial Tomography (CT) and cognitive evaluations: WAIS-IV, minimental, MoCA, Go test - no- Go; or Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTSD) characterized by late recurrent seizures not attributable to another cause with paroxysmal activity in the brain. Discussion: In the assessment of bodily harm in workers, the diagnosis of certainty must be established, collecting the mechanism of trauma and antecedents. In this case, the worker presented electoral crises two years 1 month after the TCE; Due to the time of appearance, it does not coincide with the clinical symptoms of CLNT in which they appear from the beginning and up to 6 months later, with the findings in the electroencephalogram and the adequate response to anticonvulsant, the existence of PTE was determined. Conclusions: It was possible to conclude the coexistence of EPT and TNCL, which in this case aggravated the expected cognitive deterioration of the TNCL, granting the fractions established in the Federal Labor Law (LFT) to which the worker is entitled.",

      "abstract": "Pain that accompanies deafferentation is one of the most mysterious and misunderstood medical conditions. Prevalence rates for the assorted conditions vary considerably but the most reliable estimates are greater than 50% for strokes involving the somatosensory system, brachial plexus avulsions, spinal cord injury, and limb amputation, with controversy surrounding the mechanistic contributions of deafferentation to ensuing neuropathic pain syndromes. Deafferentation pain has also been described for loss of other body parts (e.g., eyes and breasts) and may contribute to between 10% and upwards of 30% of neuropathic symptoms in peripheral neuropathies. There is no pathognomonic test or sign to identify deafferentation pain, and part of the controversy surrounding it stems from the prodigious challenges in differentiating cause and effect. For example, it is unknown whether cortical reorganization causes pain or is a byproduct of pathoanatomical changes accompanying injury, including pain. Similarly, ascertaining whether deafferentation contributes to neuropathic pain, or whether concomitant injury to nerve fibers transmitting pain and touch sensation leads to a deafferentation-like phenotype can be clinically difficult, although a detailed neurologic examination, functional imaging, and psychophysical tests may provide clues. Due in part to the concurrent morbidities, the physical, psychologic, and by extension socioeconomic costs of disorders associated with deafferentation are higher than for other chronic pain conditions. Treatment is symptom-based, with evidence supporting first-line antineuropathic medications such as gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Studies examining noninvasive neuromodulation and virtual reality have yielded mixed results.",

      "abstract": "Trauma to the nervous system may involve the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of death or disability in horses, especially young horses. In horses with traumatic brain injury and concurrent hypovolemic shock, autoregulatory mechanisms will be activated to protect the ischemic sensitive neurons of the brain and spinal cord by maintaining adequate blood flow. Evaluation of the level of consciousness, along with assessment of the cranial nerves, can help with the neuroanatomic localization of a brain injury. Important features of the examination include assessment of the horse's level of consciousness, head posture, coordination, behavior, and cranial nerve function. Treatment of traumatic brain injury may be further complicated by a need to treat injuries to other body systems. All treatment plans should include the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, sedatives, and a mechanism for long-term feeding.",

      "abstract": "A subject is conscious when he is awake and with an adequate awareness of him and the environment. The term alteration of consciousness requires specification as to whether it defines alteration of arousal - when the patient might be confused, in a stupor or in some degree of coma (light, deep) - or alteration of awareness – that is, confused (spatiotemporally disorientated, with difficulty in maintaining his attention), with or without delirious ideation. The coma, in the strict sense, originates from structural (neurological) or functional (metabolic) dysfunction of the ascending reticular activator system, but it is accepted that it can derive also from diffuse bihemispheric cortical-subcortical damage. In the emergency department the starting point is the triad of situations that requires immediate treatment applying the normal protocol (ABC); next, pathologies involving risk to life, which might cause cerebral hypoxia, are ruled out: diminished cardiac output, shock and respiratory failure. Subsequently, a neurological evaluation is made, bearing in mind two situations of potential gravity: endocraneal hypertension and diseases that might cause respiratory failure due to muscular fatigue. Neurological exploration will specify the respiratory, pupil and ocular patterns and motor responses. The depth of the coma is established through scales; a simplification of Jouvet’s scale is proposed. The etiological diagnosis will on occasion require image tests and lumbar puncture.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence in the United States, with an estimated incidence exceeding 1 million injuries per year. Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical impairments are common sequelae of TBI and may, in a significant minority of patients, persist well into the late period following injury. The etiology of these symptoms in individuals with mild TBI is controversial, with hypotheses of postconcussive symptom formation variously ascribing greater or lesser weight to neural damage, pre- and/or post-injury psychological or psychiatric factors, somatization, malingering, or some combination of these. Some of these hypotheses reflect biases common to medicolegal or compensation-related contexts, whereas others are derived from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies. Studies of the latter sort suggest that many of the typical postconcussive symptoms are associated with neurobiological dysfunction in one or more areas of the central nervous system. Whether these symptoms constitute a postconcussive syndrome per se is debatable. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe them as commonly co-occurring symptoms rather than as a syndromal sequela of TBI. The present review addresses these issues including the epidemiology and course of recovery from mild TBI and the validity of the postconcussive syndrome. Suggestions regarding the assessment and treatment of individuals with post-concussive symptoms are offered.",

      "title": "Understanding Traumatic Injury to the Human Brain",
      "abstract": "About this collection Your noggin, your noodle, your coconut, your bean! There are many terms for your brain, that fantastic organ that sits inside of your skull, and runs, well, everything, whether you are thinking about it or not. Although the skull is a hard, purpose-built case to protect the brain, we live in an active environment, in which expected events and unexpected accidents may cause what we call a “traumatic brain injury” – everything from concussion on the sport field, to falls from a bike or a ladder or a snowboard, to car accidents and everything in between. These different mechanisms of injury may cause contusions or bruises to the brain, like a bruise to a muscle, and may also result in bleeds in or around the brain, called hemorrhages. All of these types of brain injuries can result in damage to the actual brain tissue as well as cause interruptions to the complex electronic circuitry of the brain, causing symptoms like headaches, dizziness, fuzzy thinking, upset balance, memory loss, and poor sleep, to name just a few. Doctors are very good at treating the acute problems from a brain injury but we currently have no effective treatments for the actual injury to your brain and have to wait and see how the injury resolves on its own. While most people do recover spontaneously, for some, kids and adults alike, the symptoms can persist for a very long time, from months to years and sometimes permanently. If there is any positive that can come from injuring the brain, it is that sometimes the only way to understand how something works is to “break” it, and watch how it puts itself back to together. In this collection of articles, we’ll study the way we diagnose where and how the brain has been injured, how we treat the acute injury and discuss new models to enhance recovery of brain function. The first steps in our roadmap require a careful assessment of the details of the person’s accident, examining the person thoroughly, and then reviewing special imaging studies called computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that show us the structures of the brain, and how they are connected or disconnected following the injury. New blood tests can identify the presence of special biomarkers that indicate that there has been an injury to the brain itself, rather than just to the bony skull. Other important information can come from electroencephalography (EEG), which uses small sensors attached to the skull to capture and measure electronic signals traveling around the brain, to see where the interruptions may be occurring. We’ll learn about special surgeries, including hemicraniotomy, where the neurosurgeon “pops your top”, sometimes to relieve pressure on the brain, or to stop a hemorrhage from bleeding further, or to insert a protective metal plate. Surgeries and imaging studies give us a great deal of insight about the injured brain, but then what? Studies of other mammals, like rats and mice, can help us, but how, for instance, do we study a rat’s memory? We’ll find out how scientists accomplish this, and see how this knowledge might help patients recover memory after a brain injury. Importantly, we’ll also learn how can we protect our brains from injury, even when we can’t avoid the accidents that come with everyday life. We’ll explore emerging design of sports helmets and other gear, and learn how a strong neck and back can help prevent injury to the brain and spinal cord.",

Esta enfermedad puede clasificarse de acuerdo a la alteracion motora predominante en: (i) espastica (bilateral o unilateral); (ii) discinetica (distonica o coreoatetosica); (iii) ataxica; y (iv) no clasificable. Los factores de riesgo que se relacionan con la paralisis cerebral infantil pueden dividirse en prenatales, perinatales y postnatales siendo el principal la prematuridad, pero tambien influyendo las malformaciones congenitas, infecciones intrauterinas, morbilidad obstetrica y las infecciones del sistema nervioso central o traumatismos en el periodo postnatal. La manifestacion clinica que sugiere el sindrome es el retraso del desarrollo psicomotor entre los 12-18 meses de edad, la alteracion motora predominante dependera del sustrato neurologico afectado, mientras que pueden presentarse deficits cognitivos, epilepsia, trastornos visuales, auditivos y alteraciones musculo-esqueleticas secundarias. La valoracion a traves de las escalas de clasificacion de la funcion motora gruesa, de la manipulacion de objetos, la comunicacion o la alimentacion determina la severidad, guian el manejo clinico y permiten el seguimiento, por lo que se recomienda su utilizacion. El tratamiento es multidisciplinario con el objetivo de alcanzar el mayor grado de independencia funcional del paciente, por lo que es importante la prevencion de los factores de riesgo y de la asfixia perinatal.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is felt by all human beings on occasions. Usually it is of a minor nature (such as a headache or muscle strain) and improves quickly without pharmacological intervention. Rarely it is severe, usually following injury or after a surgical operation, and intensive pharmacological efforts may be needed to relieve the pain and distress. Thus we are all familiar with what pain is. In scientific terms pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as ‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage., or described in terms of such damage’. A painful stimulus is a protective response for the individual. Those with diminished or altered pain sensitivity may sustain severe joint injury and deformity or other tissue damage like burns because of the lack of pain sensation.",

Some of the neurological disorders listed out here. Pain in the head region is defined as a headache. Migraine, tension, and cluster are three common types of headaches. Transient disruptions in the electrical activity of the brain are defined as seizures and repeated seizures are called epilepsy. Focal seizures and generalized seizures are two different forms, and the differences include how they begin. A stroke is a cerebrovascular disease, also known as a brain attack, which occurs when something obstructs blood flow to a portion of the brain. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative condition resulting in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles and plaques in the brain causes Alzheimer's disease, which is the leading cause of dementia. Sleep disorders are conditions that interfere with your capacity to receive enough high-quality sleep and include several conditions, among which insomnia and sleep apnea are common. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neuromuscular condition characterized by muscle weakness. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by delusions (false beliefs), unusual behavior, and withdrawal from people in addition to muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis (MS).",

      "title": "Environmental Subconcussive Injury, Axonal Injury, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy",
      "abstract": "Brain injury occurs in two phases: the initial injury itself and a secondary cascade of precise immune-based neurochemical events. The secondary phase is typically functional in nature, and characterized by delayed axonal injury with more axonal disconnections occurring than in the initial phase. Axonal injury occurs across the spectrum of disease severity, with subconcussive injury, especially when repetitive, now considered capable of producing significant neurological damage consistent with axonal injury seen in clinically evident concussion, despite no observable symptoms. This review is the first to introduce the concept of environmental subconcussive injury (ESCI) and sets out how secondary brain damage from ESCI once past the juncture of microglial activation appears to follow the same neuron-damaging pathway as secondary brain damage from conventional brain injury. The immune response associated with ESCI is strikingly similar to that mounted after conventional concussion. Specifically, microglial activation is followed closely by glutamate and calcium flux, excitotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrous species (RNS) generation, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction and energy crisis. ESCI damage also occurs in two phases, with the primary damage coming from microbiome injury (due to microbiome-altering events) and secondary damage (axonal injury) from progressive secondary neurochemical events. The concept of ESCI and the underlying mechanisms have profound implications for the understanding of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) etiology because it has previously been suggested that repetitive axonal injury may be the primary CTE pathogenesis in susceptible individuals and it is best correlated with lifetime brain trauma load. Taken together, it appears that susceptibility to brain injury and downstream neurodegenerative diseases, like CTE, can be conceptualized as a continuum of brain resilience. At one end is optimal resilience, capable of launching effective responses to injury with spontaneous recovery, and at the other end is diminished resilience with a compromised ability to respond and/or heal appropriately. Modulating factors such as one's total cumulative and synergistic brain trauma load, bioavailability of key nutrients needed for proper functioning of restorative metabolic pathways (specifically those involved in the deactivation and clearance of metabolic by-products of brain injury) are key to ultimately determining one's brain resilience.",

      "title": "Nystagmus: Diagnosis, Topographic Anatomical Localization and Therapy",
      "abstract": "Nystagmus is defined as rhythmic, most often involuntary eye movements. It normally consists of a slow (pathological) drift of the eyes, followed by a fast central compensatory movement back to the primary position (refixation saccade). The direction, however, is reported according to the fast phase. The cardinal symptoms are, on the one hand, blurred vision, jumping images (oscillopsia), reduced visual acuity and, sometimes, double vision; many of these symptoms depend on the eye position. On the other hand, depending on the etiology, patients may suffer from the following symptoms: 1. permanent dizziness, postural imbalance, and gait disorder (typical of downbeat and upbeat nystagmus); 2. if the onset of symptoms is acute, the patient may experience spinning vertigo with a tendency to fall to one side (due to ischemia in the area of the brainstem or cerebellum with central fixation nystagmus or as acute unilateral vestibulopathy with spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus); or 3. positional vertigo. There are two major categories: the first is spontaneous nystagmus, i.e., nystagmus which occurs in the primary position as upbeat or downbeat nystagmus; and the second includes various types of nystagmus which are induced or modified by certain factors. Examples are gaze-evoked nystagmus, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, and hyperventilation-induced nystagmus. In addition, there are disorders similar to nystagmus, such as ocular flutter or opsoclonus. The most common central types of spontaneous nystagmus are downbeat and upbeat, infantile, pure torsional, pendular fixation, periodic alternating, and seesaw nystagmus. Many types of nystagmus allow a precise neuroanatomical localization: for instance, downbeat nystagmus, which is most often caused by a bilateral floccular lesion or dysfunction, or upbeat nystagmus, which is caused by a lesion in the midbrain or medulla. Examples of drug treatment are the use of 4-aminopyridine for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, memantine or gabapentin for pendular fixation nystagmus, or baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus. In this article we are focusing on nystagmus. In a second article we will focus on central ocular motor disorders, such as saccade or gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and gaze-holding deficits. Therefore, these types of eye movements will not be described here in detail.Unter einem Nystagmus versteht man rhythmische Augenbewegungen, die i. d. R. aus einer langsamen (ursächlichen bzw. pathologischen) Augendrift und einer schnellen kompensatorischen Rückstellbewegung (Rückstellsakkade) bestehen; die Richtung wird klinisch nach der schnellen Phase angegeben. Leitsymptome sind zum einen Verschwommensehen, „hüpfende oder laufende Bilder“ (Oszillopsien), verminderte Sehschärfe sowie manchmal Doppelbilder, die oft blickpositionsabhängig sind. Zum anderen können die Patienten, je nach Ursache, leiden unter 1. permanentem Schwankschwindel und Gangunsicherheit (wie beim Downbeat- [DBN] oder Upbeat-Nystagmus [UBN]), 2. Drehschwindel mit gerichteter Fallneigung (bei akutem Beginn) sowie 3. Lagerungsschwindel. Es lassen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Kategorien unterscheiden: 1. Spontannystagmus, d. h. ein Nystagmus, der in Geradeausblickposition auftritt, wie DBN oder UBN, und 2. verschiedene Nystagmusformen, die durch bestimmte Faktoren ausgelöst oder moduliert werden, wie Blickrichtungs-, Kopfschüttel-, Rebound-, Lagerungs-, hyperventilations- oder druckinduzierter Nystagmus. Daneben gibt es noch nystagmusähnliche schnelle Augenbewegungen wie Ocular Flutter oder Opsoklonus. Die häufigsten zentralen Formen eines Spontannystagmus sind DBN, UBN, infantiler Nystagmus, seltener sind Fixationspendelnystagmus, rein torsioneller, periodisch alternierender und See-saw-Nystagmus. Viele Nystagmusformen erlauben eine genaue anatomische Lokalisation, wie z. B. der DBN, der meistens auf einer beidseitigen zerebellären Flocculusläsion beruht oder der UBN auf einer Läsion im Mesenzephalon oder der Medulla oblongata. Beispiele einer Pharmakotherapie sind die Gabe von 4-Aminopyridin beim DBN und UBN, Memantin oder Gabapentin beim Fixationspendelnystagmus oder Baclofen beim periodisch alternierenden Nystagmus. Abschließend: in einem nachfolgenden Artikel werden in dieser Zeitschrift die häufigsten und klinisch relevanten zentralen Okulomotorikstörungen wie Sakkaden und Blickparesen, internukleäre Ophthalmoplegie oder Blickhaltedefekte dargestellt, sodass auf diese hier nicht detailliert eingegangen wird.",

      "title": "New symptoms in a patient with diagnosed porphyria – untypical clinical course or another disease? Extended differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Acute liver porphyrias are caused by mutations of genes encoding the heme biosynthesis enzymes. A lack of any of these enzymes leads to a decrease in the heme level, which in each case is manifested by identical clinical symptoms. Nervous tissue is particularly susceptible to a depletion of heme levels. Three classical symptoms of a porphyria attack include: abdominal pain (as a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy), peripheral neuropathy, and psychic disturbances. Apart from the main symptoms, porphyria attacks may be manifested as various neurological disturbances, such as: bulbar palsy, epileptic seizures, psychic disturbances and focal symptoms of CNS damage. The intensity of individual symptoms can vary. Although neurological symptoms usually disappear after the attack, they may cause permanent deficits. Through involving CNS, porphyria can mimic other neurological disorders. Damage to the nervous system can be confirmed by additional examinations. Thus far, disseminated focal changes during the attack, which disappear after the regression of clinical symptoms, have been described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Spinal cord abnormalities in MRI scans have not been described yet, despite the fact that damage to the anterior horn associated with porphyria has been confirmed in literature. While examining cerebrospinal fluid during the attack, an elevated protein level has been noticed, so far without the presence of oligoclonal bands. This paper aimed to demonstrate that porphyria should be considered in differential diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper is based on the case of a symptomatic patient who carried a mutation in one of the genes for porphyria, and who developed a clinical manifestation of focal damage to CNS. A differential diagnosis of porphyria and CIS, with a subsequent conversion to a clinically defined MS, was carried out. The results of additional examinations performed routinely in both disorders, the clinical picture and data from medical literature have been used in the analysis of this case. The authors present the case of a patient with confirmed genetic porphyria, who was hospitalized for purposes of establishing a diagnosis due to weakened lower extremities. The patient manifested spastic lower extremity paresis, sensation disorders and urinary incontinence, which indicated spinal cord damages. An MRI scan of the thoracic spine revealed disseminated foci with contrast enhancement. A high level of proteins and oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the basis of a new clinical picture (differing from the previous attack symptoms), prolonged symptoms, spinal cord lesions in MRI, and the presence of oligoclonal bands, CIS was diagnosed. Quick and complete recovery was obtained due to the administering of a steroid therapy. After several months, the patient reported a similar, passing episode, which, according to the authors, confirmed the diagnosis and an expected conversion to a clinically defined MS. Taking into consideration the clinical manifestation of spinal cord involvement untypical of porphyria, the detection of spinal lesions in an MRI scan, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and the positive effect of steroid therapy, the authors believe that this described patient, who was a symptomatic carrier of a mutation in a gene for porphyria, developed CIS. This reported case, supported by data from medical literature, shows that porphyria should be taken into consideration in any differential diagnosis of CIS and MS.",

Unlike physical disability after stroke, cognitive function usually worsens over time and are often overlooked with detrimental impacts on the quality of life of survivors. The risk factors for post-stroke dementia are multifactorial and includes genetic predisposition, demographic factors (like older age and lower education status), pre-stroke cognitive and functional status, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, vascular risk factors, characteristics and medical diseases associated with complications of stroke. Neuroimaging determinants are global cerebral atrophy or regional atrophy like hippocampal atrophy or medial temporal lobe atrophy, white matter lesions and changes, silent infarcts, lacunar infarcts and microbleeds. The mechanism of post-stroke dementia remains unknown and its neuropathology is poorly defined. Post-stroke dementia patients may benefit from target treatment of dementia with anti-dementia drugs as well as prevention and treatment of strokes. This review focus on the epidemiology, presumed mechanisms, recent studies on biomarkers, diagnostic workup and promising management strategies with functional outcome for post-stroke dementia.",

      "abstract": "New-onset vertigo, dizziness and gait imbalance are amongst the most common symptoms presenting to the emergency department, accounting for 2.1-4.4% of all patients. The broad spectrum of underlying causes in these patients cuts across many specialties, which often results in diagnostic challenges. For patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, i.e., presenting with acute-onset prolonged vertigo/dizziness with accompanying gait imbalance, motion intolerance, nausea/vomiting, with or without nystagmus), the typical differential diagnosis is vertebrobasilar stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy. However, other disorders may also present with AVS. These include non-neurological causes such as drug side-effects or intoxication, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac disease, severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, endocrine disorders and others. Other non-stroke neurological disorders may also present with AVS or episodic vertigo/dizziness, including demyelinating CNS diseases, posterior fossa mass lesions, acute thiamine deficiency and vestibular migraine. Furthermore, acute physiological abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, fever, severe anemia) may unmask previous vestibular impairments that had been well-compensated. Here, we review the diagnostic approach to patients with acute-onset dizziness in the emergency room and discuss the most important differential diagnoses beyond stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy.",

      "abstract": "this is a matter of isolated damage such as amnesia syndrome or if this is a case of diffuse damages that are characteristic of dementia.It is also important to differentiate confusing state from dementia.Confusing state is characterized by acute or sub-acute beginning, fluctuating course with consciousness disturbance, attention deficit, increased psychomotorics, common reversibility lasting for several days or weeks, whereas dementia has a slow start, progressive course without disturbance of consciousness and without distraction lasting a few months or years accompanied by irreversibility.Dementias are acquired, generalized and most frequently progressive disorders of cognitive functions that include intelligence, learning and memory, speech, problem solving, orientation, perception, attention, concentration, judgement and social abilities.Strong personality damages can also occur.They are diagnosed if impairment of cognitive functions disturbs work and social functioning of a person and shows a deterioration from the previous level of functioning.In diagnostics along with common neurological testing it is crucial to test cognitive status involving examination of memory, attention, speech functions, sensory and motor functions as well as integrative functions.Clinically, dementias are manifested by changes in cognition, fatigue, difficulties in planning and performing tasks, personality changes, behavioural changes.Demented patients are prone to detailed and extensive retelling, anger, sarcasm, pathetic expression of the face, aggression and emotional instability.The disease ultimately causes complete disability and such persons require adequate care.Dementia is not exclusively related to the geriatric age, but it may also occur earlier with diseases that alter brain function.Causes of dementia may be different.The so-called \"memo-VITAMINS test\" is applied and it indicates possible causes of dementia; these are vascular, infectious, toxic-metabolic, autoimmune, metastatic, androgenic, neurodegenerative and systemic causes.The most frequent is Alzheimer's dementia followed by a large group of dementias associated with parkinsonism involving dementia related to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewis relapses.[3] Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system; it is the most common type of dementia occurring in 5% of patients over the age of 50 and in 50% of patients over 80 years of age.It is also the most common cause of dementia in persons older than 65 years.The first and dominant disease symptom is a memory disorder along with disorders of speech function, praxies, gnostics and executive functions.The consequence is emergence of disturbances in three key areas of life: in daily life activities, behaviour and personality as well as cognitive functions. 1,2",

Diseases are classified as affecting primarily upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons, or both. Upper motor neuron diseases are characterized by muscle weakness, hyperreflexia, and spasticity, while lower motor neuron diseases are characterized by weakness, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations. Disease course is typically progressive. Age of onset, symptom severity, and disease course differ depending on the exact diagnosis and neurons affected. Patients with advanced disease may suffer from respiratory, pharyngeal, and skeletal muscle weakness, which have significant implications for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management.",

      "abstract": "Hemifacial weakness, or palsy, results from disruption of communication between cortical motor centres and the facial musculature along the course of the facial nerve. Bell's palsy has a typical presentation of sudden onset, mild otalgia, altered facial sensation and/or taste, with no obvious prodrome. It represents over half of hemifacial weakness cases in primary care. However, as a diagnosis of exclusion, there are a number of key clinical features of more sinister diagnoses that must be considered. Acute hemifacial weakness secondary to isolated facial nerve palsy must be differentiated from acute cerebrovascular accident. The latter results in sparing of the brow musculature due to the bilateral innervation of the frontalis. Altered facial sensation and mild otalgia are common in Bell's palsy, however severe pain is suggestive of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Recent facial or head trauma and surgery should also be excluded in causation. Patients with the following conditions should be referred: lagophthalmos if the weakness persists beyond a few days or ocular damage is suspected; Ramsay Hunt syndrome (immunocompromised patients, those with significant pain, and where intraoral vesicles prohibit oral intake); and palsy secondary to trauma or surgery. A parotid mass with facial palsy implies malignant change and must be referred within the two-week wait pathway. A history of progressive hearing loss and tinnitus with palsy also requires urgent referral to neuro-otology for assessment of cerebellopontine angle tumours. All cases of facial palsy associated with infective otological symptoms should be discussed with ENT.",

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

For the differential diagnosis, history and other symptoms are important such as hemiplegia, signs of brain stem dysfunction, meningism or headache. Metabolic, endocrinologic, toxicologic or electrolytic causes of coma usually can be diagnosed by laboratory examinations. Anamnestic informations, body inspection, clinical neurological examination as well as laboratory and imaging findings have to be added and categorized by a multilevel composition to establish a conclusive diagnosis. Simultaneously therapeutic measures for suspected primary cerebral diseases must be initiated, for example a rapid antibiotic treatment in case of a possible bacterial meningitis. A fast and structured diagnostic approach is crucial for ensuring a good prognosis and helps to miss relevant diagnostic steps. Potential diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls must be kept in mind.",

      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

Cerebrovascular diseases cause a high percentage of disability and mortality among the population. Stroke, by importance and frequency, ranks first in neurological diseases, and third in mortality after cardiovascular and malignant diseases. Disability of survivors is up to 50%. Hemiplegia is а complete paralysis on one side of the body, crosswise to the damaged side of the brain hemisphere. Most common reason for hemiplegia is stroke. General symptoms include vomiting, headache, loss of consciousness up to coma, meningitic syndrome. Clinical picture of hemiplegia is develops through several stages. First stage is flaccid or and lasts 10-14 days. The second stage is chronic or spastic and happens at 2-3rd week after the stroke. The cerebrovascular stroke is diagnosed by obtaining a medical history in which dominates longlasting headache, loss of consciousness and high blood pressure. Another method of diagnose is CT. On the other hand, MRI is sensitive and selective method. It can detect vascular malformation (aneurysm). The rehabilitation should start as soon as possible in order to prevent: contractures, decubitus or other skin damage. Depending of the patients improving,we start improving the quality of daily activities: dressing, using phone feeding, personal hygiene etc. Therefore, the role of the physiotherapist in hemiplegic patient’s life is very important because he has to work with the patient completely dedicated from the earliest to the final stage of the rehabilitation.",

Nightmares and night terrors are explained: night terrors are pure emotional experiences that occur on awakening from sleep and are typically associated with non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Nightmares are more likely to occur in REM sleep and, however unpleasant, are normal events suggesting that the maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep. Sleep walking, sleep talking, tooth grinding, post-traumatic dreams, and REM sleep behaviour disorder are also discussed.",

The forces to which the spinal column is subjected during injury can be compression, flexion, extension, distraction, rotation and shearing. The consequent damage will depend upon the level of the spine exposed to such energies and whether they act in isolation or combination. The principal concern with a spinal injury relates to any possible damage to the spinal cord and, to a lesser extent, the nerves issuing from it. The symptoms from which a spinal injury victim may complain are, for the most part, restricted to local pain, plus awareness of any loss of motor or sensory function. Signs of underlying skeletal damage may include local bruising, swelling, tenderness or deformity but the capacity to search for such signs may be limited, particularly in the victim of polytrauma. Neurological examination is needed as soon as practically possible.",

      "abstract": "Seizures are transient abnormal neuronal discharges of the cerebral cortex that often result in stereotyped behavior. Seizure is often a manifestation or symptom of many medical conditions. Epilepsy is the occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. In other words, a seizure is a sign, and epilepsy is a disorder. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of individuals reaching age 70 will have a seizure, but only 1–2% will be subject to recurrence and become epileptic. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with normal exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG), 15–30% have recurrence. Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "title": "Neurological complications of spinal anaesthesia",
      "abstract": "On a beaucoup écrit et discuté dans les conférences médicales sur les complications neurologiques de la rachi-anesthésie. La base de pes discussions réside dans l'mcidence et la gravité de ces complications. Les complications neurologiques immédiates sont en relation avec une élévation trop marquée de la solution anesthésique, qui produit une paralysie imprévue des nerfs et centres nerveux. Cette complication peut entramer la mort ou des altérations irréversibles du cerveau dues à l'anoxie. Parmi les complications ultérieures de la rachi-anesthésie, les céphalées sont les plus courantes. On a bien établi aujourd'iui que le type courant de céphalée post-rachi-anesthésique est provoqué par une perte du liquide céphalo-racoidien, qui déclenche une baisse de pression à l'mténeur du système D'autres facteurs importants sont la déshydratation, les traumatismes, la dimension de l'aiguille et l'appréhension. L'agent anesthésique lui-même ne paraît pas revêtir d'importance statistique. Pour prévenir l'apparition de céphalées, on recommande les mesures suivantes: emploi d'une petite aiguille, hydratation efficace, emploi des propriétés anti-diurétiques de l'extrait post-hypophysaire, et injection de soluté physiologique normal dans l'espace épidural quand on retire l'aiguille. Dans le passé, on a pallié à la plupart des céphalées consécutives à la rachianesthesie en couchant le malade en position dorsale, et par l'administration de composés d'aspirme. Les céphalées plus sérieuses et persistantes ont été traitées par des mjections mtravemeuses d'une solution à 5 pour cent de dextrose, pouvant contenir de l'acide nicotinique, par l'\"Enipirine\" et l'acide nicotinique; par la caféine et le benzoate de sodium; par des injections intra-rafchi-diennes ou épidurales de soluté physiologique normal (70-100 ml) ou de liquide céphalo-rachidien artificiel ou de solution de glucose, et par des injections mtraveineuses d'éthanol. D'autres types de céphalées post-rachi-anesthésiques peuvent être associées à des signes méningés, à une hypotension et à une présence élevée de cellules dans le liquide céphalo-rachidien. Les lésions des nerfs craniens qui suivent une rachi-anesthésie peuvent être dues à une altération des réactions intra-cervicales ou à un phénomàne méningé septique ou aseptique. Le nerf le plus couramment aflecté est le sixième nerf cranien. On a signalé la paralysie d'autres nerfs craniens. Heureusement cette complication se résout toujours d'elle-même avec le temps. L'Arachnoidite, la névrite radiculaire, la Néviite, la Myélite, le syndrôme Cauda Equina et la Vessie neurogène composent un groupe de complications extremèment sérieuses. L'apparition des symptômes peut être immédiate ou se développer peu à peu en quelques jours ou en quelques semaines. Parmi les causes possibles, citons: L'auteur est d'avis \"qu'en dépit des infinnités que l'on rencontre inévitablement dans les grands centres neurologiques, l'impression générate demeure que ces cas sont en réalité rares et qu'ils ne doivent pas entraîner l'abandon d'une forme d'anesthésie qui reste valablequand son emploi est indique\".",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

Peripheral nerve damage can result from trauma, surgery, anatomical abnormalities, entrapment, systemic diseases, or iatrogenic injuries. Trauma and iatrogenic injuries are the most common causes. The ulnar, median, and radial nerves are the most injured nerves in the upper extremities, while the sciatic and peroneal nerves are the most injured nerves in the lower extremities. The clinical symptoms of peripheral nerve damage include pain, weakness, numbness/tingling, and paresthesia. Therefore, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of peripheral nerve injuries are crucial. If a peripheral nerve injury is left untreated, it can lead to severe complications and significant morbidity. The sciatic nerve is one of the most affected nerves. This nerve is generally injured by trauma and iatrogenic causes. Children are more susceptible to trauma than adults. Therefore, sciatic nerve injuries are observed in pediatric patients. When the sciatic nerve is damaged, pain, weakness, sensory loss, and gait disturbances can occur. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of sciatic nerve injuries are important to avoid unexpected consequences. Ultrasound can play an important role in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury and the follow-up of patients. The aim of this case report is twofold. First, we aimed to emphasize the critical role of ultrasonographic evaluation in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve injuries and pathologies. Second, we aimed to present this case, which has distinguishing features, such as the existence of periostitis ossificans progressiva with sciatic neurotmesis due to a traumatic glass injury.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo.

      "title": "Psychiatric Aspects of Brain Injury in Childhood: A Review",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children suffering with brain injury or epilepsy run an appreciably increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The reasons for this are not clear, however. There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

Despite variable long-term outcomes across the range of severities based on the Glasgow Coma Scale classification, the majority of TBI cases, approximately 75%, are diagnosed as mild TBI. The primary injury to the brain is a result of sudden acceleration, deceleration, and/or rotational forces. The acceleration and deceleration of the brain can cause cortical contusions and hemorrhages when the brain hits the skull. In TBI, the secondary injury cascade ultimately results in necrotic or apoptotic cell death that contributes to measurable cerebral atrophy due to neuronal loss.",

It must be considered, however, that in many cases the early manifestations may not reveal the seriousness of the lesion fully and may be misleading. On the other hand, the first symptoms may indicate a more grave condition than the subsequent history will confirm. The early symptom most generally observed in serious head injuries is a state of unconsciousness. What this may signify can not always easily be determined from the symptom alone. The question of importance in this connection to be considered at an early moment is, whether the unconsciousness is from hemorrhage, or from concussion or contusion of the brain.

      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

      "title": "Occipital Neuralgia — A Masquerading Cause of Concussion Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Occipital neuralgia (ON) is an often-undiagnosed cause of head and neck pain. Potential etiologies of ON are wide and include head and neck trauma, such as whiplash and concussion injuries, atlantoaxial joint instability, or as a complication after radiofrequency ablation. Patients commonly complain of severe attacks of shooting or stabbing pain in the nuchal area around the greater occipital nerve (GON) distribution that is exacerbated by movement or palpation of the neck. Because of the location and characteristics of the pain and the associated symptoms, this condition can be easily mistaken for tension headaches with myofascial components, cervicogenic headaches, radiculopathies, or atypical migraines. If precipitated by head trauma, such as a concussion, ON typically presents subacutely between 1 and 3 months postinjury. Associated symptoms can include tinnitus, nausea, dizziness, and visual changes, which lends significant overlap between ON and postconcussive syndrome (1). Pearl: Consider a diagnosis of ON in patients with a recent history of concussion who have cessation of symptomatic improvement weeks after their injury, or have worsening symptoms including headache, nausea, dizziness, and/or photophobia. The physical examination of patients with ON can be extremely helpful in differentiating it from other types of headaches and other concussive sequelae. Tenderness to compression and/or a positive Tinel's sign can often be appreciated along the course of the GON, particularly at the proximal end of the GON typically located 2 cm inferior and 2 cm lateral to the occipital protuberance. Pain may radiate along the scalp as distal as the fronto orbital region, but need not be in a contiguous distribution. The lesser occipital nerve also may be affected, which may be found lateral to the GON along the superior nuchal ridge. Of note, the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) has been used to determine if symptoms during prolonged postconcussion recovery are because of the concussion (abnormal physiologic response to exercise) or because of a concomitant depression, cervical injury, vestibular/ocular dysfunction, or a posttraumatic headache syndrome (normal physiologic response to exercise) (2). In our clinical experience, the BCTT does not perform well at distinguishing between ON and concussion. This may be because of the communications between the occipital nerves and various cranial nuclei, including that of the vagus nerve, which may contribute to an abnormal physiologic response to exercise (3). Diagnostic confirmation of ON can instead be achieved via the use of a diagnostic nerve block on the affected occipital nerve. Pearl: A diagnostic nerve block may be superior to the use of the BCTT at distinguishing between concussion and ON symptom etiologies. There is no current consensus on the optimal treatment method for ON given the lack of randomized controlled studies. Treatment options include standard conservative methods (hot or cold compresses and postural readjustments), pharmacological approaches (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and neuropathic medications), and various intervention options (botulinum toxin injections). In our clinical experience, diagnostic blocks of the occipital nerves often have significant therapeutic benefit, which is supported by the positive findings in one medium-sized prospective study (4). Pearl: Occipital nerve blocks can be efficacious in treating patients with ON. For those patients with a positive but temporary response to the block, radiofrequency ablation of the third occipital nerve commonly results in more sustained improvement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The classical definition of cortical blindness in both adults and children refers to complete loss of vision, including appreciation of light and dark, loss of OKN with preservation of pupillary responses, normal eye motility and normal retina on examination. Cerebral visual impairment (CVI) is now recommended as a better term. Complete blindness is rare in these patients. Most of them have some residual vision, which it is often difficult to test because they show inattention and variability in their visual performance. Secondly, ‘cerebral’ seems to be a more appropriate term than ‘cortical’. Visual impairment is secondary to a cerebral disease from multiple causes (e.g. infection, trauma, cerebrovascular disease, etc.), involving retrochiasmatic visual pathways but not necessarily the visual cortex. According to the timing of the cerebral injury, CVI in children can be classified as congenital or acquired. The latter can be caused by meningitis, encephalitis, head trauma, hydrocephalus, or metabolic derangements. Occipital infarctions are often observed in these cases. Congenital CVI includes visual loss caused by malformations, intrauterine infections or perinatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is the most common cause of CVI, and is often accompanied by other motor and cognitive impairment owing to the diffuse nature of this pathology.",

Results: Most lightning-related neurologic damage involves the CNS as opposed to the peripheral nervous system. The neurologic syndromes can be divided into the following four groups: immediate and transient, immediate and prolonged or permanent, delayed, and traumatic lesions secondary to falls and blast effects. Neurobehavioral complications are frequent and resemble the symptoms of patients with traumatic brain injury. Treatment of CNS lesions, such as posthypoxic encephalopathy and intracranial hemorrhages, is similar to that applied to patients with traumatic brain injury. Many patients with lightning strike are healthy, young individuals engaged in outdoor recreational activities. The mechanism of tissue injury is discussed. Conclusion: Lightning is an awesome force that is responsible for devastating neurologic conditions.",

Typically, the pattern is one of generalized neuronal necrosis within well-defined brain stem cranial nerve nuclei, or random neuronal degeneration within the reticular formation. More recently, isolated cases of severe partial or total cystic necrosis of the brain stem reticular formation have been recorded. The pathogenesis is poorly understood at this time, but may be similar to the less severe (but more often recognized) nuclear or focal neuronal loss. Three infants are presented in which severe necrosis of the brain stem occurred. In each, the clinical setting was one of sudden and abrupt worsening of the patient's cardiovascular status.

      "title": "Physiological Responses to Hypoxia in the Absence of Brain Glycogen",
      "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose and is an important form of energy storage in mammals. The brain is able to form glycogen in astrocytes and neurons via glycogen synthase and branching enzyme. Once formed, brain glycogen functions as the only stored energy source for these cells. Various physiological roles for brain glycogen have been hypothesized, including memory consolidation and sleep regulation, as well as a protective role during various physiological stressors, such as hypoglycemia and hypoxia. For instance, rat brain glycogen levels were decreased 10 minutes after vaginal birth, but not after a C-section. This suggested that cerebral hypoxia experienced during vaginal birth induced the utilization of brain glycogen to minimize neurodegeneration during the hypoxic event. Symptoms of hypoxia can range from tachycardia, tachypnea, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis to confusion, loss of motor coordination and cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and brain death. The many causes of hypoxia include lungs diseases (COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary edema), CNS depressants (opiates), heart problems (CHF), anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We hypothesized that the lack of brain glycogen would cause a noticeable detrimental effect to the survival time and physiologic functions of mice exposed to acute hypoxia. Experimental Design or Project Methods: We subjected mice, with or without glycogen synthase disrupted in the brain, to carbon dioxide- or nitrogen-induced hypoxia and monitored effects on brain glycogen levels, behavior, and survival time. Results: We found that mice lacking brain glycogen exhibited the characteristic physiologic responses to hypoxia, but expired ~50% sooner than mice with brain glycogen. Conclusion and Potential Impact: These results provide evidence that brain glycogen is imperative in responding to hypoxic events. Further, these findings suggest that brain glycogen may protect patients with OSA against other comorbidities, especially neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "When a person with a head injury arrives at the hospital, doctors and nurses first check life signs: cardiac work, blood pressure and breathing. For those who do not breathe satisfactorily, a extractor fan may be required. Doctors immediately assess the patient's state of mind and memory. They also test the brain's basic functions by checking the size of the pupils and their response to light, assessing reactions to sensations such as heat and stab of the needle, and testing the ability to move their arms or legs. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is required to evaluate possible brain injury. Traumatic brain injury occurs when an external mechanical force causes brain dysfunction. Brain trauma is usually the result of a violent hit to the head. An object that pierces the skull, such as a bullet, can also cause brain trauma. Mild trauma can be caused by temporary brain cell dysfunction. More serious brain trauma can lead to bruising, torn tissue, bleeding and other physical injuries to the brain, which can result in long-term complications or even death. Head injuries are the cause of disability and death of people under the age of 50, more than any other type of neurological impairment. Nearly half of people with severe head injuries die. The brain can be damaged even when the skull is not pierced.",

      "title": "Latent Spinal Cord and Brain Stem Injury in Newborn Infants",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Spinal cord and brain stem injuries occur often during the process of birth, but frequently escape diagnosis. Respiratory depression in the neonate is a cardinal signal of such injury. In infants who survive there may be lasting neurologic defects reflecting the primary injury; in some, secondary hypoxic damage to the cerebrum may ultimately be manifested as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or other central nervous system defects. A broad range of lesions occur, due to stretch‐injury or to compression of the substance of the cord and brain stem. Laceration and hemorrhage of the cord and brain stem occur. The spinal and cranial nerve roots may be damaged, as well as dura and neighboring structures; spinal epidural hemorrhage is common. On the basis of the present investigation and past clinical and pathologic studies it is believed that brain stem and spinal injuries at birth are essentially attributable to excessive longitudinal traction, especially when this force is combined with flexion and torsion of the spinal axis during delivery. Contributing factors include prematurity, primiparity, intrauterine malposition of the fetus, dystocia and precipitous delivery. The occurrence of spinal cord or brain stem injury in 10 to 33 per cent of neonatal deaths autopsied, reported in the past and reflected in the present study, indicates the significance of this form of birth trauma–and the need for wider consideration of this form of nervous system damage and its sequelae in infants who survive. RÉSUMÉ Lésion latente de la moelle épinière et du tronc cearébral chez les nouveaux‐nés Des lésions de la moelle épìnière et du cerveau se produisent souvent au cours de l'accouchement, mais elles échappent fréquemment au diagnostic. L'insumsance respiratoire chez le nouveauné est un signe cardinal de telles lésions. Chez les enfants qui survivent, il peut y avoir des troubles neurologiques persistants reflétant la lésion primaire; chez certains, des dégats hypoxiques secondaires du cerveau peuvent se manifester par la suite sous forme d'infirmité motrice cérébrale, retard mental, ou autres troubles du système nerveux central. Une grande variété de lésions peuvent se produire, dûes a rétirement ou à la compression de la substance de la moelle ou du tronc cérébral. Laceration et hémorragie de la moelle et du tronc cérébral peuvent avoir lieu. Les racines des nerfs rachidiens et crâniens peuvent être endommagés, de même que la dure‐mère et les structures voisines; l'hémorragie rachidienne épidurale est fréquente. En se basant sur les recherches présentes et les études cliniques et pathologiques antérieures, les auteures pensentque les lésions du tronc cérébral et de la moelle épinière a la naissance peuvent être essentiellement attributeée à une traction longitudinale excessive, en particulier lorsque cette force est associée à une flexion et une torsion de l'axe rachidien au cours de l'accouchement. Les facteurs favorisants comprennent la prématurité, la primiparité, la mauvaise position intrautérine du foetus, les dystocies, et l'accouchement précipité. La présence de lésion de la moelle épinière ou du tronc cérébral dans 10 à 33 pour cent des morts néonatales autopsyées, rap‐portée auparavant et confirmée dans l'étude présente, souligne l'importance de cette forme de traumatisme de naissance et la nécessité d'accorder plus ample considération à cette forme d'alteration du systéme nerveux et de ses séquelles chez les enfants qui survivent. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Latente Rückenmark‐und Hirnstammschäden bei neugeborenen Kindern Rückenmark‐ und Hirnverletzungen treten oft beim Geburtsvorgang auf, entgehen jedoch häufig der Diagnose. Ein Kardinalsympton solcher Verletzungen sind die Atemstörungen in der Neugeborenenperiode. Bei Kindern, die uberleben, können neurologische Ausfälle, die den primären Verletzungen entsprechen, bestehen bleiben; bei einigen können sekundäre hypoxische Hirnschäden schliesslich als zerebrale Lähmung, als geistige Retardierung oder als andere zentralnervöse Ausfälle in Erscheinung treten. Es gibt eine Vielzahl von Verletzungen, die durch die Zerrung oder die Kompression des Rückenmarkes oder des Hirnstammes entstehen. Zerreissungen und Blutungen im Rückenmark und Hirnstamm kommen vor. Die spinalen und die kranialen Nervenwurzeln, sowie die Dura und die benachbarten Strukturen können verletzt sein; eine epidurale Blutung im Bereich des Rückenmarks ist nicht ungewöhnlich. Auf Grund der vorliegenden Forschungssergebnisse und früherer klinischer und pathologischer Untersuchungen wird angenommen, das Hirnstamm‐ und Rückenmarkverletzungen bei der Geburt hauptsächlich einer übermässigen Zerrung zuzuschreiben sind, besonders wenn diese Gewalteinwirkung mit einer Beugung und Drehung der Wirbelsäule verbunden ist. Als begünstigende Faktoren sind Frühreife, Erstgeburt, falsche Lage des Feten im Uterus, Dystonie und überstürzte Geburt anzusehen. Wie schon früher berichtet und durch die vorliegenden Untersuchungen bestätigt, kommen autoptisch gesicherte Rückenmark‐ und Hirnstammverletzngen bei 10 bis 33 prozent der verstorbenen Neugeborenen vor. Dies zeigt die Signifikanz derartiger Geburtstraumen und die Notwendigkeit, die in dieser Form auftretenden Schäden am Nervensystem und ihre Folgeerscheinungen bei den überlebenden Kindern mehr zu berücksichtigen. RESUMEN Daño latente de la médula espinal y el tronco cerebral en recién nacidos Muchas veces lesiones de la médula espinal y del cerebro ocurren durante el parto, pero frecuentemente no se diagnostican. Una depresión repiratoria en el neonato es un signo cardinal de tal lesión. En lactantes que sobreviven se encuentran muchas veces defectos neurológicos de larga duratión debidos a la lesion primaria; en algunos, daño cerebral secundario hipóxico puede manifestarse más tarde como parálisis cerebral, retardación mental, u otro defecto del sistema nervioso central. Hay una gran variedad de lesiones, debidas a extensión a compresión de los tejidos de la médula y del tronco cerebral. Se encuentran laceración y hemorragia de la médula y del tronco cerebral. Hay a veces daño de las raíces nerviosas espinales y craneales, además de daño de la dura y de estructuras vecinas, y muchas veces se encuentra hemorragia espinal epidural. Al considerar los hallazgos de este estudio y los de otros estudios clinicos y patológicos, el autor concluye que lesiones del tronco cerebral y del raquis al necimiento resultan principalmente de tractión longitudinal excesiva, sobre todo cuando esta fuerza se une a flexión y tosion del eje espinal durante el parto. Factores contribuyentes comprenden prematuridad, primiparidad, malposición intrauterina del feto, distocia, y parto precipitoso. La ocurrencia de lesiones de la médula espinal y del tronco cerebral en el 10 hasta el 33 por ciento de las autopsias de neonatos fallecidos indica la significancia de esta forma de traumatismo del parto y la necesidad de considerar más ampliamente este tipo de daño al sistema nervioso y sus consecuencias en lactantes que sobreviven.",

      "title": "Neuropathic pain and diabetes",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a common phenomenon resulting from injury to the central or peripheral nervous system. The means by which diabetes results in nerve injury is unclear but the effect is to cause injury at all levels of the nervous system from the level of the peripheral nerves to the brain. Nerve injury causes pain through a cascade of mechanisms resulting in altered processing of sensory input into the nervous system. This alteration occurs through chemical and anatomical changes in the nervous system that are similar to some of the processes seen in central sensitisation following acute pain. Following nerve injury, neuropathic pain occurs not only when these mechanisms are activated but also when sensitisation is maintained. Other processes occurring in neuropathic pain appear to be a loss of normal inhibitory controls as seen by a reduction in local GABA-ergic and descending monoaminergic influences. There are also important changes mediated via glial cells that can maintain neuropathic pain. Diabetes affects all areas of the nervous system and the contribution of higher levels of the nervous system is often overlooked. Neurophysiological and MRI evidence strongly suggest that these may contribute to the pain of diabetic neuropathy. Psychological dysfunction in diabetic patients is an important factor in increasing the suffering associated with all aspects of the disease, but treatment and control of pain can greatly improve the quality of life.

      "title": "SODIUM OXYBATE AS A TREATMENT FOR DBS–RESISTANT, ALCOHOL–RESPONSIVE POST–ANOXIC MYOCLONUS",
      "abstract": "Myoclonic jerks are sudden shock–like involuntary movements, either manifesting as a brief contraction of a group of muscles (positive) or cessation of muscle activity (negative), driven by aberrant activity in one of the cortex, subcortical regions, brainstem or spinal cord. Its aetiology is variable and can occur physiologically, in a primary myoclonic syndrome (myoclonus–dystonia), or as part of an epilepsy (Progressive myoclonic epilepsy) or neurodegenerative syndrome (Alzheimer9s disease, multiple systems atrophy). Myoclonus can also occur secondary to hypoxic brain injury either in an acute (myoclonic status epilepticus) or a chronic form, eponymously titled Lance–Adams syndrome (LAS). LAS is characterised by a non–progressive generalised myoclonus with added seizures and ataxia. There is no curative management strategy, only symptomatic relief. A multidisciplinary approach involving medical, physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy achieves the best holistic outcomes for patients. Case studies suggest certain antiepileptic agents may alleviate symptoms, but combinations are often required, and the most effective options have sedative side effects. A subset of cases have marked alcohol responsiveness that can lead to dependence. A number of experimental treatment options have been proposed including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and sodium oxybate, a sodium salt of gamma–Hydroxybutyrate. In what follows, a patient with an eleven year history of the LAS is presented and the experimental therapeutics explored, concluding with a recent trial of sodium oxybate. Sodium oxybate was well tolerated and produced improvements in the patient9s symptoms and perceived disability. This case highlights the difficulties of managing chronic myoclonic conditions and suggests sodium oxybate may be a useful treatment option in these patients.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months, often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay, signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and any one of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging Typical neuropathologic changes Typical neuropathology in a similarly affected sib Identification of a pathogenic variant in one of the 14 mitochondrial genes known to be involved in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of NARP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and identification of a heteroplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the three mitochondrial genes known to be involved in NARP. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive treatment includes use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis and anti-seizure medication for seizures. Dystonia is treated with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin alone or in combination, or by injections of botulinum toxin. Anticongestive therapy may be required for cardiomyopathy. Regular nutritional assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of diet and psychological support for the affected individual and family are essential. Surveillance: Neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiologic evaluations at regular intervals to monitor progression and appearance of new symptoms. Care is frequently coordinated by a biochemical geneticist in North America, and by a metabolic physician/pediatrician elsewhere in the world. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate and barbiturates, anesthesia, and dichloroacetate. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP are transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. In most cases, the mother has a much lower proportion of abnormal mtDNA than the proband and usually remains asymptomatic or develops only mild symptoms. Occasionally the mother has a substantial proportion of abnormal mtDNA and develops severe symptoms in adulthood. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk; all offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk to offspring of a female proband of developing symptoms depends on the tissue distribution and proportion of abnormal mtDNA. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for couples at increased risk of having children with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP are possible by analysis of mtDNA extracted from non-cultured fetal cells or from single blastomeres, respectively. However, long-term outcome cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of molecular genetic test results.",

      "abstract": "A child or adolescent perfect health has just suffered a generalized epileptic seizure or typical petit-mal blackouts. Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic. Such designations are certainly open to question. However, they have prevailed, and ought to be retained. They do not indicate that this type of epilepsy has no cause but that, according to the expression of Castaigne (1968), in the case question epilepsy is the very essence of the disease, and",

Axons that project up from the brain stem are vulnerable, even in milder concussive injuries, and include axons that participate in key monoaminergic pathways. Although called diffuse axonal injury, the supra-tentorial injury component typically shows an anterior preponderance in humans. As the injury forces increase, cerebral contusions may be superimposed on the axonal strain injuries, and these contusions show an anterior preponderance as well. The chronic neuropsychiatric manifestations of TBI reflect this injury distribution. In the cognitive sphere, these manifestations almost always include power function disturbances marked by difficulties with cognitive processing speed, multitasking, and cognitive endurance. These disturbances may then be followed by disturbances in executive function and self-awareness as injury severity increases. In the behavioral sphere, mood disturbances and disorders of behavioral control and regulation are particularly common.",

On the basis of evoked potential data, the presence of decortication or decerebration depended on cerebral hemispheric dysfunction. Brain-stem dysfunction, defined by evoked potentials, did not correlate with posturing. On the other hand, impaired oculocephalic responses and bilateral abnormal pupillary light responses were associated with brainstem dysfunction, while hemispheric dysfunction did not correlate with either: Duration of coma was dependent on hemispheric dysfunction. Brain-stem dysfunction was not significantly associated with prolonged coma. Furthermore, 80% of the head trauma patients who had Grade I or II multimodality evoked brain-injury potentials recorded in the acute period following head trauma (mean Day 3) became responsive within 30 days of their injury. Graded somatosensory brain injury potentials appeared to be a powerful prognostic tool as they significantly correlated with the patient's final outcome even when recorded early after injury. Abnormal multimodality evoked potentials recorded acutely consistently defined dysfunction of the visual, auditory, and motor systems in comatose patients, and were considerably more effective than the clinical neurological examination in diagnosing persisting focal deficits of these systems.",

Increased morbidity and mortality may occur through subsequent cerebrovascular events, and progression to dementia might result from multiple cerebral infarcts.

The clinical manifestations and the course of diffuse axonal injuries are characterized by protracted coma occurring immediately after the injury with marked disorders of stem functions, postural motor reactions, slow recovery from coma, with the formation of a stable or transitory vegetative state, the development of syndromes of disconnection of the cerebral hemispheres and the brain stem, and severe invalidization of the patients due to mental and neurological deficits.",

      "abstract": "Endocrine dysfunction is a common problem in acute brain injury patients. Various mechanisms have been described as responsible for disruptions to the neuroendocrine system. They can result from increased intracranial pressure, hypoxia, inflammation, or the direct mechanical impact of high-energy trauma. Clinical features of hormonal disorders associated with traumatic brain injury, acute stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are numerous. Furthermore, presented symptoms may appear unspecific and be overlooked, especially in comatose or mechanically ventilated patients. The cautious diagnostic and therapeutic approach is extremely important and, in some cases, may be life-saving. Appropriate management of endocrine dysfunction following acute brain injury is essential for an improved future outcome. Current research concentrates predominantly on the prognostic value of endocrine disorders. Specific recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic work-up designed for acute brain injury patients are still missing.",

As condições mais associadas a esses prejuízos são depressão, delirium, comprometimento cognitivo leve e demência. Os mecanismos envolvidos ainda não estão estabelecidos, mas alguns fatores, como dano neuronal induzido pelas toxinas urêmicas, lesões cerebrovasculares isquêmicas, estresse oxidativo, inflamação crônica, anemia, hiper-homocisteinemia e disfunção endotelial, podem ser importantes. O desempenho neuropsicológico tende a melhorar com o início da diálise, apesar de algumas disfunções cognitivas permanecerem alteradas mesmo após a instituição do tratamento, principalmente nos domínios de atenção, flexibilidade cognitiva, memória e aprendizagem. O transplante renal pode melhorar e, inclusive, reverter alguns déficits cognitivos, apesar de prejuízos na memória verbal e nas funções executivas poderem permanecer. O diagnóstico do declínio cognitivo nos pacientes renais crônicos pode ter impacto no manejo e no prognóstico.

Clinical signs during a seizure fall into 4 categories: motor signs, apparent disturbances of consciousness, autonomic signs, and behavioral changes. Anything that alters neuronal function in the brain is potentially seizure producing. Such altered neuronal function can have its primary origin in either extracranial or intracranial disease processes. Hypoglycemia, hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy, and lead poisoning are extracranial causes of seizures; neoplasia, encephalitis, toxicosis, head trauma, hydrocephalus, and idiopathic epilepsy are intracranial causes. A routine approach to the differential diagnosis and treatment of canine seizure disorders is presented.",

The most common symptoms that remained were physical and mental tiredness, subdued or depressed mood, impaired concentration, reduced physical activities and yawning; weak or clumsy limbs, head tenderness, neck ache or stiffness, impaired sight and altered fluid balance were less frequent. The number of symptoms ranged from 2 to 11 (average 6) per patient lasting for a mean of 18 h, usually the whole of the next day. Symptoms after the main migraine attack can help to diagnose migraine particularly when there is no aura before the onset of headache. Eliciting postdromes aids patient-doctor rapport and confidence.

The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "abstract": "Common causes of memory loss in older people are mild cognitive impairment, the various types of dementia, and psychiatric illness, mainly depression. Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

There is no evidence of causative pathology. The basic functional disturbance is likely to involve arousal mechanisms ('dyshormia') and/or photosensitivity. The genetic factor is highly complex. This entity must be differentiated from electrically or epileptologically very similar conditions. Among 300 epileptics with predominantly generalized seizure discharges in the EEG, only 20% (61 patients) fell into the category or 'pure' CGE; another 24% (72 patients) were listed as atypical CGE and showed additional minimal focal abnormalities or evidence of insult to the brain in the history. Other conditions giving rise to generalized seizure discharges are hereditary essential myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora-Unverricht-Lundborg), deep seated lesions (hypothalamus, mesencephalon) and metabolic disturbances; this group amounted to no more than 4% (12 patients). A primary cortical epileptogenic focus giving rise to 'secondary bilateral synchrony' was presumed in 9% (26 patients). A large group of 125 patients (42%) were characterized by slow spike-wave complexes and mental retardation (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). The 4 remaining patients (1%) had slow spike-wave complexes but represented an unusual type of post-traumatic epilepsy without the ictal-clinical symptomatology of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

      "title": "FBXL4-Related Encephalomyopathic Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome is a multi-system disorder characterized primarily by congenital or early-onset lactic acidosis and growth failure, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Other neurologic manifestations can include seizures, movement disorders, ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and stroke-like episodes. All affected individuals alive at the time they were reported (median age: 3.5 years) demonstrated significant developmental delay. Other findings can involve the heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart malformations, arrhythmias), liver (mildly elevated transaminases), eyes (cataract, strabismus, nystagmus, optic atrophy), hearing (sensorineural hearing loss), and bone marrow (neutropenia, lymphopenia). Survival varies; the median age of reported deaths was two years (range 2 days – 75 months), although surviving individuals as old as 36 years have been reported. To date FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome has been reported in 50 individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FBXL4 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including neurology, nutrition, clinical genetics/metabolism, and developmental pediatrics. Other specialties may be involved as needed. To date no definite treatment is available; thus, treatment is mainly supportive: assuring adequate nutrition and standard treatment of neurologic complications including developmental delay / intellectual disability, seizures, cardiac complications, eye involvement, and hearing loss. Administration of cofactors and antioxidants, used in mitochondrial disorders with (generally) limited evidence of benefit, may be considered. Surveillance: No surveillance guidelines have been published. The treating physician should decide about the frequency of follow up of eyes, hearing, heart, feeding difficulties, liver, neurologic complications, and neutropenia based on the patient's findings. Genetic counseling FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are heterozygous carriers, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier (heterozygote), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the FBXL4 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "abstract": "textabstractA spinal cord injury (SCI) is an interruption of the neural pathways in the spinal canal\nand is characterized by muscle weakness, loss of sensation and autonomic dysfunction\nbelow the level of the lesion. The extent of these neurological deficits is determined\nby both the level and completeness of the lesion. A complete lesion results in loss\nof motor function and sensation in the lowest sacral segment whereas, following an\nincomplete lesion function in this segment is maintained.1 The SCI can either have\na traumatic or a non-traumatic cause. In traumatic cases, injury is typically the result\nof a traffic or sporting accident, but an increasing number of injuries result from\na low impact fall, for example, in those with osteoporosis.2,3 A non-traumatic SCI\nmay be caused by metastasis, infection and spinal haemorrhage or infarction.3,4 An\nestimated 183 new traumatic SCI occur in The Netherlands per year, of whom 154\nsurvive hospitalization, which corresponds to an incidence of over 10 per 1,000,000\nper year.2 The incidence of non-traumatic SCI is easily underestimated because many\nare not registered as SCI, but this incidence largely exceeds the incidence of traumatic\ninjuries.2,4‑6 As compared to the able-bodied population, the life expectancy of those\nwith SCI is reduced. For example, a 20-year-old man with a traumatic paraplegia has\nan estimated life expectancy of 46 years, whereas an able-bodied man the same age,\nwill have another 58 years to live.3,7 However, because the treatment of complications\nhas improved over the past decades, the life expectancy following SCI has increased.2\nAlthough the life expectancy may have improved, many patients report a low level of\nfunctioning and well-being.8‑10 Functioning following SCI may be threatened because\nmost patients have complications, have a low physical capacity, and depend on others\nfor daily activities.6,9,11,12 Therefore, it is important to investigate opportunities to\noptimize functioning following SCI.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral concussion is a physiological disturbance in the brain that follows a blow on the head. The cardinal symptom is a disturbance in consciousness varying from a complete loss of consciousness to a dazed state. The phenomenon is self-limited and completely reversible. In cerebral contusion there is actual injury to the brain. The symptoms that result vary according to the amount and location of the damage. A very small amount of damage in certain areas of the brain may be fatal, while extensive damage in other areas will be survived. Even when a patient is unconscious after a head injury, certain simple neurologic tests can be done to determine with some accuracy the extent and location of brain damage. When the patient regains consciousness, further bedside tests can be carried out to increase the accuracy of diagnosis. Careful observation of the patient at frequent intervals is necessary to judicious application of appropriate treatment. The physician must be on the alert constantly for signs of intracranial hemorrhage and should be ready to intervene surgically if necessary. In most cases of injury to the head, treatment consists of supplying to the patient elements that are necessary to maintain physiologic conditions and of combating disorders arising from specific injuries to the brain.",

Entrapment neuropathies are characterized by alterations of the nerve function that are caused by mechanical or dynamic compression. It occurs because of anatomic constraints at specific locations including sites where the nerve courses through fibro-osseous or fibromuscular tunnels or penetrates a muscle. For the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies, physicians traditionally relied primarily on clinical findings and electrodiagnostic testing with electromyography.

Attacks of generalized cataplexy produce complete atonic, areflexic partial or complete paralysis of striated muscles commonly involving the leg muscles resulting in collapse of the knees and falling while milder forms often termed partial cataplexy may manifest by sagging of the face, eyelid, or jaw, dysarthria, blurred vision, drooping of the head, weakness of an arm or leg, buckling at the knees, or simply a momentary sensation of weakness that is imperceptible to observers (Guilleminault, 1976; Aldrich, 1993). The duration of cataplexy is usually a few seconds, although severe episodes can last for several minutes and rarely several hours or days in the case of \"status cata-plecticus\" (Parkes et al., 1974; Guilleminault, 1976; Billiard & Cadilhac, 1985; Aldrich, 1992; 1993).This report concerns a 51 year old man with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis who exhibited daily episodes of partial cataplexy which resolved within 3 weeks after he received treatment with picotesla electromagnetic fields.",

      "title": "SENSORY NEURONOPATHIES",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND- Sensory neuronopathies are caused by impairment in the function or disturbance in the structure of the unipolar sensory neurons that reside in the spinal dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. Their vulnerability to pathogenic factors, such as immune effectors, toxins, and infections, may stem from lack of an effective blood-nerve barrier in the dorsal root ganglia. REVIEW SUMMARY- Patients typically present with profound, often asymmetric proprioceptive and vibratory sensory loss with ataxia and variable degrees of pain. Muscle stretch reflexes are absent. Strength is remarkably preserved. The mode of onset may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Supportive electrophysiological features are reduced or absent sensory potentials in the setting of essentially normal motor responses. Recognized causes comprise a paraneoplastic disorder (anti-Hu antibody positive); Sjögren's syndrome; an idiopathic form (probably immune-mediated in most patients); and toxic, nutritional, and infectious disorders. Sural nerve biopsies in patients with sensory neuronopathy show loss of large myelinated fibers. The clinical course is variable, ranging between relentless progression and stabilization with functional recovery. Treatments for the paraneoplastic and immune-mediated disorders comprise corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and various immunosuppressive agents, but they have generally not met with success. CONCLUSION- Sensory neuronopathies are an important group of disorders that may be early warning signals of a systemic illness or disease process such as an occult neoplasm, autoimmune disease, nutritional deficiency, or unrecognized toxic exposure. The differential diagnosis extends across a broad spectrum of conditions that target the distal and peripheral processes of the dorsal root ganglion neuron. Although most sensory neuronopathies have responded poorly to treatment, prompt recognition is important because treatment begun in the earliest stages might stem the further loss of sensory neurons.",

Seu diagnóstico, muitas vezes, é desafio clínico devido aos seus variados padrões de apresentação; por essa razão, pode ser negligenciado não apenas por médicos gerais, mas também em alguns casos por neurologistas. Vários sintomas, incluindo dor de cabeça grave, visão anormal, desmaio ou perda de consciência, fraqueza da face, membros e convulsões podem ocorrer. Embora possa ser apresentada com diferentes sintomas neurológicos, na TVC normalmente não ocorrem alucinações.Relato de CasoUm homem saudável de 59 anos foi internado com queixas de episódios recorrentes de dor de cabeça no último mês e subsequentes alucinações visuais, especificamente prosooometamorfopsia - ele relatou ter visto imagens distorcidas de rostos e objetos. Não foi associado a nenhuma reclamação sensorial ou motora. O exame médico e neurológico geral na admissão estava intacto, incluindo estado mental, exame fundoscópico, nervos cranianos, motor, sensorial, coordenação e reflexos. Ele não tinha meningismo. O exame de sangue revelou uma alteração na proteína C-reativa (9,4 mg/L) e o líquido cefalorraquidiano apresentou apenas pleocitose linfocítica. Realizada a tomografia computadorizada de crânio que mostrou uma lesão cortical hipodensa mal definida na região temporal e occipital direita. A ressonância magnética confirmou a presença de trombose venosa cerebral nos seios sigmoides e transversais. Paciente foi tratado com heparina de baixo peso molecular seguido de varfarina, mas as alucinações visuais permaneceram. Optou-se por iniciar corticosteroide. Após excelente recuperação dos sintomas, em uma investigação mais aprofundada para trombofilias, ele foi considerado positivo para a mutação no gene da protrombina. O paciente assinou o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido e foram utilizados apenas prontuários médicos para a elaboração desse relato.ConclusãoPor essa razão, as ilusões devem ser adicionadas ao já amplo espectro de apresentação clínica da trombose venosa cerebral. Esse diagnóstico pode ser considerado, ainda, em pacientes que apresentam alucinações auditivas e visuais súbitas, particularmente no contexto de cefaleia e com fatores de risco convencionais para trombose venosa cerebral.",

This dizziness almost always occurs either spontaneously or as a result of certain movements or positions.

Some of these impairments are the result of injury to the brain, whereas others reflect the effects of cervical trauma, cranial injury, cranial nerve injury, or cranial-adnexal injury—that is, injury to structures in the head but not the brain itself (Hammond and Masel 2007). Adequate differential diagnosis is crucial to establishing the cause of the sensory complaint and, thereby, directing appropriate clinical management. Well-documented sensory sequelae of TBI include audiovestibular disorders, such as hearing loss, hyperacusis, and tinnitus, as well as disorders of a more vestibular nature, such as dizziness, imbalance complaints, and frank vertigo. Visual complaints are also common following TBI, as well as after cranial trauma and whiplash. Chemosensory complaints involving smell and taste aberrations have also been reported in the literature, with olfactory impairment being a much more common phenomenon than gustatory impairment. Postural instability is another commonly observed sensory disorder following TBI and is generally considered one of the hallmarks of postconcussive impairment. Although this chapter cannot, in the space allotted, address all of the sensory impairments associated with TBI, this review is intended to provide readers with an overview of some of the more critical and/or common clinical issues in this area of post-TBI assessment and care.",

Clinically, cognitive dysfunction can be characterized as debilitation of cognitive dysfunctions, including memory, learning, focus, and speed of mental action. Influencing surgical patients in all age bunches over the short term, cognitive dysfunction shows days or weeks after surgery and shows quicker determination in more youthful populations, in spite of the fact that it might be perpetual. Generally, communicated by patients as another powerlessness to finish once effectively feasible tasks, signs include trouble staying concentrated on an errand, failure to multitask, trouble discovering words and reviewing information recently obtained. In more extreme cases, post-operative cognitive dysfunction can bring about a calamitous loss of cognitive capacity, with related expanded mortality, danger of rashly leaving work, and reliance on social welfare.",

      "abstract": "espanolEl dano cerebral adquirido es una lesion en un cerebro que previamente se habia desarrollado con normalidad. Una de las causas mas habituales suelen ser los traumatismos craneoencefalicos y tienen como consecuencia la perdida de funciones cognitivas, motoras y sensoriales, asi como dificultades en las habilidades comunicativas y en la capacidad para regular las emociones. El caso que se presenta en este trabajo trata de un paciente con un traumatismo craneoencefalico grave, que durante los cuatro primeros anos que siguieron al accidente no recibio ninguna intervencion a nivel neuropsicologico. Se exponen las tecnicas y las herramientas terapeuticas que la rehabilitacion neuropsicologica puede ofrecer para tratar con pacientes que sufren estas dificultades, con el fin ultimo de recuperar las funciones danadas y devolver al individuo el mayor grado posible de autonomia posible y de adaptacion a su entorno. EnglishAcquired brain damage is an injury caused to a brain that had previously had a normal development. Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes, resulting in the loss of cognitive, motor and sensory functions, as well as difficulties in communicative skills and in the ability to regulate emotions. The case presented in this paper is about a patient with severe brain injury, who did not receive any neuropsychological interventions during the first four years after the accident. It will also reveal the techniques and therapeutic tools which the field of neuropsychological rehabilitation can offer to deal with patients who suffer these difficulties, with the ultimate aim of restoring the damaged functions and returning as much autonomy as possible to the individual to adapt to their environment.",

      "abstract": "A Esclerose Lateral Amiotrofica (ELA) e o disturbio dos neuronios motores mais comuns entre os adultos, sendo esta fatal. Caracterizada pela degeneracao progressiva dos neuronios motores superiores e inferiores na medula espinhal, tronco encefalico e encefalo este disturbio leva a inumeros sinais e sintomas clinicos que podem diferir de pessoa para pessoa. Este disturbio, em sua quase totalidade, nao atinge o sistema sensorial e os tratos espinocerebelares tendo estudos que afirmam haver apenas uma baixa atrofia, demielinizacao e degeneracao dos axonios nos neuronios sensoriais. Observa-se tambem que os tratos espinocerebelares sao raramente afetados de alguma maneira tornando estes sistemas quase nao afetados. Estima-se que exercicio seja executado dentro de uma faixa de seguranca e e reduzido ou sessado a depender do estado do paciente. Observa, ainda, que os musculos com diminuicao de forca sao mais predispostos a lesao devido a tentativa, que pode ser ineficaz e muito exaustiva, de movimentacao. O objetivo geral deste trabalho foi descrever a abordagem fisioterapeutica em um caso de um paciente com ELA atendido em uma clinica escola de Fisioterapia do Sertao Central. Trata-se de um relato de caso de assistencia fisioterapeutica a um paciente com Esclerose Lateral Amiotrofica, realizado na Clinica Escola de Fisioterapia – Complexo Luigi Pedrollo, no periodo de 18 de Janeiro de 2018 a 03 de Abril de 2018, onde foi utilizado como fonte de pesquisa bancos de dados como SciELo, Medline e LILACS. Paciente e hipertenso e relata que aproximadamente tres anos comecou claudicar e diminuir a forca dos membros, principalmente inferiores. Achando que podia continuar sem atendimento continuou em domicilio ate perceber o agravamento da situacao e resolveu dirigir-se ao hospital mais proximo. Ao chegar a hospital e apos uma serie de exames foi diagnosticado com ELA. No decorrer do disturbio o paciente foi, ainda, diagnosticado com hernia de disco na regiao lombar. Atualmente o paciente ja se encontra debilitado funcionalmente, pois ja se encontra no estagio 4 da doenca partindo para o 5. Paciente e totalmente dependente do cuidador e nao realiza nenhuma atividade de vida diaria sendo, quase que totalmente, hipotonico. O efeito do tratamento fisioterapeutico para o paciente que e acometido com o disturbio de ELA faz com que retarde o tempo da perda motora que e inevitavel, fazendo com que o paciente fique mais tempo com sua familia tornando sua dependencia mais maleavel. Em relacao ao paciente atendido o tratamento fisioterapeutico levou ao mesmo a um quase que total alivio dos quadros algicos decorrentes da hernia de disco trazendo a uma satisfacao deste. Pode-se perceber tambem uma progressao mais lenta da perda motora e uma maior sensacao de alivio de quaisquer sintomas que o paciente apresentava no inicio do tratamento. Este paciente e qualificado ao atendimento de fisioterapia por tua a sua vida, sendo este logo candidato ao uso de respiradores mecânicos devido sua possivel progressao patologica.",

      "title": "LESI MEDULA SPINALIS",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord lesion is one of major causes of neurological disability due to trauma and non trauma. This disability can cause damage and loss of function below the level of lesion and also has adversed effects on several body systems. Traumatic spinal cord lesion is the most widely reported incidence compared to non traumatic spinal cord lesion. The most leading cause of traumatic spinal cord lesion is motor vehicle crash in children, whereas in old age, falls become the main cause. The mechanism of injury influences the type of spinal cord lesion and the degree of neurological deficit. Spinal cord lesions can be classified into complete and incomplete based on the presence or absence of a function that is maintained below the level of lesion. Complete spinal cord lesion shows absence of voluntary movement or sensation below the level of the lesion on both sides, whereas incomplete lesion shows the persistence of the variation of some functions below the level of lesion. Knowledge on the anatomy of the spinal cord plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis. The level of lesion at the different segments of the spinal cord determines different signs and symptoms, caused by destruction of segmental tissue and disconnection of ascending and descending tracts above and below the level of lesion. The level of lesion is helpful in predicting deficits of body functions that may occur, in determining the next treatment and in predicting the prognosis of the disease. Incomplete spinal cord lesion tends to have a better prognosis. Death usually occurs in lesion with multiple trauma. The leading cause of death is complications due to neurological disability, i.e. pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, septicemia, and renal failure.",

This is different from prolonged coma and conditions in which the brain and brainstem are partially or fully intact and the vital functions of breathing and maintaining blood pressure are preserved. All brainstem function must have irreversibly ceased before brain death testing proceeds. In the overwhelming majority of patients, massive damage to both cerebral hemispheres causes loss of brainstem function. Brain death examination requires a detailed clinical assessment. Ancillary tests are not needed unless the apnea test cannot be performed. Ethical issues may need to be resolved before the family accepts the diagnosis of brain death.",

However, mentally retarded individuals can experience the full range of mental disorders, and the prevalence of other mental disorders is at least three to four times greater in this population than in the general population. In addition, mentally retarded individuals are at greater risk of exploitation and physical/sexual abuse. Adaptive behaviour is always impaired, but in protected social environments where support is available this impairment may not be at all obvious in subjects with mild mental retardation.",

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiological processes resulting in secondary brain damage after brain trauma, partly as a result of the introduction of advanced techniques of neuromonitoring. Early recognition and treatment of the symptoms leading to this type of brain damage seems crucial to the effort to improve the neurological outcome in these patients. Useful modern neuromonitoring techniques include: measurement of the intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressure and continuous electroencephalography. Methods that are also reliable and readily applicable, but less relevant clinically, include cerebral microdialysis of fluid from the extracellular space, determination of the parenchymal oxygen tension, and determination of the venous oxygen saturation. Other techniques that are not clinically applicable include: determination of the cerebral blood flow, the cortical tissue perfusion or the regional cerebral oxygenation.",

Cerebral ischaemia may result from vaso‐vagal syncope or vago‐vagal syncope, the latter being associated with an abrupt fall in blood pressure. Many events may precipitate syncope and convulsions: rectal examinations, micturition syndrome, tussive syncope, ingestion of food and liquids (i.e. the Banquet Syndrome) are some examples. Sudden death may occur due to stress, the causal mechanisms usually involving the cardiovascular system. Cardiac dysrhythmia is frequently implicated. Stress may incude a broad variety of autonomic responses mediated often through the vagal system resulting in syncope, seizures and fatal collapse. The higher nervous system may also modify autonomic electrical activity of the heart with the same consequences.",

A diminuicao da oxigenacao no cerebro denomina-se anoxia podendo evoluir para Encefalopatia Hipoxico-Isquemica (EHI) acometendo principalmente recem-nascidos a termo e pre termo e, em niveis extremos levar a obito. A anoxia neonatal caracteriza uma situacao de diminuicao ou insuficiencia de oxigenacao no sangue que entao nao consegue suprir corretamente as exigencias metabolicas dos orgaos vitais do feto durante o parto. Autores correlacionam a ocorrencia da EHI com alteracoes cognitivas como transtornos de aprendizagem, dislexia e, em alguns casos graves ou severos a paralisia cerebral. Esses autores, no entanto, adotam apenas o diagnostico nosologico, nomeando os efeitos que a anoxia pode causar no funcionamento cerebral, porem sem emitir maiores opinioes sobre as areas cerebrais possivelmente afetadas pela anoxia, identificar a quais zonas cerebrais essas areas pertencem, a acao que esta associada a essas zonas cerebrais e os erros de execucao que, por consequencia, levam as dificuldades de aprendizagem. Essas informacoes permitiriam uma analise interligada entre estruturas e funcoes afetadas, municiando professores, profissionais clinicos e a propria familia nas acoes de suporte ao processo de aprendizagem da crianca. Nessa perspectiva, esse artigo tem como objetivo descrever e correlacionar a acao da anoxia perinatal as dificuldades de aprendizagem numa perspectiva neuropsicologica historico cultural (NHC).

      "abstract": "The resemblance from case to case of certain sequelae to injuries of the head has led to a tendency to group these symptoms together in syndromes and to forget the patient behind them. These syndromes have been variously labeled-postconcussion syndrome, postcontusional state, post-traumatic meningeal headache, post-traumatic circulatory instability and traumatic neurosis—according to the inferred cause, and various rules of thumb have been suggested for their handling. In actual fact, there is no such thing as \"post-traumatic headache\" in the abstract. There are only individual patients complaining after injury to the head of headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, \"nervousness,\" impaired efficiency or other mental symptoms. In view of the fact that few complaints other than these could be made by a person who finds himself in an unsatisfactory situation after such an injury, it is evident that a superficial uniformity of symptoms may cover a variety of physical disorders and disturbances in",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A subclinical EEG seizure occurred in each of 2 patients during a test that repeatedly evoked probable mild cerebral hypoxia. The firing rate of the neurons was unaffected until the EEG seizure had been ongoing for over a minute. After the EEG seizures, all neurons were profoundly depressed regardless of whether their responses to hypoxia had been an increase, decrease, or no change in firing rate. These observations indicate that the mechanism responsible for post‐EEG seizure depression of neuronal firing is probably not cerebral hypoxia. RÉSUMÉ Une crise EEG infraclinique est survenue chez 2 patients au cours d'un test qui provoquait d'une facon répetée une probable et discréte hypoxie cérébale. La fréquence des décharges des neurones n'était pas modifyée pendant que la décharge critique EEG se con‐tinuait pendant plus d'une minute. Après les décharges EEG, tous les neurones étaient trés déprimes indépen‐damment de leur réponse a l'hypoxie, qui pouvait être une diminution, une augmentation ou une absence de modification de la fréquence de décharge. Ces observations indiquent que le mécanisme responsable de la dépression postcritique n'est probablement pas en relation avec une hypoxie cérébrale. RESUMEN Se ha registrado un ataque subclinico en el EEG de dos enfermos en los que se realizó una prueba que repetidamente evocaba una probable y moderada hipoxia. La frecuencia de la descarga neuronal no se modificó hasta que el ataque eléctrico persistió más de un minuto. Después de las descargas eléctricas todas las neuronas mostraron una profunda depresión a pesar de que la respuesta a la hipoxia hubiera producido un aumento, una reducción o ninguna mod‐ificación del ritmo de las descargas. Estas obser‐vaciones indican que el mecanismo responsable de la depresión neuronal que se observa después de las descargas en el EEG, es poco probable que esté re‐lacionado con hipoxia cerebral. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Bei zwei Patienten wurde während eines Tests, der wahrscheinlich wiederholt leichte Hypoxie hervorrief, ein subklinischer Anfall im EEG abgeleitet. Die En‐tladungsrate der Neurone änderte sich erst, als der Anfall im EEG länger als 1 Minute dauerte. Nach dem Anfall zeigte sich eine starke Depression aller Neurone gleichgültig, ob sie auf die Hypoxie in vermehrter, in verminderter oder unveränderter Häufigkeit Entladungen geboten hatten. Diese Beobachtungen zeigen, daβ eine cerebrale Hypoxie wahrscheinlich nicht verantwortlich zu machen ist für die Abnahme der neuronalen Entladungsfrequenz nach einem subklinischen Anfall im EEG.",

      "abstract": "Productive mental disorders (PMD) are the result of pathological mental activity. Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

Deep tendon reflexes are diminished or lost in peripheral neuropathies as a rule. Peripheral neuropathic pain may manifest as spontaneous pain, often in a numb region, or pain and hypersensitivity elicited by a stimulus. There are many sensory symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders, such as their spread beyond the territory of the injured nerve, which could not be explained solely in terms of alterations in peripheral functions. Isolated peripheral nerve lesions tend to occur at the common sites for pressure palsies, and nerves in diabetic subjects are more susceptible to compression injury.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

In this case, dystocia is supposed to be one of the associated events. The neurological deterioration was transient and no neurological deficit was noticed at 7 months after birth. The majority of neonates with large infarcts have a poor prognosis. Early imaging in this population may lead to prompt diagnosis, timely neuroprotection, rehabilitation, and improved outcome.",

A common localization principle is that lesions to the early sensory cortices lead to elementary hallucinations, whereas complex perceptual experiences are related to the pathology of higher‐level cortical regions. We report the case of a patient who experienced complex, non‐stereotyped, multimodal (visual and somatosensory) hallucinations following an acute ischaemic vascular lesion in the right medial occipital lobe. This illustrates that the phenomenology of hallucinations not necessarily reflects the exact localization of cerebral pathology. Instead, the damaged area may serve as a focus of an abnormally activated neuronal network.",

These episodes were either continuous with migraine attacks or interspersed in courses of frequent migraine attacks. EEG recorded during or shortly after the episodes showed frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA). The clinical and EEG changes are both explained as results of spasm of the rostral basilar artery. The episodes of impairment of consciousness are interpreted as migraine attacks with insufficient or missing vasodilatation rebound. The FIRDA pattern in these cases appears to be a sign of ischemia of the rostral basilar artery region analogous to focal slowing in “hemiplegic” migraine which indicates ischemia in other cerebrovascular regions. This view is supported by a simultaneous recording of both types of EEG changes in one patient with “hemiplegic” migraine followed by impairment of consciousness.",

The most frequent cause is stroke, followed by tumor, trauma, anoxia, vascular malformation, or multiple sclerosis. For some causes (and for stroke in particular), AIM can occur immediately after the brain lesion (for example, hemiballism during the acute phase of the stroke (Destée et al., 1990) whereas initial motor deficit may improve or be recovered rapidly. However, in other situations, AIMs (e.g. dystonia) emerge following a long period (a few months or years) of stable motor impairment (Marsden et al., 1985; Scott and Jankovic, 1996). AIMs can also be subdivided into transient (hemiballism, often in the acute phase) and persistent (dystonia, tremor, etc.). Whatever their timescales of appearance or disappearance, AIM may be the main symptom of stroke. This induces a delay in diagnosis or even a lack of knowledge of the specific diagnosis, since for the same underlying cause, the type of AIM can be quite different. This problem is sometimes clinically evident when the AIM is intense (hemiballism) or, in contrast, very moderate and focalized (asterixis). It is clear that a delay in diagnosis may have unhelpful consequences in terms of the patient's clinical and therapeutic management.",

Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is often complicated by an acute and reversible deterioration of mental status, which is associated with increased mortality and is consistent with delirium but can also be revealed by a focal neurologic sign. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities of electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased in biomarkers of brain injury (i.e., neuron-specific enolase, S-100 β-protein) and, frequently, by neuroradiological abnormalities, notably leukoencephalopathy. Its mechanism is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect all brain cells and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown, dysfunction of intracellular metabolism, brain cell death, and brain injuries. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination that can lead one to perform specific neurologic tests. Electroencephalography is required in the presence of seizure; neuroimaging in the presence of seizure, focal neurologic signs or suspicion of cerebral infection; and both when encephalopathy remains unexplained. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if there is any doubt of meningitis. Hepatic, uremic, or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, withdrawal of sedatives or opioids, alcohol withdrawal delirium, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Patient management is based mainly on controlling infection, organ system failure, and metabolic homeostasis, at the same time avoiding neurotoxic drugs.",

Aunque muchos epilepticos mantienen sus capacidades intelectuales y llevan un estilo de vida normal, otros pacientes no son tan afortunados y sufren un impacto directo sobre las funciones cognoscitivas y/o la conducta. La detencion o regresion en el desarrollo, dificultades en el aprendizaje o una marcada fluctuacion en las habilidades cognoscitivas pueden ser los sintomas de presentacion. La disfuncion neuropsicologica en ninos con epilepsia tiene diversas causas interrelacionadas, incluyendo factores organicos, factores relacionados con la enfermedad (etiologia de la epilepsia, edad de inicio, frecuencia y tipo de las crisis, duracion de la enfermedad, las descargas subclinicas epileptiformes) y con el tratamiento. Las funciones cognoscitivas mas afectadas por la epilepsia son: memoria, atencion, funciones ejecutivas y lenguaje.

In the last 3 years of his life, he developed multiple neurological deficits, including bilateral chorea, ataxic gait, sensory neuropathy, and progressive dementia. After death from pneumonia, autopsy examination of the patient's brain was most remarkable for a selective loss of neurons from both subthalamic nuclei and Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum. This pattern of injury is consistent with a toxic process and does not fit previously characterized pathological syndromes known to be associated with movement disorders or dementia or both. Phenytoin has been shown to cause choreiform movements, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive decline in some patients, but the pathological basis for these changes has not been elucidated. The patient's chorea was very likely the result of neuronal loss in the subthalamic nuclei, but causes for his dementia and neuropathy were not found. The pathological findings may represent either an unusual form of chronic phenytoin toxicity or a previously undescribed primary degenerative brain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurometabolic diseases are a group of disorders that lead to a disruption in the normal metabolism within the body and nervous system. Abnormalities of metabolic processes at any level can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical features and pathologies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to metabolic derangements, either inborn or acquired. Early diagnosis can prevent or delay damage to the nervous system through appropriate treatment when possible. Many neurometabolic disorders have poor prognoses, and patients often present and succumb within months to the early years of life; however, some disorders can present later in life with varying levels of severity. In many later onset cases, the diagnosis is preceded by nonspecific symptoms including psychiatric manifestations. In addition to psychiatric manifestations, various neurological features often occur at some point in the course of the disease. Of these features, movement disorders are particularly common. In fact, many neurometabolic diseases will present with subtle movement disorders that are often missed or overlooked. Many congenital metabolic diseases are rapidly neurodegenerative and, due to the nature of such diseases, result in early demise or severe cognitive decline. While by no means exhaustive, this chapter aims to outline and discuss some of the neurometabolic diseases that present with both psychiatric and movement disorders as prominent features.",

      "title": "Neuropathic pain in sports injuries",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain that arises due to damage or dysfunction in the nervous system. Unlike pain caused by tissue damage, neuropathic pain results from nerve issues, which can stem from injuries to the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerves [1]. In athletic activities, athletes may encounter various types of injuries that can lead to neuropathic pain. Sports involving intense physical contact or rapid movements pose the highest risk of causing this type of pain. For instance, spinal cord injuries, which can occur in sports like football or gymnastics, can directly affect spinal nerves and lead to neuropathic pain [2]. On the other hand, sports such as tennis or basketball, which require repetitive movements and continuous pressure on muscles and joints, can damage peripheral nerves and result in neuropathic pain [3]. Additionally, concussions, commonly seen in sports like boxing or football, are another frequent cause of this type of pain [4]. Direct blows to the head can disrupt the functioning of the brain and nerves, leading to symptoms of neuropathic pain. These symptoms may manifest as burning, tingling, numbness, or sudden shooting pain in the affected areas and may sometimes be mistaken for muscle or joint pain. Diagnosing neuropathic pain in athletes can be challenging, as this pain develops gradually and is chronic. For an accurate diagnosis, physicians often use techniques such as nerve conduction studies or imaging scans [5].",

According to their nature the consequences of these injuries may be classified as neurological, psychiatric and esthetic. Various lesions of brain structures cause neurological consequences such as disturbance of motor functions, sensibility, coordination or involuntary movements, speech disturbances and other deviations, as well as epilepsy. Psychiatric consequences include cognitive deficit, emotional disturbances and behavior disturbances. Criminal-legal aspect of traumatic brain injuries and litigation. Criminal-legal aspect of traumatic brain injuries expertise understands the qualification of these injuries as mild, serious and qualified serious body injuries as well as the expertise about the mechanisms of their occurrence. Litigation expertise includes the estimation of pain, fear, diminished, i.e. lost vital activity and disability, esthetic marring, and psychological suffer based on the diminished general vital activity and esthetic marring. Competence and timing of expertise. Evaluation of consequences of traumatic brain injuries should be performed only when it can be positively confirmed that they are permanent, i.e. at least one year after the injury. Expertise of these injuries is interdisciplinary. Among clinical doctors the most competent medical expert is the one who is in charge for diagnostics and injury treatment, with the recommendation to avoid, if possible, the doctor who conducted treatment. For the estimation of general vital activity, the neurological consequences, pain and esthetic marring expertise, the most competent doctors are neurosurgeon and neurologist. Psychological psychiatric consequences and fear expertise have to be performed by the psychiatrist. Specialists of forensic medicine contribute with knowledge of criminal low and legal expertise.",

Electrophysiologically, spinal dorsal horn neurons show enhanced activity to non-noxious and noxious stimuli as well as increased spontaneous activity following spinal cord injury, which often called hyperexcitability or central sensitization. Under hyperexcitable states, spinal neurons lose their ability of discrimination and encoding somatosensory information followed by abnormal somatosensory recognition to non-noxious and noxious stimuli. In the present review, we summarize a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms of neuronal hyperexcitability for treating or preventing central neuropathic pain syndrome following spinal cord injury.",

Sleep attacks were characterized by lid fluttering and closure, upward turning of the eyes, rapid eye movements, myoclonic twitching of all extremities, and loss of consciousness, lasting one or two minutes and aborted by strong sensory stimulation. At their termination, reports of hallucinoid imagery were given. In a sleep record of 6.5 hours, there were 2.2 hours awake (34%), 4.3 hours desynchronized sleep (66%), and a complete absence of synchronized sleep. Reports of hallucinoid imagery were given after awakenings from desynchronized sleep. The findings support the hypotheses that desynchronized sleep is normally under brain stem control and that some types of narcolepsy may be pathophysiologically related to desynchronized sleep.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is underdiagnosed and, in consequence, not properly treated. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. The term dysfunction is not clearly defined and is suggested not used. The prevalence of neuropathic pain is unknown, but a few detailed studies show that neuropathic pain is more common than previously assumed. Some common causes of neuropathic pain are entrapment/injuries to peripheral nerves, painful neuropathies, infections in the nervous system (i.e. postherpetic neuralgia), spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and cerebral infarcts. Evaluation of neuropathic pain is performed on the basis of a thorough clinical examination which includes detailed questioning of different types of pain. Both spontaneous (ongoing and paroxysmal) as well as evoked pain may occur. The ongoing pain may be described by a large number of adjectives such as burning, aching, throbbing, sore, cutting, but there is no pain descriptor which is diagnostic for neuropathic pain. Pain may usually be evoked by lightly touching the skin or by exposure to cold. A clinical neurological examination is necessary in the evaluation of the level of injury, possibly also electromyography/neurography in case of peripheral nerve lesions or CT/MR in case of central lesions. Neuropathic pain is almost always characterised by changes in sensibility, usually involving the thin-fibre system (peripheral nerve fibres or central projections). Special emphasis is put on the examination of sensory dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic twilight state on the one and amnestic episode (transient global amnesia) on the other side are as a rule easy to differentiate from the patient's age, his behavior during the acute state of disease and the kind of its improving. Contrary to other authors' opinion, differentiation is not just possible by diagnosing an injury or its absence. In minor skull traumata preceding the traumatic twilight states injuries are often not manifest and otherwise amnestic episodes occasionnally occur after minor traumata. In a 64 years old woman an obviously typical amnestic episode appeared in direct connection with a probable fall on the back of the head. A 28 years old man underwent a five-hour amnestic episode whereas the EEG showed normal curves. The episode occurred 15 minutes after striking hard upon the ground with the back of the head during a ground roll without following unconsciousness. In both cases traumatic twilight states were not involved. In account of the interval of 15 minutes the trauma of the second case seems not be be the direct cause for the manifestation of amnestic episode. It also shows that the aspect of the disease in the rare occurrence in younger or middle-aged persons is on principle not different from that in old ones. Since a special medical examination during the acute state is only possible as exception the patient's amnestically seizable behaviour obtains greatest importance in differential diagnosis. For the rare coincidence the trauma is given no pathogenetic relevance in amnestic episodes.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "title": "Encefalopatia septyczna a majaczenie stanu ciężkiego",
      "abstract": "ABSTRAKT Wstęp: Encefalopatia septyczna (sepsis-associated encephalo­pathy – SAE) jest ostrym zaburzeniem funkcjonowania ośrodkowego układu nerwowego (OUN), które pojawia się w następstwie infekcji ogólnoustrojowej, jednak bez infekcji samego mózgu. Celem niniejszego opracowania było przedstawienie encefalopatii septycznej jako jednostki chorobowej, z uwzględnieniem danych epidemiologicznych, diagnostycznych i patofizjologii oraz możliwości leczenia.Stan ten charakteryzuje się szerokim spektrum zaburzeń świadomości od majaczenia aż do śpiączki oraz możliwością wystąpienia drgawek czy ogniskowych objawów neurologicznych. U podłoża encefalopatii septycznej leży wiele mechanizmów patofizjologicznych, takich jak zmiany zapalne czy zaburzenia regulacji przepływu mózgowego. Niezwykle istotne są inter­akcje pomiędzy krążącymi cytokinami zapalnymi a acetylocholiną, co prowadzi do zaburzeń przekaźnictwa cholinergicznego i obumierania neuronów. Dodatkowo interakcja pomiędzy acetylocholiną a cytokinami zapalnymi może indukować stan immunosupresji. Rozpoznanie SAE jest ściśle kliniczne, stawiane na podstawie badania neurologicznego i wykluczenia innych przyczyn, ponieważ nie istnieją zdefiniowane testy biochemiczne czy badania obrazowe specyficzne dla tego schorzenia. Zastosowanie metod rozpoznawania majaczenia na oddziałach intensywnej terapii (OIT), takich jak CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit), pozwala na wcześniejsze wykrycie zaburzeń mózgowych. Badania neuroobrazowe (tomografia komputerowa, obrazowanie metodą rezonansu magnetycznego mózgowia), jak również elektroencefalografia mogą być pomocne w ocenie ciężkości zaburzeń. Najważniejszym elementem leczenia jest wczesne rozpoznanie sepsy, zwłaszcza poprzez stosowanie skali QuickSOFA, oraz wczesne wdrożenie wielokierunkowego leczenia sepsy zgodnie z wytycznymi Surviving Sepsis Campaign, co obejmuje przede wszystkim: wczesną identyfikację i kontrolę źródła zakażenia, wdrożenie optymalnej antybiotykoterapii, prowadzenie adekwatnej płynoterapii i podtrzymanie funkcji poszczególnych narządów. Sposobem zapobiegania zaburzeniom OUN na OIT jest unikanie głębokiej sedacji oraz unikanie benzodiazepin na korzyść deksmedetomidyny i propofolu. W postępowaniu farmakologicznym podczas leczenia majaczenia zalecane jest stosowanie typowych (haloperidol) i atypowych (kwetiapina) leków przeciwpsychotycznych. Metody niefarmakologiczne obejmują wczesne uruchomienie pacjentów, zapewnienie cyklu dzień–noc, minimalizację bodźców w godzinach nocnych (światło, dźwięki, interwencje) oraz zaangażowanie rodziny do opieki nad chorym. Podsumowanie: Encefalopatia septyczna jest zaburzeniem obarczonym ciężkimi powikłaniami, takimi jak zwiększona śmiertelność, długoterminowe zaburzenia poznawcze czy postępująca immunosupresja. Wzajemna zależność pomiędzy encefalopatią septyczną a wieloma narządami obwodowymi i układem odpornościowym powinna znaleźć odzwierciedlenie w podejściu do leczenia sepsy.",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

Chronic encephalopathies may be non-progressive, occurring, for example, as a consequence of brain trauma or cerebral hypoxia, or progressive, arising as a result of an intrinsic, extrinsic or metabolic cerebral disorder. The primary focus of this article is the dementia syndromes that result from progressive degenerative disease. However, vascular disease will also briefly be addressed, because vascular dementia is relatively common and is an important cause of dementia. The traditional view of dementia as a global loss of intellect is inaccurate. Cerebral diseases do not affect the brain uniformly, but preferentially affect certain brain regions and spare others. Moreover, psychological processes themselves are regionally organized in specific brain regions. Different cerebral diseases therefore are associated with distinctive and characteristic neuropsychological syndromes, whose identification can",

      "abstract": "The aetiological diagnosis in an infant with hypotonia is a challenging task for a clinician due to variable and long list of differentials [1]. It could be due to an insult within the central nervous system (CNS) or less commonly result from a peripheral defect at neuro-muscular level and other miscellaneous causes (rickets, hypothyroidism) [2]. Most commonly it is a central hypotonia where the muscular weakness is absent or not profound. In Indian scenario, it is mostly idiopathic central hypotonia, followed by HIE (cerebral palsy) [2]. In cases of cerebral palsy, neuro-imaging reveals the severity of affliction. The peripheral aetiologies like congenital myopathies, congenital myasthenia, infantile botulism etc. are rather rare occurrences. Infants with congenital muscular dystrophy have muscular dystrophy, central neural affliction and involvement of multiple systems (skeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, ocular etc.). It is a rare disease with studies in Italian population showing point prevalence of 0.563 per 100,000 total population [3]. Unlike HIE, the affliction in CMD is multi-system and it is an inherited disease with variable penetration, the distinction between the two is important to a clinician for the management. CMDs generally have early fatal outcome. So, early diagnosis is important for prognostication, supportive treatment and genetic counselling. The neuro-imaging findings of CMD clearly stand out from the rest aetiologies and can guide a clinician to go in early , for an invasive test like muscle biopsy which is the gold standard diagnostic test .",

      "abstract": "La encefalopatia neonatal se define como una afeccion que sucede en neonatos nacidos con mas de 35 semanas de gestacion, que cursan con una funcion neurologica alterada.\r\nLa encefalopatia hipoxico-isquemica(EHI), es producida bien por una interrupcion de la irrigacion cerebral o bien por una isquemia en el entorno del parto, que comprometen a las celulas neuronales produciendo lesiones en el encefalo. Este episodio hipoxico-isquemico no se ha conseguido relacionar con una causa clara, ya que se desarrolla a raiz de una serie de eventos precipitados y no predecibles, que hacen imposible su anticipacion.\r\nEn cuanto se produce la lesion, el cuerpo del neonato responde activando una cascada inflamatoria y de reparacion con el objetivo de recobrar la capacidad funcional. No obstante, cuando finaliza esta primera cascada inflamatoria la disfuncion mitocondrial se sigue desarrollando, algo que desembocara, si no se actua sobre ella, en una segunda cascada lesional. Esta segunda etapa tendra lugar entre las 6 y 48 horas posteriores al nacimiento, en la que el cuerpo del neonato liberara celulas y mediadores endogenos que seran los culpables de una nueva lesion neuronal.\r\nLa hipotermia activa consiste en el enfriamiento del neonato a 33o durante 72 horas, de tal manera que se interviene sobre la segunda cascada inflamatoria lesional y por tanto se minimizan los danos cerebrales en el neonato. La hipotermia se debe de iniciar en cuanto se es sabe de que el neonato ha sufrido una lesion cerebral. Algunos autores hablan de la llamada “Gold hour”, la primera hora de vida, donde es muy importante actuar.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic suprascapular nerve neuropathy is a cause of shoulder pain and weakness that is often overlooked. The difficulty in diagnosing the nerve dynamic damages is conditioned by the fact that the symptoms are provoked by physical exertion(s) or a certain position of the limb due to compression and(or) overstretching as well as violations of the longitudinal and transverse sliding of the nerve. These symptoms subside when the provoking factor ceases to act and return when movements repeat. Neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies performed at rest usually show no change. The suprascapular nerve dysfunction is closely related to rotator cuff pathology. The nerve damage is often caused by a dynamic microtrauma during repetitive arm movements over the head with maximum deflection and external rotation of the arm. Suprascapular neuropathy can be caused by the nerve compression or traction in the suprascapular notch or spinoglenoid region. The nerve damage in the suprascapular notch causes weakness in both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, while damage under the spinoglenoid ligament affects only the infraspinatus muscle. Diagnostics should include manual testing of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles with a neutral position of the arm and neck of the patient being examined and during provocative neurodynamic tests of stretching the suprascapular nerve. Therapeutic measures should be directed to all interdependent components of the peripheral nervous system in the following sequence: osteopathic treatment of the nerve trunk interface (tissues surrounding the nerve trunk); osteopathic treatment of the innervated tissue; osteopathic treatment of the connective tissue of the suprascapular nerve.",

      "abstract": "Non-functioning pituitary adenoma may lead to blindness and causes visual impairment in 58% of cases and, more rarely, ocular motor disorder. Patients are slow to become aware of their visual dysfunction, vision in one eye compensating the deficit in the other. Assessment of visual function, comprising visual acuity and visual field evaluation and fundus examination, should be performed regularly according to the severity of impairment. Optic nerve optical coherence tomography (OCT) can quantify optic atrophy reproducibly, and is of prognostic value for postoperative visual recovery. Diplopia most often involves decompensation of heterophoria, visual field fusion being hampered by the visual field defect; such diplopia without ocular motor deficit is known as \"hemifield slide\". Diplopia associated with ocular motor palsy is caused by tumoral invasion of the cavernous sinus (IIIrd, IVth or VIth nerve palsy); in large impairment, restricted eye movement is easily observed; milder palsies require neuro-ophthalmologic assessment and/or Lancaster test. Pituitary apoplexy induces ocular motor impairment in 70% of cases, strongly guiding diagnosis. Visual impairment is associated in 75% of cases. The degree of neuro-ophthalmologic (visual and ocular motor) impairment is one of the main criteria guiding treatment of pituitary apoplexy (conservative medical and/or surgical treatment) and follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

      "abstract": "Terminal decline (or terminal cognitive decline) is the gradual decline in cognitive function that occurs as a function of time before death. The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

      "title": "Brain Injury Impact on the Eye and Vision",
      "abstract": "Public awareness of brain injury has been heightened by two seemingly unrelated factors: brain injury in military personnel during the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and sports-related concussions. The former has resulted in over 340,000 military personnel sustaining a brain injury1 and the latter some 170,000 head injuries per year from sports participation in children age 19 and younger.2 The consequences of even mild traumatic brain (concussion) injury are complex and may include cognitive, memory, emotion, motor, and sensory functions. Visual function is often overlooked in diagnosing brain injury symptoms, as it is not readily visible to the non-ophthalmic clinician with visual symptoms being confused with other symptoms. For example, an individual scoring poorly on (visual) neuropsychological assessments may be labeled as having cognitive problems. This being the case whether or not the cause is cognitive, visual, or both, simply because these were developed as assessments of cognitive function even though many aspects of the test require intact visual function. The frequency of brain injuries in both military and sports arenas also seem different because a different terminology is used to describe the injury. Service personnel are diagnosed with some severity of brain injury whereas athletes are typically diagnosed with concussion. The general consensus is a concussion and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are not different. However, there is little consensus on the use of the term mTBI in sports with some advocating that its use needlessly scares parents or children. Most concussions/mTBI cases do resolve without lasting impact, with the possible exception of increased severity when there are subsequent concussions. Others may argue that using the term concussion understates potential harm and may reduce the likelihood that the individual will receive an assessment to determine if the concussion requires treatment. The current issue of Optometry and Vision Science is exciting, as our contributors provide new information that better informs us about visual consequences of brain injury. Also, in doing so, it improves our overall understanding of the consequences of brain injury. The issue takes a very broad view of the visual ramifications of brain injury and addresses critical topics including assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. The first paper addresses the difference in visual symptoms between military and civilian brain injury. Capo-Aponte and colleagues describe visual dysfunctions in Warfighters who sustained brain injury from either a blast event or non-blast event.3 Although both causal mechanisms resulted in high rates of visual symptoms and dysfunction, the type and rate of visual findings were not different in terms of visual sequelae. This is important because it suggests that what is learned from research into visual deficits from military blast events is applicable to injury from non-blast events that are typical of civilian injuries. Also, of course, what is learned from civilian injuries may be applicable to military injury. Jorkasky and Goodrich expand the link between military and civilian similarities in visual sequelae in an invited perspective.4 They review successful efforts to increase Congressionally directed funding and highlight the roles of advocacy groups, news media, research, and testimony by individuals who have sustained brain injury-related vision loss. They further argue that maintaining and increasing vision research funding will depend upon continuing the efforts of “every voice” to educate Congress on the need for further research funding. The value of such Congressional funding is apparent in that many of the papers contained in this issue would not have been possible without such funding. D’Surney and colleagues report on counterintuitive research findings in the use of erythropoietin (EPO) as a therapeutic agent to protect the retina after blast injury.5 Their results suggest that EPO, at least in mice, may be effective and that delivery of EPO is not time critical. Indeed, EPO may be protective of retinal neurons and axons if intraocular EPO is given 3 weeks post-injury, not at time of injury. Considerable media attention has been given to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly known as CTE. CTE is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to multiple concussive events. Although the untimely deaths of many well-known professional football players have garnered much of the media attention, other sports including boxing, hockey, and wrestling have been linked to CTE. Armstrong and colleagues report that neuronal loss in the superior colliculus may be a consistent feature of CTE.6 Given the role of the superior colliculus in eye movements, their study suggests that eye movement dysfunctions are a possible clinical symptom present in individuals with CTE. If proven to be the case, eye movements may be useful as part of an in vivo screen for CTE. Given the widespread incidence and the variety of possible symptoms after brain injury, there is growing recognition that assessments of visual deficits need tools that can be conducted easily and accurately by health care providers. Laukkanen and colleagues describe the Brain Injury Vision Symptom Survey (BIVSS)—a symptom survey designed to assist health care providers document vision complaints in adults with mild to moderate brain injury.7 The authors report a controlled validation study of the BIVSS. To spur further research and utilization of the instrument, the authors are generously making the survey available at no cost. Taking a different path to assessment of vision deficits after brain injury, Liston and colleagues report on a controlled study using eye-movement testing to detect sensorimotor deficits associated with TBI.8 The test employs randomized, radial tracking tasks that the authors report as providing a sensitive screen useful for quantifying functional impairment, monitoring deterioration or recovery, and evaluating treatment effectiveness. The growing concern about concussions in student athletes has led to the development of widely accepted “return-to-play” criteria. These criteria are useful in guiding parents, coaches, trainers, and others in limiting a player’s return-to-play so as to maximize the body’s ability to heal from a concussive event. “Return-to-learn” criteria, focusing on readiness to return to school after a concussive event, are widely acknowledged as needed. Perhaps because concussions often occur in athletics, criteria to determine if a player can stay in the game and/or safely return to the sport receive greater attention than return-to-learn criteria. The latter criteria concern when a player should return to school; despite evidence linking vision and academic performance, these criteria seldom include vision assessment. Swanson and colleagues report, in a retrospective study, that vision symptoms were commonly reported in children with concussion, as were reports of academic difficulty.9 The authors present a compelling argument that vision assessment should be considered both for children reporting academic difficulty and in future development of return-to-learn criteria. The determination of a vision problem after concussion raises the question of how to treat the problem. Gallaway and colleagues used a case series methodology to address this question.10 Most patients included in their review exhibited vision problems with convergence and accommodative insufficiency being the most common. Treatments provided to address the symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in reducing or eliminating them. The authors state that prospective clinical trials are needed to characterize the natural history of concussion-related vision disorders and treatment. Furthering the treatment of vision problems after concussion, Scheiman and colleagues prospectively studied office-based therapy with home reinforcement in the treatment of convergence insufficiency using change in disparity vergence as a treatment outcome measure.11 The authors suggest that these measures could be used as outcome measures in future randomized trials for treatment of convergence insufficiency. Concussion can occur across all ages; however, diagnosis of concussion in children has not received sufficient attention. Noting this, Weise and her colleagues studied the short-term repeatability of the King-Devick Test in a large group of school-age athletes who received screenings pre-season.12 Their data indicate that the test is applicable to school-age children, although they note that repeat measurement variability became less with increasing age. They also report that the test can be applied for mass screening in a school setting. Of note is their finding that within-subject comparison to their own baseline may provide the best method for making removal-from-play decisions. Furthering our understanding of concussive effects on vision, Storey and her colleagues report a cohort of pediatric patients post-concussion.13 In this cohort, abnormal near point of convergence was found in about one child in four. Of this subset, just under half had clinically normal findings by 4.5 weeks post-injury and most recovered within 11 weeks post-concussion. Over 10% had persistent symptoms and were referred for vision therapy. The authors hypothesize that near point of convergence should be considered in post-concussion examinations as it addresses symptoms that may not be identified through questionnaire screenings. Kulp and colleagues14 evaluated the effectiveness of home-based computer vergence therapy in the treatment of binocular vision disorders in adults who were treated at least 3 months post-brain injury. They assessed a variety of binocular dysfunction measures including fusional vergence, near point of convergence, and vergence facility. After a 12-week, home-based computer vergence therapy regimen, most patients who completed the training experienced meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms. The authors feel their study supports the need for placebo-controlled, clinical trials to determine the best treatment for common binocular vision conditions that occur after brain injury. Photophobia is a common symptom after brain injury; however, the causal physiological mechanism is not well understood. Yuhas and colleagues15 compared pupillary responses to blue and red light in mild traumatic brain injured and control subjects’ pupillary responses to blue and red light. Their results did not support the hypothesis of hypersensitivity to light, but do show greater response variability in subjects with brain injury compared to controls. The study promotes the understanding of the underlying causes of photophobia post-brain injury and contributes to development of treatments based upon objective research. This issue concludes with two important reports that pose interesting questions relevant to research and clinical practice. The first by Houston and Barrett is a review of the existing literature on the effect of patching for double vision.16 They discuss possible effects of this treatment in patients who experience double vision after a brain injury. Patching is commonly used to treat double vision in strabismic patients when prisms are not feasible. The authors found the literature on patching, in cases of neglect and double vision after brain injury, may not be wise because of the interaction of patching and neglect. Houston and Barrett feel the literature supports the use of partial occlusion rather than the use of a patch. Vien and colleagues17 report an interesting case study of an individual with transsynaptic retrograde degeneration of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, they found their 25-year-old patient experienced retinal nerve fiber degeneration over a 2-month time post-brain injury. The timeline Vien found was shorter than expected based on previous clinical observations. They further note that visual field may improve over time; however, the improvement may not correspond to nerve fiber losses noted by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.

In most cases, the cause of epilepsy is multifactorial and the result of both genetic and acquired influences and also of provoking factors. Most cases of epilepsy can be classified according to the predominant cause (or presumed cause) into four categories: 1. Idiopathic epilepsy - which includes the ‘pure’ genetic epilepsies and the epilepsies due to presumed complex genetic mechanisms. 2. Symptomatic epilepsy – which includes cases of predominately genetic or developmental causation and those of predominately acquired causation. The genetic cases include: childhood epilepsy syndromes, progressive myoclonic epilepsies, neurocutaneous syndromes, other single gene disorders, chromosomal disorders of chromosomal function, developmental anomalies of cerebral structure. The acquired causes include: hippocampal sclerosis, perinatal and infantile causes, cerebral trauma, cerebral tumour, cerebral infection, cerebrovascular disorders, cerebral immunological disorders, degenerative disorders and other neurological conditions. 3. Provoked epilepsy – which includes provoking factors and reflect epilepsies. 4. Cryptogenic epilepsy – which includes cases of a presumed symptomatic nature but in which no cause has been identified.",

      "title": "Insomnia in neurological diseases",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

Epilepsy is characterized by recurring episodes in which the electrical activity of many thousands of neurons becomes abnormally elevated and pathologically synchronized. This discharge interrupts normal brain function and leads, in some forms of epilepsy, to alterations in behavior (seizures). Seizures come in many varieties, ranging from brief, barely detectable losses of consciousness in what are called absence or petit mal epilepsies , to uncontrollable tonic‐clonic contractions of large muscle groups in the so‐called grand mal epilepsies .

The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction.

Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival).

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

Epilepsy occurs in 0.5–0.8% of the general population, with 5% of people reporting a seizure at some time in their life. The International League Against Epilepsy proposed a new operational classification for seizures and epilepsies in 2017. Depending on their onset, seizures are classified as focal, generalized, or unknown. Risk factors for seizures are numerous, but could include malformations of cortical development, head trauma, central nervous system infections, family history, complicated febrile convulsions, and possibly history of difficult birth or complicated pregnancy.

The most serious aspect of TBI is that of cognitive impairment as evidenced by animal and clinical studies focusing on synaptic plasticity and memory [2-5]. However, post trauma effects also include communication problems, sensory deficits, emotional and behavioral problems, physical complications and pain, increased suicide risk, and an increased risk for chronic CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [6, 7].",

Proces wiodący do pojawienia się objawów choroby neurodegeneracyjnej rozpoczyna się znacznie wcześniej, zanim się one pojawią. Przebiega często przez wiele lat i bywa bezobjawowy. Pierwsze symptomy pojawiają się gdy znacząca liczba neuronów ulegnie uszkodzeniu, bądź uszkodzenie dotyczy określonej części ośrodkowego układu nerwowego. Jedną z chorób neurodegradacyjnych jest choroba Alzheimera . Dotyczy głównie osób po 65. roku życia i dotyka 5-7% populacji. Czas jej trwania wynosi ok. 8-14 lat. Specyfiką choroby jest stopniowe i nieodwracalne zaburzenie homeostazy organizmu, zaburzenia procesów poznawczych i postępujący zanik pamięci, który prowadzi do zaburzeń orientacji wzrokowo-przestrzennej. Pojawiająca się apraksja skutkuje niemożnością posługiwania się przyborami codziennego użytku. W późnej fazie otępienie jest bardzo nasilone zaś pamięć często ograniczona jedynie do faktów autobiograficznych. Zaburzenia mowy są na tyle zaawansowane, że chory może wypowiadać pojedyncze słowa. Występują również zaburzenia emocjonalne, przejawiające się apatią lub agresywnością. Zaburzenia obejmują również problemy z przeżuwaniem, przełykaniem i kontrolą zwieraczy. Występowanie choroby w strukturze rodziny wywołuje liczne zmiany oraz wyrzeczenia ze strony jej członków.",

La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una condicion neurodegenerativa  caracterizada por deterioro cognitivo, conductual y del funcionamiento global, con un inicio insidioso y curso progresivo que aparece principalmente en la vejez. Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos. A la evaluacion neuropsicologica se observan alteraciones cognitivas importantes en el funcionamiento mnesico ademas del funcionamiento ejecutivo, caracterizados por: una deficiente capacidad de aprendizaje de nueva informacion con respecto a lo esperado para su edad y nivel de escolaridad, una perdida importante de elementos visuales y auditivos a corto y largo plazo, ademas de una significativa presencia de perseveraciones e intrusiones, con un marcado deficit en el automonitoreo. Como apoyo los estudios de neuroimagen muestran disminucion del volumen cortical en regiones temporoparietales bilateral, asi como hipoperfusion asociada a dichas zonas. Con los resultados de la evaluacion neuropsicologica en correlacion con las dificultades en las actividades de la vida diaria, mas los estudios de neuroimagen, se puede apoyar el diagnostico de posible demencia tipo Alzheimer, descartando el de pseudo demencia por depresion.",

Electroneuromyogram is useful for plexic, radicular, nerve, and muscle localizations. Infections and hematologic or solid malignancies are the more frequent differential diagnoses of neurosarcoidosis. Treatments rely on corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive drugs are frequently added because of the protracted course of neurosarcoidosis.

      "title": "Disorders of head-eye coordination.",
      "abstract": "Head-eye coordination subserves the rapid transference of gaze and between gaze shifts stabilizes fixation on stationary or smoothly moving targets. The coordination involves various combinations of the components of head movement, saccadic eye movements and visual and vestibular slow phase eye movement whose fine tuning may be adjusted, to an extent currently debated, by higher order mechanisms. Disorders of head-eye coordination may result in loss of acuity when slow phases are impaired or difficulty with reorientation if there is difficulty with saccades or head movement. Pathophysiology in the brain stem affecting individual components of eye movement may often be identified with success, particularly for the horizontal system, but the organization of other functions, notably pursuit suppression and vertical movements, are little understood. Similarly little is known about the disorders of the overall pattern of coordination--'gaze types'--including the apraxias, which have been attributed to cortical, basal ganglia or even cerebellar dysfunction and are reported in an almost bewildering variety of diseases. The development of coordination in infancy is a rich field in which there have been few studies with adequate observational techniques. The differentiation between congenital disorders whose severity may subsequently wax or wane, variants on normal development and acquired disorders poses a clinical problem which could largely be resolved with adequate recording techniques. For the future there is the tantalizing promise that once the principles of coordination are understood, we can move on to the more intriguing questions of how a certain 'toss of the head' and 'look in the eye' not only transfer gaze but can also be so meaningful.",

A head injury might cause loss of motor control, sensory control, poor balance, and coordination. Cognitive activity, specifical metacognition, is highly affected, causing a lack of self-awareness of actions in patients with persistent long-term symptoms. Head injury in a young adult causes long-term difficulties in learning, memory problems abstract thinking, which causes massive difficulty in their learning performance in the later stage of life. Metacognitive strategy learning and cognitive rehabilitation in the later stage of brain injury improve the learning capabilities and abstract thinking and help them improve their self-awareness and thinking capabilities.

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

Depending on which particular combination of these variables they receive, patients during the immediate postictal period may experience confusion and neurological dysfunction that occasionally progresses to delirium. After the postictal confusion has cleared, two specific types of memory impairment can be demonstrated: retrograde amnesia for events preceding the seizure and anterograde amnesia (rapid forgetting) for events following it. Non-memory cognitive impairments may also be detectable in the interictal period using various modem neuropsychological procedures. Finally, patients may experience subjective memory dysfunction that may or may not be objectively confirmed. Studies of the various aspects of ECT-induced disruption of functioning naturally divide themselves into those conducted during the immediate postictal period before reorientation has occurred, those conducted after full alertness and orientation have been reestablished, and those conducted days, weeks, or months later.",

      "abstract": "Disseminated sclerosis is probably due to an infection of the nervous system.Inflammatory patches in which the myelin sheaths of the nerve fibres are destroyed occur mainly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, including the optic nerves.These patches appear at intervals, a fresh patch leading to new symptoms or to an exacerbation of existing symptoms, while during the earlier phases of healing and scarring the patient improves, often strikingly.The appearance of patches may be so rapid that the patient dies within three months of the first symptom, or the intervals between the outbreaks may be so long that there is no substantial disablemenL at the end of twenity-five years.The nature of the symp- toms and signs depends upon the situation of the patches in the nervous system.A common early symptom is acute unilateral retrobulbar neuritis, which leads to primary optic atrophy characterized by pallor of the optic disk, especially in its temporal half.The brunt of the damage usually falls upon the pyramidal tracts and the cerebellar connexions.The principal manifesta- tions of the disease therefore are weakness of the upper motor neurone type and-incoordination.These find ex- pression in nystagmus, slurred speech, intention tremor, a spastic and ataxic gait, increased tendon reflexes, and bilateral extensor plantar responses.The abdominal reflexes are usually lost at an early stage.Impaired control over the bladder leading to precipitancy or delay in micturition is a common early symptom.Since the cause of the disease is unknown treatment is necessarily empirical, and it is clearly very difficult to judge the value of any method of treatment for a disorder which runs such a variable course.",

      "title": "Awareness Under General Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind.Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death.For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event.In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher.These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness.They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise.EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness.If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

      "abstract": "Focal status epilepticus (FSE) is a condition in which there is an anatomically discrete, continuously discharging epileptic disturbance, lasting more than 1 h (1), that is associated with a definable neurologic behavior. If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

At the same time, some specific epileptic syndromes were indicated by the eponym of the first physician who originally described the condition (e.g., West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome) or by some characteristic clinical features (e.g., nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, absence epilepsy, epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females). In many of these occurrences, the distinct epileptic syndrome was defined mainly by its most relevant clinical feature (e.g., seizure semiology), associated comorbidities, and electroencephalographic patterns.[3] [4]",

More than half of patients suffer from such symptoms in the acute phase of stroke and approximately one in four has long-lasting problems. Knowledge about these symptoms is essential for effective rehabilitation, good information to the patient and his caregivers, and for prognostic purposes.

      "abstract": "Nerve injuries around the shoulder are common. They usually occur as a result of motor vehicle accidents, gunshot or athletic injuries, or overuse and chronic repetitive stress often observed in sports involving repetitive overhead or throwing activities. The mechanisms of nerve injury include direct pressure, repetitive microtrauma, and compression- or stretch-induced ischemia. The severity and extent of compression is related to the degree of the nerve injury. Several nerve injury grading systems have been developed, allowing for the correlation between microscopic changes occurring after the injury and the patient's symptoms; recovery and prognosis is related to the type and severity of the injury. Distinct clinical syndromes involving the shoulder joint area can develop after injuries to the axillary, musculocutaneous, suprascapular, long thoracic, and spinal accessory nerves, as well as the proximal brachial plexus trunks and the lower cervical nerve roots. When a patient complains of pain, weakness, or paresthesia in the absence of known bone, soft tissue, or vascular injury, nerve injury must be suspected. This article summarizes the most common nerve injuries around the shoulder and discusses the classification, mechanism, treatment, and prognosis for these injuries.",

Patients are hypotonic and areflexic from birth, with abnormal facial features and atrophic muscles. Progressive peripheral neuropathy eventually confines them to a wheelchair in the second decade of life, and death occurs by the fourth decade. We here define the neuropathologic features of the disease in autopsy tissues from eight cases. Both developmental and neurodegenerative features were found. Hypoplasia or absence of the major telencephalic commissures and a hypoplasia of corticospinal tracts to half the normal size, were the major neurodevelopmental defects we observed. Despite being a neurodegenerative disease, preservation of brain weight and a conspicuous absence of neuronal or glial cell death were signal features of this disease. Small tumor-like overgrowths of axons, termed axonomas, were found in the central and peripheral nervous system, indicating attempted axonal regeneration. We conclude that the neurodegenerative deficits in HMSN/ACC are primarily caused by an axonopathy superimposed upon abnormal development, affecting peripheral but also central nervous system axons, all ultimately because of a genetic defect in the axonal cotransporter KCC3.",

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras. Tambien mide capacidades constructivas (la habilidad de copiar una figura de Bender), y el uso del lenguaje. La puntuacion total se obtiene sumando los puntos alcanzados en cada tarea y puede ir de 0 a 30(7-9). Una puntuacion entre 27 y 30 puntos se considera normal, de 25 o 26 indica sospecha patologica, de 12 a 24 se considera como deterioro, mientras que una puntuacion de 9 a 12 indica demencia.",

      "title": "A New Treatment for Hypoxic Brain Injury?",
      "abstract": "Hypoxic brain injury is a dreaded complication of anesthesia, surgery, and childbirth. A hypoxic insult activates a series of cellular pathways, resulting in apoptotic and necrotic cellular death. The long-term results often include devastating changes in short-term or working memory. The hippocampus, thought to be important in encoding working memory, is exquisitely sensitive to hypoxic damage. In an article in this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia, Bekker et al. have identified a potential post hoc treatment in a rodent model of hypoxic brain injury (1). The authors have shown that treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine, ameliorates hypoxia-induced performance deterioration on a working memory task in rats (1). Early hypoxia-induced injury is associated with enhanced release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate (2). This insult sets into motion complex cellular physiological pathways that result in deficits in several neurotransmitter systems, including cholinergic transmission (3,4). Defects in cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain may represent a final common pathway for memory defect and dementia. The cholinergic system in the brain includes both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine, which plays a role in cortical arousal, attention to specific sensory stimuli and rejection of irrelevant input (5). Both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are important in cognitive function. Nicotine improves cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. The muscarinic system is also important for cognitive function. High-dose muscarinic antagonists can induce cognitive dysfunction. To make matters more complicated, and yet more promising, there are multiple subtypes of each type of receptor for acetylcholine. The complexity of both systems adds to the promise for specific potential therapies. Highly potent, subtype-selective ligands then have the potential to induce the desired effect with fewer side effects. Diseases associated with dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s-associated dementia have cholinergic deficits that are treated with pro-cholinergic drugs (6). Hopefully, future preclinical studies will be able to identify the specific type of nicotinic or muscarinic receptor that is helpful in the setting of hypoxia, as specific activation might be more beneficial. It would obviously be very desirable to have a treatment that could be used after a hypoxic insult or, prophylactically, in high risk cases. Importantly, in the study by Bekker et al., treatment with physostigmine was effective after the insult, suggesting that treatment could potentially occur after an unexpected injury rather than only prophylactically (1). However, it is important to remember that the authors have not done studies to demonstrate that they are treating a specific cholinergic insult induced by hypoxia. Neurotransmitter concentrations were not measured in this study. It is possible that enhanced activity of either the nicotinic, muscarinic systems or both could overcome deficits in other neurotransmitter systems induced by hypoxia. Less likely, the physostigmine treatment effect could result from changes in other unrelated physiological variables such as hemodynamic control. Nonetheless, these findings in an animal model should be assessed with cautious optimism. Physostigmine is a drug with a long history of human use and a good safety record. However, historically, several treatments for brain injury that have shown promise in preclinical work have failed in clinical trials (7,8). The importance of the problem mandates a continued search for viable treatments to test in clinical trials, including those focused on the cholinergic system.",

      "abstract": "The problem of traumatic brain injury, its consequences in the long term is relevant for neurologists and doctors of related specialties involved in the treatment, diagnosis and rehabilitation of such a contingent of patients. There are about a dozen syndromes; yaks are most common after an injury. However, one of the most frequent and formidable consequences of traumatic brain damage is post-traumatic epilepsy, which is the main identified cause of symptomatic epilepsy at a young age. The work highlights the “trigger” mechanisms of traumatic brain injury, in particular, oxidative stress, which is an essential component both in the early and long-term periods of CNS damage and leads to the disintegration of all its levels, contributes to the development of basic neuropathological syndromes and primarily post-traumatic epilepsy. The problems of interpreting terminology are considered, when the diagnosis is based only on the fact of the presence of a brain injury, differentiation of this kind of symptomatic convulsive syndrome from other epileptic seizures, the dependence of development on the severity of a head injury (severe injury gives an increased risk of seizures 29 times higher than mild), staging and major risk factors for this type of epileptogenesis, as well as disorganization and damage to the antiepileptic system. A spectrum of convulsive seizures is described, in particular partial, taking into account the localization characteristic of a traumatic brain injury with the predominance of its lesion forms. It is necessary to take into account the occurrence of delayed brain damage, in particular disorders of the immune system, the correlation of the course of post-traumatic epilepsy with the degree of development of hydrocephalus, hypoperfusion of brain areas, glial barrier insufficiency, will contribute to the formation of convulsive activity.

      "title": "Generalized Versus Selective Cognitive Impairments Resulting from Brain Damage Sustained in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Children who have sustained focal brain damage frequently have learning problems. It is difficult to determine whether the learning problems are selective, in that they affect only certain domains of cognitive function, or generalized and consistent with restricted intellectual ability. To distinguish between the two types of outcome, the consequences of early damage to the hippocampus and its effects on memory are contrasted with the effects of early hemispheric damage and surgery on speech and language function. That global amnesia results from bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe in adults has been known for nearly 50 years 1. Until recently, however, there were no reports of a similar syndrome resulting from medial temporal pathology incurred in infancy. The earliest injuries that had been reported to produce such an effect were those that occurred at ages 8–10 years 2-4. The absence of cases with injuries earlier than this had led to two possible explanations: (a) damage to the medial temporal lobes very early in life results not in selective memory impairment but in mental retardation because of the widespread effects of such early damage on the development of cognition; or (b) the functional effects of early medial temporal pathology are only transient because of the special plasticity and impressive reorganizational capacity of the immature brain. Both of these explanations have now been challenged by the discovery of several young patients who, in association with hypoxic–ischaemic episodes incurred perinatally or during early childhood, showed severe bilateral hippocampal pathology verified by magnetic resonance imaging, and marked impairments in recall and episodic memory (i.e., memory for everyday events), in the presence of relatively preserved recognition and semantic memory (i.e., memory for factual information) 5, 6. The spared abilities were sufficiently developed to enable these children to attend mainstream schools and to acquire average levels of intelligence, language, and literacy skills. Conversely, the memory impairments, evident on such everyday tasks as remembering routes, appointments, messages, and so on, were sufficiently severe and chronic to preclude independence later in life. To distinguish this unusual pattern of memory function from that commonly seen in adult-onset amnesia, the syndrome has been labeled “developmental amnesia”(Fig.1)6. A: Severely impaired performance of five patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin on a test of episodic memory, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. B: Normal performance of these same five patients on verbal IQ subtests assessing semantic memory. Interestingly, the memory problems of patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin typically become manifest many years after their original insult, as they grow older and are required to become responsible and look after their schedules, belongings, and homework. Furthermore, the patients with pathology of perinatal origin show as great an impairment in recall and in episodic memory as do the patients with onset of damage in middle childhood, suggesting that the increased plasticity associated with a very early age at damage does not overcome the adverse consequences of selective hippocampal pathology on cognitive memory 7. Diagnosis of such selective memory problems early in life is now of critical importance, both to provide the affected children with appropriate remedial help in school and in daily life, and to protect against the adverse socioemotional consequences that memory impairment can impose on the developing child and adult alike. Unlike patients with developmental amnesia who develop low average to average intelligence, language, and literacy skills in the presence of bilateral hippocampal pathology, the majority of patients with focal hemispheric damage leading to hemispherectomy in childhood show a generalized pattern of cognitive impairment, primarily manifested as a dramatic loss of intellectual ability 8. This restriction affects both verbal and nonverbal functions 8, 9. In rare cases where a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal abilities does occur, it almost always favours verbal intelligence, suggesting that verbal functions tend to be rescued and nonverbal functions crowded out as a consequence of early hemispheric damage 9, 10. Against the background of restricted intellectual abilities, levels of language comprehension and expression, reading, spelling, and numeracy are usually in line with expectations derived from the full-scale IQ. This generalized impairment in all aspects of cognitive ability resulting from early pathology is independent of hemispheric side of removal, as outlined below 8. Left hemisphere damage sustained during early childhood, particularly before the age of 4 or 5 years, rarely produces long-lasting aphasia 11-13, provided the homologous areas on the right remain functional. Extensive left hemisphere damage sustained congenitally or perinatally (i.e., before the onset of speech) has not been reported to result in aphasia or even dysphasia, although there may be delays in the development of speech and language. Later in childhood, subtle deficits in the production and comprehension of higher-order aspects of language emerge, but these appear to reflect not difficulties in language, per se, rather the limits set by a general reduction of intellectual abilities after hemispheric dysfunction and removal. With extensive left hemisphere injury acquired before the age of 4 or 5 years but after the onset of speech, aphasic symptoms may result initially, but the symptoms generally resolve before hemispherectomy. Furthermore, there is usually postmorbid development of speech to a point where, as in the patients with congenital or perinatal injury, there is no longer a selective dysphasia 14, 15. Indeed, language production in these patients may actually exceed comprehension ability, which again tends to decline together with the pathology-induced reductions in overall intellectual capacity. When extensive left hemisphere pathology is acquired after the age of 5 or 6 years, a mild version of the adult pattern of aphasia typically emerges. In such cases, speech arrest, transient mutism, anomia, and/or agrammaticism are seen, and these symptoms may become chronic 16-18. Even then, however, speech tends to be a resilient function, with the patient able to communicate effectively through short phrases and sentences. Numerous reports have indicated that, except for temporary interference with speech and language at the onset of a right hemisphere seizure disorder, neither extensive pathology nor removal of this hemisphere impairs linguistic functions selectively 11, 19, 20. Unlike linguistic outcome after left hemispherectomy, outcome after right hemispherectomy appears to be less dependent on the age at initial pathology, there being no reports in the literature of chronic dysphasic symptoms after right hemisphere pathology incurred at any age. Thus, with right hemisphere damage acquired late in childhood, just as with such pathology acquired in adulthood, speech and language functions appear to be unaffected even at the outset of the disorder. With right-sided pathology acquired early but after the onset of speech, there may be some initial linguistic disturbances (e.g., slurring, disorganized, or irrelevant speech) associated presumably with interhemispheric spread of epileptic activity, but these effects ordinarily resolve after hemispherectomy and arrest of seizures. Finally, right-sided, like left-sided pathology of congenital/perinatal onset may result in delayed development of speech and language, but there are no selective deficits. Rather, as with pathology leading to removal of the left hemisphere, damage and subsequent removal on the right at any age has an indirect effect on linguistic function that is related to the lowering of intelligence 8, 15. Because patients with either early-acquired or late-acquired pathology leading to left or right hemispherectomy have had acute-onset seizures, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of seizures, per se, from those of the underlying pathology. The same confounding factor exists in most patients with congenital/perinatal pathology, because such pathology is commonly accompanied by early-onset seizures. There are exceptions, however, and these add support to existing evidence 21 that the seizures, or the associated anticonvulsant treatments, are particularly deleterious to both linguistic and intellectual development. When both the initial pathology and its related seizure disorder commence early in life, then intellectual and, as a consequence, linguistic outcome can be extremely poor. In such cases of early-onset, drug-resistant seizures, the prospects for a favourable intellectual and linguistic outcome are greatly improved by early hemispherectomy, presumably because it minimizes the chance that seizures will further damage or produce chronic dysfunction in the remaining hemisphere, particularly during early development. Late onset of protracted seizures is less deleterious for intellectual ability than early onset, however. For example, patients with middle- to late-childhood onset of epilepsy associated with Rasmussen's encephalitis 22 have better preserved nonverbal intellectual ability in the presence of selective linguistic and verbal intellectual impairments than do those with early-onset seizures 8, 18. This brief overview of the effects of neuropathology on the development of memory and speech and language functions indicates that there are definite limits to rescuing of cognitive functions in the face of early brain damage. Thus, in the domain of cognitive memory, episodic memory is selectively impaired after bilateral hippocampal pathology, even when this pathology is sustained perinatally. In the domain of language function, there is evidence of rescuing of speech and basic communication abilities, but this is often achieved at the cost of nonverbal cognitive functions being “crowded out.” More importantly, early unilateral brain damage leading to hemispherectomy places a heavy cost on intellectual ability, and thus sets limits on the ultimate development of all aspects of cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "A GCS score of 13 or higher generally correlates with a mild brain injury, 9 to 12 is a moderate injury and 8 or less a severe brain injury.Around 80% of all TBI cases are categorized as mild head injuries [4,5].However, many of the patients suffering mild brain injuries are oriented by the time they are first assessed Abstract Objectives: The current study aimed to determine the frequency of neurological manifestations associated with maxillofacial trauma, such as loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia and other symptoms of closed-head injury.Methodology: A retrospective chart review of 75 patients with maxillofacial trauma was conducted.Data was collected on the cause and site of trauma, GCS score, loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia and other symptoms of closed-head injury.Results: Loss of consciousness was reported in 38.7% of patients, the duration of loss of consciousness ranged from less than 30 minutes to over 6 hours.Anterograde amnesia was found in 1.3% of patients.Retrograde amnesia was reported in 18.7% of patients.The duration of retrograde amnesia ranged from 15 minutes to several days, with a mean duration of 15 hours.Headache was reported in 18.7% of patients, dizziness was reported in 14.7% of patients, blurred vision was reported in 8% of patients and nausea and vomiting was experienced by 2.7% of patients following injury. Conclusion:Neurological manifestations are commonly associated with maxillofacial trauma and it is necessary to investigate their presence in patients presenting with maxillofacial trauma in order to initiate proper management and to avoid further complications.",

      "abstract": "L'épilepsie de la face médiale du lobe temporal est un modèle de pathologie neurologique chronique à début précoce s'accompagnant de troubles de la mémoire épisodique fréquents et parfois invalidants. La répétition des crises va entraîner la constitution d'un « réseau » épileptique spécifique à chaque patient sur un plan anatomo-clinique. Ce réseau épileptique pourra par ailleurs interférer avec les réseaux neuronaux physiologiques sous-tendant la mémoire: en les activant directement ou indirectement par levée d'inhibition pendant la crise, d'où la genèse de symptômes épileptiques critiques, comme par exemple un état de rêve ou des fausses reconnaissances; en les inhibant pendant la période critique et surtout post-critique, entraînant l'apparition de symptômes déficitaires comme par exemple l'amnésie critique ou post-critique; en les modulant et en entraînant à terme leur réorganisation. La constatation et l'étude de ces différentes interactions et intrications entre réseaux neuronaux épileptogènes et fonctionnels sous-tendant la mémoire débouchent sur la nécessité d'une part, d'explorer au mieux la mémoire en vue d'une intervention chirurgicale et d'autre part, de mieux appréhender les modifications fonctionnelles induites par la présence d'un réseau épileptogène développé de longue date au sein du lobe temporal. Le but de ces explorations est double : (1) apporter un bénéfice clinique au patient épileptique en terme de prédiction d'une éventuelle aggravation mnésique postopératoire et en terme de rééducation de mémoire; (2) progresser sur le plan physiopathologique sur la connaissance des réseaux physiologiques sous-tendant la mémoire.",

Seizures (altered brain wave [electrophysiological] patterns) present clinically as abnormal consciousness with or without tonic/clonic convulsions (where \"tonic\" = stiffening and \"clonic\" = involuntary rhythmical movements). Neuropathological findings following seizures may be detected using many methods. Neuro-imaging may show a structural abnormality underlying seizures, such as focal cortical dysplasia or hippocampal sclerosis in patients with chronic epilepsy. Neural cell type-specific biomarkers in blood or cerebrospinal fluid may highlight neuronal damage and/or glial reactions but are not specific indicators of seizures while serum electrolyte and glucose imbalances may induce seizures. Gross observations and brain weights generally are unaffected by TAs with seizurogenic potential, but microscopic evaluation may reveal seizure-related neuron death in some brain regions (especially neocortex, hippocampus, and/or cerebellum). Current globally accepted best practices for neural sampling in nonclinical general toxicity studies provide a suitable screen for brain regions that are known sites of electrical disruption and/or display seizure-induced neural damage. Conventional nonclinical studies can afford an indication that a TA has a potential seizure liability (via in-life signs and/or microscopic evidence of neuron necrosis), but confirmation requires measuring brain electrical (electroencephalographic) activity in a nonclinical study.",

Although it may be possible to superimpose images, they are not maintained together over a range. If sensory fusion is disrupted centrally, superimposition of images is unlikely. Central fusion loss is rare, and almost always follows a head injury. A careful history about the injury may contribute to the differential diagnosis.

Due to its location, there are various anatomic structures that might entrap and potentially compress the lingual nerve. These anatomical sites of entrapment are: (a) the partially or completely ossified pterygospinous or pterygoalar ligaments; (b) the large lamina of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process; and (c) the medial fibers of the anterior region of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Due to the connection between these nerve and anatomic structures, a contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscle, for example, might cause a compression of the lingual nerve. Any variations in the course of the lingual nerve can be of clinical significance to surgeons and neurologists because of the significant complications that might occur. To name a few of such complications, lingual nerve entrapment can lead to: (a) numbness, hypoesthesia or even anesthesia of the tongue's mucous glands; (b) anesthesia and loss of taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue; (c) anesthesia of the lingual gums; and (d) pain related to speech articulation disorder.

      "abstract": "Summary Epileptic encephalopathies are conditions in which neurologic deterioration is attributable entirely or partly to epileptic activity. It can be due to very frequent or severe seizures and/or to subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity. The former mainly consists of Dravet syndrome, in which patients have seizures from the middle of the first year of life and repeat episodes of severe febrile status epilepticus and migrating partial epilepsy in infancy, in which from the first trimester of life, partial seizures affect various areas of the cortex randomly and in a subcontinuous fashion. In Rasmussen syndrome, also, epileptic activity contributes at least partly to the neurologic deterioration. Subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity affects newborn infants with suppression bursts, thus consisting in either Ohtahara syndrome or neonatal myoclonic encephalopathy. In infants, it is either myoclonic epilepsy of nonprogressive encephalopathy or West syndrome. In school-age children, it consists of various types of generalized seizures combined with slow spike waves of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, and continuous spike waves in slow sleep combined with various motor or cognitive deficits including negative myoclonus, orofacial dyspraxia, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and frontal lobe syndrome. Treatment differs for all of these syndromes. It is important to avoid potential drug-induced worsening, and valproate is preferred when a definitive diagnosis is not reached in children and especially infants.",

      "title": "Postoperative Delirium",
      "abstract": "NETWORKS are central to life, a fact that becomes strikingly apparent when they become dysfunctional. We have all experienced a sense of frustration when the “net is down” or when trapped in an airport because some critical hub in another city has been debilitated by an unexpected snowstorm. Even seemingly minor disruptions in the transfer of information or people can lead to a surprising degree of disorganization. However, these relatively inconsequential annoyances of modern life pale in comparison with faltering or failing brain networks. Aberrant structural and/or functional connections across the brain account for numerous neurological conditions (such as apraxia or agraphia)1 and have been hypothesized to mediate more complex cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia.2 So why should a clinical anesthesiologist care about a neurologic or psychiatric “disconnection syndrome?” The answer is found in this issue of Anesthesiology, where van Dellen et al.3 present evidence to suggest that postoperative delirium is associated with abnormal patterns of functional and directional connectivity in the brain.Delirium is an acute cognitive disorder, which is typically characterized by a fluctuating course, inattention, disordered thinking, and altered level of consciousness.4 With a reported incidence between 5 and 70% in patients older than 65 yr after various major surgeries,5,6 delirium is arguably the most common neurologic complication of major surgery. Despite this, the pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood.7 Importantly, postoperative delirium is associated with increased morbidity, longer hospital or intensive care unit stay, cognitive decline, quality-of-life decrement, and death.5,8–10 Patients with delirium can be hyperactive and agitated or hypoactive and lethargic. Interestingly, the hypoactive motor subtype is more common, is often undiagnosed, and has been associated with worse outcomes.11 In short, delirium is a pathophysiologically obscure, underdiagnosed, common, and serious neurological complication of surgery. The field of anesthesiology should therefore prioritize its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, while concurrently investigating its underlying mechanisms.In the current study, van Dellen et al. conducted a postoperative assessment of patients aged 50 yr or older undergoing cardiac surgery who had no history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. Mental status was evaluated during a 5-day period after surgery (or after emerging from postoperative coma) using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit, a validated instrument for diagnosing delirium in intubated intensive care unit patients.12 In addition, 21-channel electroencephalography was recorded in the postoperative period and later analyzed for functional connectivity, directional connectivity, and various network features (table 1). Clinical characteristics and connectivity and network measures were compared between patients with delirium and a matched cohort without delirium. The investigators found that, not surprisingly, patients with delirium (n = 25) were sicker and had longer surgical times compared with patients without delirium (n = 24). However, even controlling for these factors, there was a reduction of functional connectivity in the α bandwidth (8 to 13 Hz) and increased directional connectivity from central to anterior regions in the δ bandwidth (0.5 to 4 Hz). Furthermore, a number of network properties (such as path length and clustering coefficient) were abnormal in patients who experienced delirium. The authors concluded that functional brain networks are less connected in association with postoperative delirium, suggesting that mechanistically it may be classified as a disconnection syndrome.Before interpreting these results, it will be beneficial to consider some methodological points. There are four types of “connectivity” that are often measured in the brain: (1) structural, defined as the anatomic connections between brain regions, (2) functional, defined as the statistical covariations between the activity of brain regions, (3) directional, defined as coupled activity in which one brain region leads and another follows or lags (without, necessarily, having a causal influence), and (4) effective, defined as a causal relationship in which one brain region is influencing the activity of another. One well-known problem with measures of functional connectivity using electroencephalography is volume conduction. If the same source of activity is detected at two different electrodes, that activity artificially appears to be synchronized or coherent because it is merely common to both electrodes. To avoid this problem, Stam13 (an author of the current study) and colleagues previously introduced phase lag index (PLI) as a measure of functional connectivity. PLI attempts to bypass the volume conduction problem by not “counting” zero-lag correlations (which, because there is no phase difference, could potentially come from the same source). Instead, PLI assesses consistent, nonzero phase lead–lag relationships that presumably reflect a functional connection between two sources of activity. Unlike this snapshot measure of instantaneous phase relationship, directed PLI (dPLI) is a measure of directional connectivity that assesses lead–lag relationships over time. dPLI has been studied in a neuroanatomically informed brain model and shows a tendency of α rhythm “flow” from anterior to posterior brain structures in the resting state,14 which has been confirmed empirically in human volunteers.15van Dellen et al. used PLI and dPLI in the current study. This means that their results regarding functional connectivity might be less likely to reflect volume conduction and also means that the findings may reflect longer-range connections in the brain (which would tend to have nonzero lag relationships). Of note, Lee et al. previously studied PLI and dPLI after induction with propofol, finding reduced PLI in the α bandwidth (8 to 13 Hz) during and after the period of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Furthermore, the abnormal dPLI may reflect changes in the topology of the network, as has also been suggested by the study of dPLI and propofol (although in the α rather than δ bandwidth).15 In light of the current findings, it might be speculated that postoperative delirium reflects a failed recovery—or perhaps a fragile recovery—of functional connectivity, as manifested in the α bandwidth. This functional “disconnection” could prevent individual subsystems in the brain from properly interacting and integrating information, resulting in the cognitive deficits characteristic of delirium. Furthermore, electroencephalographic measures of connectivity may have diagnostic potential, especially in the case of hypoactive delirium when the phenotype is not clinically obvious.There are a number of important points to consider before including postoperative delirium in the class of disconnection syndromes. First, a prior study of functional magnetic resonance imaging and delirium demonstrated an increase in functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, with decreases between cortical and subcortical structures.16 These data need to be reconciled with the electroencephalographic study by van Dellen et al., who found reduced corticocortical connectivity. Second, the differences in functional connectivity between the cohorts with and without delirium were small (PLI of 0.119 vs. 0.139). It is unclear what clinical meaning these statistically significant differences have in relation to overall network function, or whether they could be explained by more mundane reasons related to the processing of the electroencephalographic data. Third, unlike the past study of functional magnetic resonance imaging, this was not a within-subjects study design. In other words, we do not have data on individual subjects in periods of both lucidity and cognitive dysfunction and therefore cannot distinguish if the changes in functional connectivity are associated with delirium or some other brain property of these generally sicker patients. Finally, delirium has a complex etiology, so any potential relationship between the cognitive disconnections during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness15,17 and those of the postoperative period is merely speculative.Despite these limitations, it should be noted that the work by van Dellen et al. is the first to probe the electroencephalogram of patients with postoperative delirium beyond its spectral properties, pointing to the potential for functional disconnections and network abnormalities as the mechanism for disrupted cognition. Further work is required to reconcile these results with past investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging and to establish robust connectivity measures that might reveal when the network is down.The authors are not supported by, nor maintain any financial interest in, any commercial activity that may be associated with the topic of this article.",

      "abstract": "Memory loss commonly occurs as a result of the loss of nerve cells in the brain. When memory loss is so severe that it interferes with normal daily functioning, it is called dementia. People with dementia may have difficulty learning new things or remembering names of people they just met. They may get lost in places that were previously very familiar or have trouble finding words. The term “mild cognitive impairment” is used for a common condition in elderly people in which the memory problem is usually mild and does not interfere with normal daily activities. Most people with mild cognitive impairment do not develop a severe memory problem or end up developing dementia. There are many things that can cause dementia. One of these is Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Another is called vascular dementia, caused by brain damage due to strokes. More information about causes of dementia can be found on the next page.\n\nIn this issue of Neurology , O’Brien and colleagues report the results of a study in elderly people evaluating the risk of developing dementia after a person has had a stroke (Gamaldo A, Moghekar A, Kilada S, Resnick SM, Zonderman AB, O’Brien R.

The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

This complication not only compromises recovery after surgery, but, if persistent, it minimizes and compromises surgery itself. Risk factors of postoperative cognitive disorders can be divided into age and comorbidity dependent, and those related to anesthesia and surgery. Cardiovascular, orthopedic and urologic surgery carries high risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. It can also occur in other types of surgical treatment, especially in elderly. Among risk factors of cognitive disorders, associated with comorbidity, underlying psychiatric and neurological disorders, substance abuse and conditions with elevation of intracranial pressure are in the first place in postoperative patients. Preoperative and perioperative predisposing conditions for cognitive dysfunction and their incidence were described in our paper. These are: geriatric patients, patients with substance abuse, preexisting psychiatric or cognitive disorders, neurologic disease with high intracranial pressure, cerebrovascular insufficiency, epilepsia, preeclampsia, acute intermittent porphyria, operation type, brain hypoxia, changes in blood glucose level, electrolyte imbalance, anesthetic agents, adjuvant medication and intraoperative awareness.

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease must be considered in all subjects over 40 years of age whose mental functions have insidiously become altered and are progressively getting worse. The initial phase of the disease, which precedes dementia, is characterized by disorders of memory often associated with changes in personality and behaviour and with subtle disorders of speech, reasoning and abstraction ability and visuo-constructive capabilities. The results of neurological and paraclinical examinations are normal. This phase lasts from two to four years and may be diagnosed as \"possible Alzheimer's disease\". When the disease is established the patient has lost his autonomy and can only be kept at home with the help of his relatives. Dementia gradually becomes worse, with a combination of memory disturbance, aphasia-apraxia-agnosia syndrome, impaired intellectual faculties and disorders of behaviour. Computerized tomography shows evidence of cerebral atrophy. This phase lasts from three to six years and may be called \"probable Alzheimer's disease\". The terminal phase of the disease includes somatic lesions, and all mental functions are profoundly altered. Death occurs seven to ten years after the first symptoms. Histopathological data are necessary to make a diagnosis of \"confirmed Alzheimer's disease\", since there is no clinical, morphological, electrophysiological or radiological sign that is pathognomonic of that disease.",

      "title": "The Connection between Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Therapeutic Approaches",
      "abstract": "A Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by an external force (vehicle, accidents, violence, sports injuries, industrial accidents, falls). Brain trauma can occur either from an object penetrating the skull or from rapid acceleration (speeding up), or deceleration (slowing down or stopping suddenly) of the brain. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and disability, especially in children and young adults. Based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the neurological scale used to measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury, traumatic brain injury is classified as: mild (GCS 13 - 15), moderate (GCS 9 - 12), severe (GCS 8 or less), and evaluates the following functions: Eye Opening (E), Motor Response (M), and Verbal Response (V), to determine a patient's overall GCS, add together the scores from eye opening, motor response and verbal response. Scores range from 3 to 15. A score of 8 or less signifies coma. Symptoms can vary depending on the severity of the head injury. An individual with a mild traumatic brain injury can remain conscious, or may experience a loss of consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms may include headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, ringing in the ears or changes in hearing, fatigue or lethargy, a change in sleep patterns, behavioral or mood changes, and cognitive and/or executive functioning problems. People with a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury may show the same symptoms, but may also have a headache that gets worse, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, an inability to awaken from sleep, dilation of one or both pupils of the eyes, slurred speech, weakness or numbness in the extremities, loss of coordination, and increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the most common neurobehavioral consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), occurring in 20% to 50% of individual's post-injury (Irastorza, 2011). Some of the most persistent problems include impairment in memory, attention and concentration, language, executive skills, social judgment, social behavior, and impulsiveness. Previous studies have shown that Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of mental health problems and increases the risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Schachar et al., 2015). According to studies (Ilie et al., 2015), physical brain injury contributes to the development of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Because the risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder development after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains high over an extended period, and some of the most persistent problems include impairment in memory, attention and concentration, language, executive skills, social judgment, social behavior, and impulsiveness; this master thesis shows the importance of an early prompt intervention after brain injury, and the need to establish a therapeutic plan in order to treat the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder development and evolution. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the association between Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and also to show the importance of prompt intervention and preventive therapy in order to stop the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder development and evolution.",

      "abstract": "Motor weakness in a patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) may be related to (1) pre-existing neuromuscular disorder that leads to ICU admission, (2) new-onset or previously undiagnosed neurological disorder, or (3) complications of non-neuromuscular critical illness. Neuromuscular syndromes related to ICU treatment consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and are now recognized as a frequent cause of newly acquired weakness in ICU patients. Clinical features include quadriparesis, muscle wasting, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Evaluation of these patients is based on knowledge of clinical setting and predisposing factors, focused neurological examination, detailed electrophysiological investigation, serum creatine kinase level, other laboratory studies as needed, and histological examination of muscle biopsy. If a central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) lesion is suspected, neuroimaging studies are required. In addition to conventional nerve conduction and needle electromyography, phrenic nerve conduction, diaphragm electromyography, blink reflex, and (recently) the technique of direct muscle stimulation have been employed. Critical illness polyneuropathy is an axonal motor and sensory neuropathy that often follows sepsis and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for critical illness myopathy are corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking drugs, acute respiratory illness, and organ transplant. Three subtypes (acute necrotizing myopathy, thick myosin filament loss myopathy, and type II fiber atrophy) are recognized. Major differential diagnoses of critical illness related paralysis are incidental Guillain-Barré syndrome and unmasked myasthenia gravis. Rarely, atypical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polymyositis or other myopathies, and precipitation of porphyria or rhabdomyolysis due to drugs used in the ICU have been described. Recently a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis due to West Nile virus infection was reported. A subgroup of patients with myasthenia gravis with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody is noted to present as respiratory crisis. Muscle biopsy in ICU paralysis syndromes may be helpful in arriving at a specific diagnosis or to classify the type of critical illness myopathy. Nerve biopsy is only rarely indicated.",

      "abstract": "Spasticity is part of the upper motor neuron syndrome produced by conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy that affect upper motor neurons or their efferent pathways in the brain or spinal cord. It is characterized by increased muscle tone, exaggerated tendon reflexes, repetitive stretch reflex discharges (clonus) and abnormal spastic posturing. Late sequelae may include contracture, pain, fibrosis and muscle atrophy. The most common pattern of spasticity in the upper limb involves flexion of the fingers, wrist and elbow, adduction with internal rotation at the shoulder and sometimes thumb curling across the palm or fist. The most common pattern of spasticity in the lower limb involves extension at the knee, plantarflexion at the ankle and sometimes inversion of the foot.",

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

      "title": "Aplicación de tecnologías asistenciales para el aumento de la capacidad de comunicación en personas afectadas de trastorno neuromotor",
      "abstract": "La presente Tesis Doctoral describe una serie de desarrollos de Tecnologia Asistencial enfocados al fomento de la comunicacion de personas afectadas por trastorno neuromotor, en particular de aquellas con afectacion fisica muy severa. El trastorno neuromotor no es una enfermedad, sino un compendio de todas las lesiones cerebrales que afectan a la movilidad y a la postura de las personas, siendo la Paralisis Cerebral (PC) la patologia de mayor incidencia. Una de las caracteristicas del trastorno neuromotor es que una afectacion persistente y no progresiva surgida por un dano o una malformacion del cerebro en el momento del embarazo (trastorno congenito) o bien por una lesion del mismo (trastorno adquirido) producida por infecciones del sistema nervioso central, accidentes, etc. Por anadidura, estos desordenes psicomotrices suelen estar frecuentemente acompanados de trastornos sensitivos, cognitivos, del lenguaje, perceptivos, de conducta, y / o epilepsia. Es evidente que la psicomotricidad esta intimamente relacionada con la comunicacion (en sentido integral, la transmision de un mensaje que sea entendido por el receptor, ya sea este un humano o una maquina), puesto que en ella hay una serie de musculos implicados que se ven afectados. Cuando el acto de transmision se ve entorpecido por las manifestaciones clinicas del trastorno neuromotor, la calidad de la emision disminuye y por lo tanto es mas improbable que el receptor entienda el mensaje, cayendo el emisor (la persona afectada de trastorno neuromotor) en una reclusion social. Afrontar este problema de la incomunicacion en la que se encuentran muchos de los afectados por la paralisis cerebral y por las demas patologias englobadas dentro del termino “trastorno neuromotor” es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrentan diariamente tanto los afectados como sus familiares. La ingenieria permite el uso de tecnologia por parte de las personas con necesidades especiales, las cuales mejoraran sin duda alguna su vida diaria. Pero la tecnologia ha de introducirse con la premisa fundamental de que ha de ser accesible, tanto en terminos de diseno de sus interfaces de usuario (hardware y software) como en terminos de coste de adquisicion, operacion y mantenimiento. De todos los desarrollos tecnologicos posibles, esta Tesis Doctoral se centra en aquellos destinados a paliar las manifestaciones fisicas del trastorno neuromotor, las cuales pueden ser muy variadas: distonia (contracciones involuntarias de los musculos), espasticidad (contraccion permanente de algunos musculos), movimientos atetosicos (movimientos lentos y sinuosos)… Estas manifestaciones son de indole cualitativo, siendo complejo realizar una baremacion de las mismas, por lo que se realizan desarrollos diferenciados segun la severidad de la afectacion motora en los usuarios. En aquellos usuarios en los que la afectacion motora de las extremidades de los miembros superiores es moderada, los dispositivos moviles se erigen como la alternativa mas accesible para los usuarios desde el punto de vista de la accesibilidad, entendida esta tanto como la facilidad de operacion como la posibilidad de adquisicion por una amplia variedad de economias familiares. En particular, el SO Android sera el seleccionado por su amplia cuota de mercado y su orientacion Open Source para el diseno e implementacion de Sistemas Alternativos y Aumentativos de Comunicacion (SAAC) que aprovechen tanto las formas de interaccion de las pantallas tactiles como la conexion de pulsadores adaptados, asi como la potencia de las bases de datos SQLite para la creacion y gestion de tableros de comunicacion basados en el uso de pictogramas. En el caso de una mayor severidad de la afectacion del trastorno neuromotor sobre las extremidades, la falta de perifericos externos de los dispositivos moviles (principalmente por la juventud de estos) desaconseja su uso en beneficio de ordenadores personales, y en particular, la implementacion de ratones virtuales que permitan a los usuarios la comunicacion a traves de pictogramas o de teclados virtuales. Puesto que dentro de la severidad de las manifestaciones clinicas, cada afectado presenta deficiencias motrices muy diferentes, los gestos que se han de poder capturar para operar estos ratones virtuales han de ser variados. Los desarrollos software han de ser por tanto transparentes a estos metodos de entrada, ya sean estos gestos basados en movimientos oculares, movimientos cefalicos u otro tipo de senales biomedicas tales como ondas electroencefalograficas (EEG) o Electromiografia (EMG), metodos de entrada todos ellos contemplados en los desarrollos aqui descritos. Se describira el desarrollo de SAAC basados en la interpretacion de gestos, adecuados para afectaciones severas, como aquellos basados en la interpretacion de la actividad cerebral mediante dispositivos procedentes del mundo de los videojuegos, adecuados para aquellas afectaciones que imposibiliten de manera completa la operacion de cualquier otro metodo de seleccion y accesibles por una amplia variedad de economias familiares. Fomentar la capacidad de comunicacion entre personas no es sino el primer objetivo de los trabajos que aqui se describiran. El ser humano ha de ser capaz no solo de desenvolverse en un medio social, sino tambien de interactuar con su entorno mas inmediato. No es el objetivo de estos trabajos la generacion de tecnologia o de adaptaciones destinadas a la mejora de la autonomia personal (tales como ortesis robotizadas, sillas de ruedas electricas o exoesqueletos), es decir, la promocion de la participacion de las personas en las Actividades de la Vida Diaria (AVD), sino que el campo de investigacion se limitara a la comunicacion entre humanos y en particular, a la promocion de las habilidades sociales que se fundamentan en la edad infantil y primaria, edades que coinciden con la etapa de mayor plasticidad cerebral y generacion de sinapsis neuronales. El fomento de la capacidad de comunicacion sera empleado por tanto para la promocion del uso de estas herramientas de Tecnologia Asistencial generadas en un entorno educativo, de modo que las nuevas capacidades desarrolladas puedan ser utilizadas para la realizacion de actividades de entrenamiento cerebral que refuercen esta reestructuracion de las conexiones neuronales. Los resultados obtenidos muestran que es posible el manejo de interfaces de accesos a dispositivos por parte de personas distonicas, pero que es necesario un entrenamiento fuerte. Asi mismo, se describira como una exhaustiva y metodologica recopilacion de requisitos de los usuarios, incluyendo en este concepto tanto a las personas afectadas de trastorno neuromotor como a sus cuidadores formales e informales, conduce a la creacion de herramientas tecnologicas capaces de ser empleadas fuera de los entornos de grupos de investigacion y por lo tanto, capaces de ser operadas y mantenidas sin la intervencion de tecnicos cualificados en instrumentacion y en la interpretacion y adquisicion de senales. Finalmente, se esbozaran lineas futuras de desarrollo que sobrepasen la “simple comunicacion” con humanos, permitiendo la comunicacion con todo tipo de maquinas y abriendo un abanico de mejoras en la autonomia de la vida de las personas que va desde el control de la domotica, al control de sillas de ruedas, ortesis robotizadas o la realizacion de terapias de rehabilitacion cognitivas y/o fisicas.",

They can be observed both in the acute stage, and frequently the deficits remain long past the point in which a total physical recovery has taken place. Insome cases, skills have to be retaught and alternative strategies given, and the child’s behaviour may need modifying.

These include aphasia (dominant hemisphere), memory loss (hippocampal involvement), and poststroke depression (left hemisphere more likely than right; anterior more likely than posterior). Changes in global, nonfocal psychological categories, such as self-identity and personality, are not typically observed or addressed in the stroke's early stages. However, an analysis of medically naive discourse about stroke suggests that patients and observers conceptualize and internalize three important, long-term psychological sequelae of stroke: (1) the dehumanization of the patient, (2) the onset of senescence, and (3) the decline of intelligence. These psychological sequelae represent changes in the otherwise more enduring features of psychological structure. They are part of the disease burden of stroke and need to be addressed in long-term rehabilitation programs.",

Acute alcohol poisoning is too familiar to warrant further discussion, and its consequences as they affect the nervous system, are well known.

Alcohol itself is unlikely to be the responsible toxin, for improvement of the neuropathy can occur by restoration of normal diet despite continued drinking. Fits are a symptom of an abnormal cerebral cortex, so can be caused by many of the consequences of alcoholism. A small proportion of alcoholics develop bilateral progressive visual impairment, associated with characteristic central or centro-caecal scotoma and optic atrophy.

      "title": "Chronic Refractory Insomnia in a Patient With Undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder and Long-Standing Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a form of acquired brain injury, occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. TBI can result when the head suddenly and violently hits an object or when an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue. TBI can be classified into primary and secondary brain injury. Primary injury refers to the structural damage caused upon impact. Secondary injury refers to the damage from subsequent cellular processes following a prior injury, such as excitotoxicity, free radical generation, calcium-mediated damage, hypoxia, and increased intracranial pressure. Unsurprisingly, these mechanisms can produce structural, biochemical, and genetic changes implicated in sleep disturbance. A coup-contrecoup injury typically occurs at the base of the skull in areas of bony prominences, hence, the anterior temporal and inferior frontal regions, including the basal forebrain, are frequently injured. Because the basal forebrain contributes to sleep initiation, injury to this region can lead to insomnia symptoms. In this report, we present a case study of a 41-year-old Caucasian male who experienced a TBI at the age of seven due to a motor vehicle accident. The left frontotemporal lobe was affected as a result of the incident. He was admitted to the emergency room in March 2023 for safety concerns in the context of extreme anger and irritability, which could endanger others and himself. Additionally, he struggled with chronic insomnia. The chart review showed that the patient's chronic insomnia was poorly controlled and probably contributed to the current presentation. The patient was observed in the days following admission while various medication changes were attempted to treat his chronic insomnia. Unique limitations were encountered in managing this patient's insomnia, as he has multiple drug allergies, including some of the commonly used medications to treat insomnia. A particularly unique observation was that the medications that finally worked for this patient had anticholinergic side effects. They are usually contraindicated in post-TBI patients. However, it was beneficial to use them in this case, which can be explored further.",

      "title": "The Pathophysiology of Concussion",
      "abstract": "Abstract Concussion is defined as a biomechanically induced brain injury characterized by the absence of gross anatomic lesions. Early and late clinical symptoms, including impairments of memory and attention, headache, and alteration of mental status, are the result of neuronal dysfunction mostly caused by functional rather than structural abnormalities. The mechanical insult initiates a complex cascade of metabolic events leading to perturbation of delicate neuronal homeostatic balances. Starting from neurotoxicity, energetic metabolism disturbance caused by the initial mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be the main biochemical explanation for most postconcussive signs and symptoms. Furthermore, concussed cells enter a peculiar state of vulnerability, and if a second concussion is sustained while they are in this state, they may be irreversibly damaged by the occurrence of swelling. This condition of concussion‐induced brain vulnerability is the basic pathophysiology of the second impact syndrome. N ‐acetylaspartate, a brain‐specific compound representative of neuronal metabolic wellness, is proving a valid surrogate marker of the post‐traumatic biochemical damage, and its utility in monitoring the recovery of the aforementioned “functional” disturbance as a concussion marker is emerging, because it is easily detectable through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",

Mittels standardisierter neuropsychologischer Verfahren wird eine differenzierte Abklärung über Art und Ausmaß von kognitiven Funktionsstörungen, insbesondere von Gedächtnisstörungen, Aphasie, Apraxie, Agnosie und Störungen der exekutiven Funktionen durchgeführt. In Patienten mit Alzheimerkrankheit (AD) sind oft episodische und semantische Gedächtnisleistungen und bestimmte Sprachfunktionen bereits im Frühstadium betroffen. Apraktische und agnostische Störungen werden häufig erst im späteren Verlauf beobachtet. Patienten mit einer vaskulären Demenz werden je nach Läsionsart und -ort neben den Gedächtnisstörungen eher hemisphärisch-lateralisierte Befunde (mit z.B. aphasischen, apraktischen oder räumlich-konstruktiven Störungen) aufweisen. In verschiedenen Demenzformen aus dem frontotemporalen Kreis sind in erster Linie die exekutiven Funktionen und/oder die Persönlichkeit betroffen.",

The clinical presentation of peripheral neuropathy includes sensory impairments such as numbness, tingling, burning pain, and hypersensitivity, predominantly affecting the distal extremities. Motor impairments, including weakness, muscle atrophy, and impaired coordination, may also occur, which causes activity limitations and participation restrictions. Additionally, autonomic dysfunction causes further complications such as gastrointestinal disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, and urinary retention. These symptoms can range from mild to severe pain and disability, ultimately impacting the quality of life of the suffering individuals.

Coma is a severe state of cerebral dysfunction resulting from either structural, chemical, electric, or toxic disorders of the brain. Coma is potentially reversible and life threatening and should be treated as a medical emergency. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is often used to describe a person's level of consciousness after injury or medical event. Brain death is the determination of death by neurological criteria. Components of the brain death determination process include a clinical exam documenting the complete absence of all brain stem reflexes and an apea test documenting absent respirations in the setting of hypercarbia. The emotional and psychosocial impact of death is always stressful for those who survive the patient; this can be even more difficult in the setting of brain death.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

However, delayed neurological complications caused by low-voltage electric shock are rarely reported. Here, a case of a man suffering from weakness and aphasia due to the delayed-onset of the peripheral nerve injury and ischemic stroke following an electrical shock is presented. Possible mechanisms underlying the neurological complications include thermal injury to perineural tissue, overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, vascular injury, and histological or electrophysiological changes. Moreover, vasospasms caused by low-voltage alternating current may predispose individuals to ischemic stroke. Therefore, clinicians should consider the possibility of neurological complications, even if the onset of the symptoms is delayed, and should perform diagnostic tests, such as electrophysiology or imaging, when patients present with weakness following an electric injury.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> To design a classification concentrating on the art and severity of functional restriction that could include all possible postoperative neurological disturbances and prove its validity to be comparable and easily used in neurosurgery. A seven grade classification was proposed commencing from grade \"0\" for no neurological disturbances to grade \"6\" for coma/vegetative state/demise: grade “1”, any remittent neurological disturbances with full improvement spontaneously or as a result of any temporary drug therapy or re-surgery, a single epileptic seizure without the need for anticonvulsant therapy; grade “2”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in no functional restrictions, no epileptic seizures needing for long-term anticonvulsant therapy; grade “3”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in slight functional restrictions, rare epileptic seizures despite of anticonvulsant therapy, slight aphasia; grade “4”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in moderate functional restrictions and partial need of outside help, average frequency of epileptic seizures despite anticonvulsant therapy, moderate aphasia; and grade “5”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in severe functional restriction and complete need of outside help, high frequency of epileptic seizures despite of anticonvulsant therapy, severe aphasia. The study included a total of 1681 operations at 1530 patients. The postoperative neurological disturbances occurred in 7.7% (n=119) of patients. All postoperative neurological disturbances could be easily classified according to the CPNC. The ranking system was proportional to the length of hospital stay. The CPNC is useful and easily applicable to assess the rates of postoperative neurological disturbances. It can be a comparable instrument in the quality management of neurosurgery.",

The cause of this damage in many cases remains unclear. The attention of investigators and practitioners is focused both on understanding the causative mechanisms of such accidents and in identifying 'alarm events' that can arise during the administration of a central block, if any.

      "title": "PATHOLOGICAL OSSIFICATION IN TRAUMATIC PARAPLEGIA",
      "abstract": "1. Ectopic ossification is commonest in, but not confined to, traumatic paraplegia. It occurs also in many other neurological disorders which have in common a gross disturbance of spinal cord reflex activity. It is a true ossification and must be distinguished from calcification. 2. The neurological lesion may lie anywhere from the cerebral cortex to the mixed peripheral nerve. It may involve motor tracts, sensory tracts or a mixture of both. 3. The ossification is localised and self-limiting. It occurs mainly in the lower limbs and is restricted to certain muscles or muscle groups, the nerve supply of which is always below the level of the central neurological lesion. 4. The blood chemistry is usually normal. 5. A true arthropathy is rare except as part of a secondary suppurative arthritis. 6. The resemblance to myositis ossificans progressiva or to ossifying haematoma is only superficial, although the pathological process at cellular level may be the same. 7. The period of onset after paraplegia is variable. The earliest recorded example is in one of our own cases in which ossification occurred nineteen days after injury. Other patients have developed ossification after several years. 8. The condition is commonest in acquired nervous disease rather than in congenital disorders, and so far as we know it has not been described in the myopathies. The presence of muscular spasticity or flaccidity is relevant only in that it indicates a disturbance of reflex activity. 9. Soft-tissue ulceration appears to be frequently associated with ectopic ossification. The type of new bone formation associated with large chronic ulcers is not to be compared with the new bone formation in the muscles of a paraplegic patient in otherwise good general condition. 10. The occurrence of urinary tract infections with calculi and generalised sepsis is not specifically related to the onset of new bone formation. 11. Localised soft-tissue oedema often precedes the formation of new bone. Its appearance is undoubtedly important, but the mechanism of its origin is obscure. 12. It is not yet known what initiates ectopic ossification, what limits its spread and what finally causes it to stop. 13. We have described 100 examples of ectopic ossification in 603 paraplegic patients. 14. Surgery has been required in only eight patients. The only indication for surgery is bony ankylosis of the hip in an unacceptable position.",

      "title": "Confusional status epilepticus in elderly",
      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Severe forms of blindness, resulting in a loss of light perception has a devastating impact on the functional ability (1), physiological state (2), and psychosocial well-being of affected patients (3). Severe visual impairment (acuity 20/200 or worse) affects around 0.7% of the population in Australia older than 49 yr (4), with the population weighted prevalence of profound visual impairment being 1.56/1000. In the United States more than one million people are legally blind with approx 10% having no light perception (5,6). Causes of adult blindness include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, end-stage retinal dystrophy, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve ischaemia, and trauma (7). One common factor with these pathologies is that once damage has occurred to neural tissue it is permanent because of the poor capacity of neural tissue in the central nervous system to regenerate. Recent experimental treatments, such as gene therapy, nerve cell transplantation, and growth factors have not been successful in restoring visual perception to blind patients (8). The only experimental method, which has successfully restored visual sensation to otherwise irreversibly blind patients is electrical stimulation of the retina, optic nerve, or brain with a prosthetic device (9,10). Of these three approaches, a prosthetic device, which acts on the visual area of the brain is the only method that has been investigated extensively in chronic human trials, and has restored visual perceptions, which have increased a blind patient's mobility and independence (11).",

This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

      "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated to many disorders localized to the neocortex, the hippocampal formation or both (dual pathology). The most common pathologies are mesial sclerosis, tumours, malformations and scars. However, these alterations are not intrinsically epileptogenic, as they are also seen in patients who do not develop epilepsy. Thus, the cortical tissue in the damaged brain undergoes changes that may become a primary epileptogenic region. This region, in turn, may induce the formation of secondary epileptogenic regions situated at some distance from the primary focus.In this paper we consider the possibility that in both the primary and secondary epileptogenic regions there are similar changes in the neuronal circuits which induce epileptic activity. In the case of the primary epileptogenic regions, these changes occur non specifically following an initial lesion or precipitating factor (e.g. a tumour) which induces gliosis and neuronal loss around the lesion. These changes give rise to a perilesional synaptic reorganization (elimination of connections with or without the formation of new synapses) which causes the onset and continuation of epileptic activity. However, the changes in the circuits in the secondary epileptogenic regions are the result of epileptic activity originated in the primary epileptogenic region which is propagated by specific anatomical connections. This anomalous activity causes changes in the target region (gliosis and neuronal loss) which leads to epileptogenic synaptic reorganization similar to that occurring in the primary perilesional areas.",

      "title": "Post-stroke language disorders.",
      "abstract": "Post-stroke language disorders are frequent and include aphasia, alexia, agraphia and acalculia. There are different definitions of aphasias, but the most widely accepted neurologic and/or neuropsychological definition is that aphasia is a loss or impairment of verbal communication, which occurs as a consequence of brain dysfunction. It manifests as impairment of almost all verbal abilities, e.g., abnormal verbal expression, difficulties in understanding spoken or written language, repetition, naming, reading and writing. During the history, many classifications of aphasia syndromes were established. For practical use, classification of aphasias according to fluency, comprehension and abilities of naming it seems to be most suitable (nonfluent aphasias: Broca's, transcortical motor, global and mixed transcortical aphasia; fluent aphasias: anomic, conduction, Wernicke's, transcortical sensory, subcortical aphasia). Aphasia is a common consequence of left hemispheric lesion and most common neuropsychological consequence of stroke, with a prevalence of one-third of all stroke patients in acute phase, although there are reports on even higher figures. Many speech impairments have a tendency of spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery is most remarkable in the first three months after stroke onset. Recovery of aphasias caused by ischemic stroke occurs earlier and it is most intensive in the first two weeks. In aphasias caused by hemorrhagic stroke, spontaneous recovery is slower and occurs from the fourth to the eighth week after stroke. The course and outcome of aphasia depend greatly on the type of aphasia. Regardless of the fact that a significant number of aphasias spontaneously improve, it is necessary to start treatment as soon as possible. The writing and reading disorders in stroke patients (alexias and agraphias) are more frequent than verified on routine examination, not only in less developed but also in large neurologic departments. Alexia is an acquired type of sensory aphasia where damage to the brain causes the patient to lose the ability to read. It is also called word blindness, text blindness or visual aphasia. Alexia refers to an acquired inability to read due to brain damage and must be distinguished from dyslexia, a developmental abnormality in which the individual is unable to learn to read, and from illiteracy, which reflects a poor educational background. Most aphasics are also alexic, but alexia may occur in the absence of aphasia and may occasionally be the sole disability resulting from specific brain lesions. There are different classifications of alexias. Traditionally, alexias are divided into three categories: pure alexia with agraphia, pure alexia without agraphia, and alexia associated with aphasia ('aphasic alexia'). Agraphia is defined as disruption of previously intact writing skills by brain damage. Writing involves several elements: language processing, spelling, visual perception, visuospatial orientation for graphic symbols, motor planning, and motor control of writing. A disturbance of any of these processes can impair writing. Agraphia may occur by itself or in association with aphasias, alexia, agnosia and apraxia. Agraphia can also result from 'peripheral' involvement of the motor act of writing. Like alexia, agraphia must be distinguished from illiteracy, where writing skills were never developed. Acalculia is a clinical syndrome of acquired deficits in mathematical calculation, either mentally or with paper and pencil. These language disturbances can be classified differently, but there are three principal types of acalculia: acalculia associated with language disturbances, including number paraphasia, number agraphia, or number alexia; acalculia secondary to visuospatial dysfunction with malalignment of numbers and columns, and primary anarithmetria entailing disruption of the computation process.",

      "title": "Fatty acid oxidation defects as a cause of neuromyopathic disease in infants and adults.",
      "abstract": "Fatty acids are a major fuel for the body and fatty acid oxidation is particularly important during fasting, sustained aerobic exercise & stress. The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders of fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney & liver. Defects of fatty acid oxidation lead to a range of neuromyopathic disease in both adults and children. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia with neurosensory deficits secondary to the acute onset. In addition, there may be cardiac arrhythmias and/or progressive cardiomyopathy, which may give rise to secondary hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. Diagnosis is through clinical suspicion with appropriate investigations in blood and urine taken during crisis. Definitive diagnosis is usually by fibroblast assay. Treatment is generally through avoidance of fasting, frequent carbohydrate rich feeds and in long-chain defects MCT supplementation. Novel treatments include the use of D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate and the potential use of fibrates to increase mutant protein levels in mild disorders.",

Numerous synaptic relays and neurotransmitters allow the autonomic control of organ function at local and central levels to be integrated with the requirements of the whole body. The peripheral and central components of the autonomic nervous system are frequently affected by diseases, conditions, or toxins. Autonomic disorders are described as (1) primary—without defined cause, including multiple system atrophy and acute/subacute dysautonomias; or (2) secondary—with specific defects or as a consequence of other conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Riley–Day syndrome, amyloid neuropathy, dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, spinal cord injury, and many drugs.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Conventional analgesics such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are often ineffective. Instead, antidepressants and anticonvulsants may be tried.

      "title": "Frontal Contusions Imaging and",
      "abstract": "A 38-yr-old man was involved in a motor vehicle crash and was noted to have an initial postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7. Computerized tomographic imaging revealed bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions. The patient began to follow commands at day 5, but he remained in posttraumatic amnesia for several weeks. Memory dysfunction and deficits in executive control persisted throughout the acute rehabilitation period. Frontal contusions are often the result of sufficient inertial loading and acceleration combined with a sudden stop (i.e., head impact or abrupt change in the direction of the head’s movement, which is often referred to as deceleration). This series of events may cause the brain to come into abrupt contact with one or more internal surfaces of the skull. Because the posterior areas within the skull are relatively smooth, primary contusion injuries in the posterior portions of the brain are rare in the absence of direct trauma to the occiput or posterior skull regions. More frequently, however, the anterior and inferior portions of the brain (the frontal poles, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior temporal lobes) become contused against the bony prominences of the skull (e.g., sphenoid wing and temporal fossa). The expansion (or blossoming) of the contusion may result in extensive frontal edema and hemorrhage either early after injury or even days later and may require neurosurgical intervention. The above example demonstrates a case of acute frontal contusions (Fig. 1) that evolve to show a wide area of frontal hemorrhagic edema (Fig. 2) and, subsequently, signs of early bifrontal encephalomalacia. This case demonstrates a version of hemorrhagic edema blossoming, as depicted in Figure 2. This injury pattern may result in localized contusion of the cerebral cortex and immediate underlying white matter. In the more chronic phase, such lesions are better demonstrated via magnetic resonance imaging.FIGURE 1: Day 1, initial computed tomographic scan showing frontal hemorrhagic contusions (arrow).FIGURE 2: Day 3, increasing hemorrhage and contusion (arrow) in the frontal region (so-called blossoming).Functionally, the frontal cerebral cortex is known to be involved in numerous cognitive activities, among them, executive control and memory. The construct of executive control encompasses numerous functions, but it is generally defined as the capacity to organize, plan, execute, and change cognitive functions. Executive control is a critical aspect of cognition that is commonly impaired after traumatic brain injury.1,2 In fact, although individuals and clinicians often report or emphasize memory as being a primary functional concern, executive control dysfunction might be the most disabling aspect of cognitive compromise after brain injury.3,4 The prefrontal cortex is of great importance in the processing of episodic memory. Finally, injury to the frontal cortex may lead to disturbances of mood and behavior.",

      "title": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease: a review of the problem and clinical cases",
      "abstract": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease represent a rare and diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders that differ from classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in terms of clinical presentation, genetic background, neuroimaging features, progression rate, and distribution of motor involvement. Diagnostic criteria of these variants include onset at a young or middle age, restriction to a specific anatomical region (bulbar or spinal), exclusive involvement of either the upper or lower motor neuron, the degree of motor neuron degeneration, absence of specific neuroimaging phenomena in certain subtypes, frequent association with other neurological symptoms (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment), and slow progression. Depending on the predominant site of involvement, this pathology can be divided into two major categories: affecting the upper and lower motor neuron. The first group includes primary lateral sclerosis and Mills syndrome. The lower motor neuron group comprises a broader and more heterogeneous spectrum, including progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy syndrome, flail arm syndrome, Hirayama disease (monomelic amyotrophy), O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, flail leg syndrome, and finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease. A concise clinical characterization of each variant is provided. This article describes original clinical cases of two atypical motor neuron disease variants, i.e. O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome and flail leg syndrome, analyzed in the context of a comprehensive literature review. Both cases, characterized by lower (peripheral) motor neuron involvement, underscore the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the complexity of the diagnostic process, illustrating the necessity of a broad, multimodal diagnostic approach and emphasizing the importance of dynamic patient monitoring. In such scenarios, time itself becomes a key diagnostic factor.",

      "title": "Promoting Physical Activity in People with Brain Impairments",
      "abstract": "Brain impairment is defined as a significant loss or abnormality in the brain structure. Brain impairments may be acquired as a result of trauma (e.g., traumatic brain injury or stroke), non-traumatic origins (e.g., tumour) or disease (e.g., Parkinsonrs disease or multiple sclerosis) or congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy) and are frequently associated with abnormal brain function (e.g., impaired memory, executive function and/ or impaired motor control). Evidence indicates that physical activity is beneficial for individuals with brain impairment as the subsequent loss of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and flexibility that occurs as a result of inactivity can compound the effects of the initial disability. Current cross-sectional evidence indicates that individuals with brain impairment are significantly less active than individuals without brain impairment. In order to address the low levels of physical activity in adults with brain impairment and thereby improve health, fitness and functioning, it is critical to develop interventions which effectively promote physically active behaviour in this population. The overall aim of the program of research described in this thesis is to contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based physical activity promotion strategies in individuals with brain impairment. This thesis presents studies relating to two major subpopulations of people with brain impairment: adolescents with cerebral palsy (Chapters Three and Four); and adults with brain impairment (Chapters Five and Six). Chapter Three presents a systematic review of the clinimetric properties of objective and subjective measures of physical activity in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Seven measures were included in this review. Each measure had notable limitations related to the assessment of physical activity intensity and duration and compliance with the physical activity guidelines. The review identified accelerometry as a promising means of measuring physical activity as it is objective and can collect real-time activity data on the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity, allowing for meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Four presents a study that evaluated the validity of the ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of physical activity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. Results indicated that the ActiGraph is able to differentiate between different intensities of walking and that, for the purpose of classifying activity intensity, the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. for typically developing children had excellent classifaction accuracy for detecting moderate to vigorous physical activity. These findings indicate that the ActiGraph is a suitable device for measuring free-living ambulatory physical activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and that the output can be used to make meaningful comparisons to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Five presents a systematic review of the research relating to physical activity and adults with brain impairment mapped against the five phases of a behavioral epidemiological framework. Results indicated that the vast majority of research to date has focused on identifying the benefits of physical activity for people with brain impairment; that measures previously used to evaluate physical activity participation do not allow meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines; that the evidence relating to correlates of physical activity has been largely concerned with levels of impairment and self-efficacy and; there is a relative paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions that promote physically active behaviour in this population. Currently there are no studies that evaluate the translation of physical activity interventions previously shown to be successful in controlled efficacy or effectiveness studies into widespread practice. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that future studies should consider a community-based rehabilitation model of intervention and that the rigor of such studies would be enhanced by the use of objective measures of physical activity. Chapter Six presents the results of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity promotion intervention for community-dwelling adults with brain impairment. The intervention utilised elements of a community-based rehabilitation approach to deliver a lifestyle intervention to community-dwelling adults with brain impairment and outcomes were evaluated using an objective measure of physical activity. After the 12-week program, intervention participants exhibited significant increases in average counts per minute (cpm) (60.9 p 20.7 cpm, p= .004) and daily average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (10.4 p 4.0 mins MVPA, p= .01). Daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity declined significantly among attention controls (-11.1 p 22.9 cpm; -2.6 p 4.5 mins MVPA). Net differences in daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity were 71.9 cpm (p= .02) and 12.9 mins MVPA (p= .03), respectively. Between-condition differences in the physical activity outcomes were not significant at 3-months follow-up. These findings are noteworthy given the particularly low rates of physical activity participation in this population and the significant physical and environmental barriers that individuals with brain impairment face. Given the rigour of the study, the results are sufficiently positive to warrant conducting a larger scale effectiveness trial utilising trained practitioners in clinical practice settings.n",

      "abstract": "A major barrier to advances in the field of mild traumatic brain injury assessment and treatment has been the continuous efforts to dichotomize causal factors. Mild traumatic brain injury in general and concussion in athletes in particular, offer a unique testing ground for hypotheses related to the interaction of psychological and biological variables. Most practicing clinical neuropsychologists recognize that the majority of individuals with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury recover quickly with minimal or conservative interventions. Athletes experiencing concussion often voice uncertainty regarding their health and their career. The very nature of concussion symptoms can be quite alarming and raise anxiety about threats to life or, at least, the quality of life. Symptoms comprising the post concussion syndrome are generally grouped into those of a physical, cognitive or psychological nature. The prevalence of persisting symptomatology in these three conditions is remarkably similar.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of seizures in the Neurosurgical/Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be categorized as emanating from either primary brain pathology, at either macro- or microscopic level, or from physiological derangements of critical care illness such as toxic or metabolic abnormalities. Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

As alterações neuropatológicas marcantes da DA são placas difusas e neuríticas, marcadas pela deposição extracelular de beta-amiloide, e emaranhados neurofibrilares, compostos pelo acúmulo intracelular de proteína tau hiperfosforilada. Os déficits cognitivos aparecem e progridem insidiosamente, o comprometimento da memória, especificamente a perda de memória de eventos recentes, é a característica mais frequente da DA e geralmente é sua primeira manifestação. Outros déficits cognitivos aparecem com ou após o desenvolvimento do comprometimento da memória. A disfunção executiva e habilidades visuoespaciais prejudicadas tendem a ser afetadas precocemente, enquanto déficits na função da linguagem e sintomas comportamentais geralmente se manifestam mais tarde. Os sintomas neuropsiquiátricos e comportamentais são comuns nos estágios intermediários e tardios da DA, mas podem ocorrer no início do curso em alguns pacientes. Os déficits neurológicos não cognitivos, sinais motores piramidais e extrapiramidais, mioclonias e convulsões podem ocorrer nos estágios finais da DA, mas são incomuns nos estágios iniciais e intermediários. As apresentações atípicas incluem uma variante visual (atrofia cortical posterior), uma variante com afasia progressiva e uma variante com disfunção executiva progressiva como sintoma predominante. As apresentações atípicas são mais comuns em pessoas mais jovens com DA. A DA é inexoravelmente progressiva, mas a taxa de progressão pode variar. A expectativa média de vida após o diagnóstico foi relatada entre 8 e 10 anos, mas pode variar de 3 a 20 anos. A DA deve ser suspeitada em qualquer idoso com início insidioso, declínio progressivo da memória e pelo menos um outro domínio cognitivo que leve ao funcionamento prejudicado.",

In instances in which the disordered spread of impulses is still wider, consciousness may be lost, tonic and clonic movements of both sides of the body may take place, sphincter control may be lost and various vasomotor changes be experienced and observed. As a rule, consciousness is not lost when the spread of the epileptic wave is not great or when it is limited to one cerebral cortex. The theory",

Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits).

There is a link between severity of the injury, fractures on the base of the skull, its foramina and channels, and the frequency of cranial nerve involvement. One should try to establish whether a posttraumatic dysfunction of the cranial nerves is primary or secondary in nature, i.e. due to raised intracranial pressure or haemorrhage. In children after head injuries often the cranial nerves of the oculomotor system are affected (20.2%/7.0%)--transient (permanent), followed by optic atrophy (4.88%), lesion of the trigeminal nerve (4.2%/2.2%), and the facial nerve lower motor type (4.1%/1.7%). Loss of hearing (3.3%/1.2%) and of smell (3.2%/1.2%) are less frequent in children than in adults.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Autonomic dysfunction may result from diseases that affect primarily either the central nervous system or the peripheral autonomic nervous system. The most common pathogenesis of disturbed autonomic function in central nervous system diseases is degeneration of the intermediolateral cell columns (progressive autonomic failure) or disease or damage to descending pathways that synapse on the intermediolateral column cells (spinal cord lesions, cerebrovascular disease, brainstem tumors, multiple sclerosis). The peripheral autonomic nervous system may be damaged in isolation in the acute and subacute autonomic neuropathies or in association with a generalized peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral neuropathies most likely to cause severe autonomic disturbance are those in which small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers are damaged in the baroreflex afferents, the vagal efferents to the heart, and the sympathetic efferent pathways to the mesenteric vascular bed. Acute demyelination of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the Guillain‐Barré syndrome may also cause acute autonomic dysfunction. Although autonomic disturbances may occur in other types of peripheral neuropathy, they are rarely clinically important.",

      "title": "Safety of Intraoperative Transcranial Electrical Stimulation Motor Evoked Potential Monitoring",
      "abstract": "Summary This article reviews intraoperative transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring safety based on comparison with other clinical and experimental brain stimulation methods and clinical experience in more than 15,000 cases. Comparative analysis indicates that brain damage and kindling are highly unlikely. There have been remarkably few adverse events. Pulse train TES-induced or coincidental seizures (n = 5) are rare, probably because of very brief (<0.03 second) stimuli, anesthesia, and the general absence of predisposing cerebral conditions. Soft bite blocks may prevent tongue or lip laceration (n = 29) or mandibular fracture (n = 1). Rare cardiac arrhythmia (n = 5) and intraoperative awareness (n = 1) may be coincidental. Minor scalp burns (n = 2) are rare. Although possible, no spinal epidural recording electrode complications or injuries resulting from TES-induced movement were found. There have been no recognized adverse neuropsychological effects, headaches, or endocrine disturbances. Comprehensive relative contraindications include epilepsy, cortical lesions, convexity skull defects, raised intracranial pressure, cardiac disease, proconvulsant medications or anesthetics, intracranial electrodes, vascular clips or shunts, and cardiac pacemakers or other implanted biomedical devices. Otherwise unexplained intraoperative seizures and possibly arrhythmias are indications to abort TES. With appropriate precautions in expert hands, the well-established benefits of TES MEP monitoring decidedly outweigh the associated risks.",

This article reviews fundamental issues that should be considered in understanding the nature of chronic pain including the distinction between acute and chronic pain; neurobiological distinctions between the lateral and medial pain system; nociceptive versus neuropathic or other central pain; sensitization effects; the widely accepted view of chronic pain as a multidimensional subjective experience involving sensory, motivational-affective and cognitive-behavioral components; the problem of mind-body dualism; the role of psychosocial factors in the onset, maintenance, exacerbation or severity of pain; plus issues of response bias and malingering.",

The latter group can be referred to as hypokinesia (decreased amplitude of movement), but bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and akinesia (loss of movement) are common alternatives. The parkinsonian syndromes are the most common cause of paucity of movement; other hypokinetic disorders represent only a small group of patients.

      "abstract": "Motivation – the capacity to experience enthusiasm for achieving a goal, which helps to initiate, guide and maintain behaviour – is a fundamental psychological process that serves to enable both survival and thriving in the face of challenge. Loss of motivation can have a debilitating impact on everyday function, resulting in difficulty working, studying and taking care of responsibilities at home; and, in extreme cases, a total loss of motivation results in the absence of any behaviour at all. Disrupted motivation can be expressed through a variety of clinical symptoms, including apathy, anhedonia and fatigue, which tend to cluster together. These motivational symptoms are very common, occurring across a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions, for example depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, but as yet we have no specific treatments for them. This chapter provides an introduction into research into the neuroscientific and psychological mechanisms underlying motivation, which has yielded important information regarding the key brain circuity and cognitive operations involved. There are several key messages. (i) Motivation is a multifactorial construct, comprising several distinct cognitive operations, and dysfunction in any one of these has the potential to result in motivational symptoms.",

In general, traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be divided into diffuse and focal injuries.

It discusses the entity of Second Impact Syndrome and describes its presentation, pathophysiology, and management. Skull fractures occur due to direct blunt trauma to the skull. The incidence of this type of injury in athletics has seen a dramatic reduction due to the implementation and improvement in protective equipment, specifically helmets. Patients may be asymptomatic on presentation with Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage or complain of headache, nausea, vomiting, or have a spectrum of neurological deficits depending on the extent of injury or location.",

      "title": "Resuscitation of the ischaemic brain",
      "abstract": "‘<i>Cerebral protection</i>’ signifies strategies used to protect neural tissue from cellular events induced by deprivation of oxygen or glucose or both to the brain. Neurons are particularly susceptible to ischemic injury because they have a higher demand for energy and limited energy stores. Depletion of intrinsic central nervous system energy stores occurs within 2 to 4 minutes of anoxia. Protecting the brain from ischemia during neurosurgery is one of the most important concerns for Neuro anesthesiologists. Pharmacological brain protection may be employed to rest the brain while a temporary regional disruption in nutrient flow is expected to occur. Appropriate monitoring (EEG, evoked potentials, stump pressure, trans-cranial doppler) is needed to optimise therapy. Cerebral protection may be initiated prior to the occurrence of brain ischaemia. Certain prophylactic measures can interfere with the cascade of events triggered by the injury. Such a salutary effect may be achieved by reducing demand for energy (using barbiturates or hypothermia) or blocking mediators of ischemic injury. In designing the anaesthetic plan for patients at high risk of cerebral ischaemia (e.g, carotid endarterectomy, open heart procedures), it is useful to consider the relative degree of protection provided by various agents. Treating patients with neuroprotective agents after cardiac arrest or a focal ischemic insult may be consideration in improving overall neurological outcome. Focal ischemia encompasses stroke subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and trauma. With few exceptions, animal studies have shown that therapeutic efficacy is lost if treatment is delayed more than one hour after impact. Sooner the neuroprotective drug is given, the better is the outcome.",

      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review In the central nervous system there are many regulatory processes controlling the lower urinary tract. This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease. Recent findings Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed (‘occult neurology’). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, ‘croaky’ speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols. Summary Urologists should consider an undiagnosed neurological condition can be present in a few cases. Any finding should be further evaluated by colleagues with relevant expertise.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy, one of the most common reasons for infirmity in children and young people in developed countries, refers to several neurological diseases that impact movement and coordination. Central nervous system damage received during the first stages of brain development can cause cerebral palsy, a non-progressive condition that manifests as impairments of movement and posture. Two cases per 1000 are reported, and the causes include those mentioned for high-risk infants. Mental retardation, sensory deficiencies, failure to thrive, seizures, and behavioral or emotional issues are some of the associated difficulties. To enable interdisciplinary intervention, early identification is crucial. The result varies depending on the topography, severity, and presence of concomitant abnormalities in cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is caused by a static injury to the cerebral motor cortex that happens before, during, or within five years after birth. Various circumstances can influence the disease, including cerebral anoxia, cerebral hemorrhage, infection, and hereditary disorders. Interventions for children are typically provided as part of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. Musculoskeletal complaints are common, and pain is a significant underreported symptom.",

Presentation ... Pathophysiology Spinal cord injury releases spinal preganglionic sympathetic motor neurons below the level of the injury from descending control by the rostral CNS. A series of abnormal reflexes develop (e.g., the plantar reflex) as new synaptic circuits form in the independent cord below the lesion. In some cases, a reflex arc develops and any form of sensory stimulus may cause a massive sympathetic discharge. Most commonly, this reflex is triggered by stretch of a hollow organ like the bowel or bladder. Severe hyperreflexia is common (50–90%) when the spinal injury is above the T6 level, but hyperreflexia may occur when the injury is as low as T10. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Immediate Management ... Subsequent Management If long-term therapy is required, consider oral therapy with diazoxide, mecamylamine, or phenoxybenzamine.",

      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

It usually occurred suddenly, with or without pain and the deficit may be complete or partial. Other nerve lesions and some precipitating conditions can be noticed and are important to assess the exact mechanism of the nerve lesion. Partial AIN lesion is frequently misdiagnosed as tendon rupture. The electrodiagnostic examination should always study the pronator quadratus or another muscle innervated by the AIN, the AIN conduction and the motor and sensory median nerve conduction. Thus electrodiagnosis will always assess the AIN lesion and precise its axonal or compressive mechanism. Mononeuritis as neuralgic amyotrophy is the most frequent cause of AIN palsy and never requires surgery. Traumatic lesions are less frequent and usually recover spontaneously. Thus, surgery is rarely required before 12 to 18 months except when no recovery occurs after trauma.",

Many DEEs are related to gene variants and the onset is typically during early childhood. In this setting, neurocognition, whilst not improved by seizure control, may benefit from some precision therapies. In patients with non‐progressive diseases with cognitive impairment and co‐existing epilepsy, in whom the epileptiform activity does not affect or has minimal effect on function, the term “developmental encephalopathy” (DE) can be used. In contrast, for those patients with direct impact on cognition due to epileptic or epileptiform activity, the term “epileptic encephalopathy” (EE) is preferred, as most can revert to their normal or near normal baseline cognitive state with appropriate intervention. These children need aggressive treatment. Clinicians must tailor care towards individual needs and realistic expectations for each affected person; those with DE are unlikely to gain from aggressive antiseizure medication whilst those with EE will gain. Patients with DEE might benefit from a precision medicine approach in order to reduce the overall burden of epilepsy.",

One of the most important consequences in the ischemic ictus is the cerebral damage, which is a consequence of a complex mixture of biochemical processes. Among them the excitoxicity mediated by glutamate. Not only has excitoxicity a central role in the IBD, but also in situations of acute trauma and in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. The focal model of obstruction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats by means of intraluminal suture that causes a cortical frontoparietal lesion as well as in the dorsolateral striatum allows evaluating the phenomena of cellular stress in the ischemic focus or in oligaemia areas or ischemic penumbra. The cerebral ischemia unchains a sequence of molecular phenomena that begin with the lack of energy secondary to the interruption of the processes of oxidative phosphorylation and the deficit of adenosin triphosphate (ATP) production. These processes could be responsible for several degenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, epilepsy and schizophrenia. The study of these processes could increase the understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, allowing progress in design of neuroprotective strategies, achieving to decrease the mortality and morbidity of patients with IBD.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic head injury pituitary dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Partial or complete pituitary dysfunction affects 33–50% of all traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors and is a significant contributor to the overall disability burden. The hypophyseal vessels are anatomically vulnerable to shearing injuries, raised intracranial pressure and anterior base of skull fractures, and pituitary ischaemia or haemorrhage is a common finding at autopsy. Post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) can affect all grades of severity of injury and is often difficult to diagnose, as its features largely overlap with common post-concussive symptoms. PTHP has a wide range of manifestations, including fatigue, myopathy, cognitive difficulties, depression, behavioural changes or life-threatening complications such as sodium dysregulation and adrenal crisis. In some instances, mild PTHP can recover, at least partially, but cases of late onset are also known. At present, there is no consensus on whether all TBI patients should be screened (including mild TBI) and at what time points, given that neuroendocrine tests in the acute phase are simply likely to reflect a non-specific trauma response rather than true pituitary damage and that the time course of PTHP is unclear. A full investigation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis requires specialized neuroendocrine assessment, including stimulation tests, as random hormone levels can be misleading in this context. Given the high incidence of TBI, this may have significant resource implications for Endocrinology services but, on the other hand, patients with PTHP may receive suboptimal rehabilitation unless the underlying hormone deficiency is identified and treated.",

The level of consciousness should be assessed by observing the patient's spontaneous behaviour and their ability to respond to stimuli of varying intensity by speech, eye opening and motor movements. The Glasgow Coma Scale is the most widely used and reproducible scale to assess the level of consciousness. The locked-in syndrome is characterised by preservation of consciousness with dissociation between automatic and volitional control of lower cranial nerve and limb function. Minimally conscious state is characterised by inconsistent but reproducible responses above the level of spontaneous or reflex behaviour, which indicates some degree of interaction with surroundings. Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome is characterised by complete absence of behavioural evidence for self or environmental awareness. Patients with neuromuscular disease require neurological intensive care unit care when they develop acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure or acute bulbar or limb weakness.",

Today, hypoxia is considered to be an essential cause of such lesions; in contrast to views held previously, birth trauma, i.e., physical injury to an infant during its delivery, is of minor pathogenetic importance. Neurohistological studies showed that it is especially prolonged hypoxia - in addition to cerebral hemorrhage, damage to the cerebral parenchyma and medullary substance - which can cause lesion of the brain stem. A relatively frequent occurrence are isolated ischemic cerebrospinal nerve cell lesions.

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "title": "Migraine is a marker for systemic disease",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, We read with interest the article titled \"Retinal arterial occlusions in the young: Systemic[1] associations in Indian population by Ratra et al. Authors have mentioned severe headache, floaters and transient blurring of vision as the presenting symptoms in a subset of patients. Visual aura (migraine) are fully reversible symptoms including positive features (e.g., flickering of lights, spots or lines) and negative features (i.e., loss of vision). A migraine diathesis may be a marker for an underlying defect such as hypertension, hypercoagulability, lupus erythematosis or mitral valve prolapse and therefore might occasionally co-occur with[2] vascular occlusion or retinal vasospasm. Experts disagree whether retinal migraine is a rare or common cause of monocular visual loss and whether the mechanism is spreading depression or vasospasm. Complicated migraine refers to a permanent neurologic deficit whether it is visual, motor or sensory in origin. In some instances the stroke does not respect the usual middle or posterior cerebral artery territories suggesting that a strict vascular mechanism is insufficient to[3] explain all migraine-related stroke phenomena. Cocaine abuse cause hypertensive surges, stroke, arterial and venous thrombosis. Neuroimaging studies in cocaine abusers demonstrated abnormal perfusion involving the infraparietal,[4] temporal and anterofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Dopamine is one of the[5] numerous neurotransmitters present in outer and inner layers of the retina. Cocaine abuse,[3] exercise and lupus cause non-migrainous retinal vasospasm and transient monocular visual loss. Authors have documented hypertension, cerebrovascular accident and basal ganglia infarction in a 37-year-old patient. In our practice we routinely inform the possibility of underlying systemic disease and importance of physician consultation in all patients with migraine. Perimetry may be useful to identify coexisting cerebral ischemia in patients with retinal vascular occlusion and normal neuroimaging study. We appreciate the authors' effort and research work.

From the review of the literature remain three factors which alone or in combination, are of special etiologic interest: nerve lesion due to the needle or intraneural injection; toxic effects of the agent injected overall when epinephrine is used; ischemic trauma. The symptoms of such nerve lesions vary from light paresthesia to painful dysesthesia and motor weakness or paralysis. The clinical analysis of these complications does not differ from that in other neurological patients, but must be realized effectively and immediately for avoiding a lawsuit. These postanesthetic neuropathies may benefit from specific treatment or even surgical exploration and external neurolysis.

Sleep disorder can cause many complications, including the worsening of the brain injury prognosis. Insomnia occurs in 29% traumatic brain injury patient. Insomnia suspected due injury in inferior frontal, anterior temporal including basal forebrain, also sympathetic nerve hyperactivity. Insomnia increase the risk of stroke, disability and mood disturbance. Hypersomnia occurs in 28% traumatic brain injury patients. Hypersomnia suspected due orexin decrease and injury in sleep promoting area. Hypersomnia suspected related to recovery, less activity time and accident due sleepiness. There are no prevalence data of circadian rhythm disturbance after traumatic brain injury. This disturbance is caused by injury in supra-chiasmatic nucleus and related to global worsening on the patient. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly linked with injury area, but hypersomnia is not particularly linked to any area and only related to orexin decrease. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly related to the worsening condition on the patient, but hypersomnia is associated with recovery and not particularly related to any disturbances. It is hoped that understanding the sleep disorder after traumatic brain injury can rise the alertness of this matter and encourage clinicians to increase the quality of sleep disorder due to traumatic brain injury management. Cedera kepala merupakan salah satu cedera yang umum terjadi. Cedera ini sering diikuti dengan gangguan tidur seperti insomnia, hipersomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian. Gangguan ini sering dapat menyebabkan berbagai komplikasi termasuk memperparah penyembuhan cedera kepala. Insomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 29%. Insomnia diduga disebabkan oleh cedera pada daerah inferior frontal, anterior temporal termasuk basal otak depan, juga peningkatan kerja saraf simpatis. Insomnia meningkatkan resiko stroke, disabilitas dan gangguan suasana hati. Hipersomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 28%. Hipersomnia diduga akibat penurunan orexin dan akibat kerusakan pada area yang mempertahankan bangun. Hipersomnia diduga berhubungan dengan penyembuhan, waktu tersita akibat tidur dan kecelakaan akibat mengantuk. Belum ada data prevalensi gangguan ritme sirkadian setelah cedera kepala. Gangguan ini disebabkan oleh cedera pada nukleus suprakiasmatik dan sering dikaitkan dengan perburukan kondisi pasien. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian sering dihubungkan dengan lokasi tertentu dari cedera, namun hipersomnia berhubungan dengan kadar orexin dan tidak terlalu dikaitkan terhadap area tertentu. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian berhubungan dengan perburukan, namun hipersomnia bisa menandakan perbaikan dan tidak berhubungan signifikan dengan gangguan lainnya. Diharapkan dengan memahami gangguan tidur ini dapat meningkatkan kewaspadaan bagi para klinisi dan mendorong untuk penelitian berikutnya sehingga penanganan pasien gangguan tidur akibat cedera kepala dapat menjadi lebih baik.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged, self-sustained seizure that can manifest as a prolonged convulsion, subtle facial or limb twitching, or simply altered mental status, always in association with a persistent electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure pattern. In clinical trials, convulsive seizures lasting longer than 5 min are often treated as SE,1 whereas epidemiological studies have defined 30 min of continuous convulsive seizures or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness as SE.2 There are 126,000 to 195,000 episodes of SE associated with 22,000 to 42,000 deaths each year in the United States when SE is defined as 30 min of seizures.2 As many as 50% of patients older than 65 years of age who suffer from SE die within 30 days of the episode. Although mortality is far less common in younger patients, they are at risk for neurological morbidity, such as injury to the hippocampus3 and neuropsychological dysfunction.4 Prolonged seizures can also lead to significant systemic complications, including pulmonary congestion and edema, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, elevation of body temperature, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and rhabdomylosis. These systemic complications tend to worsen as more seizures occur.5 It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving condition.5,6 Ongoing seizures rapidly modify neuronal activity and synaptic function.7 This rapid neuronal plasticity is manifest in changes in behavioral seizures, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and evolution of neuronal injury and death. Although these changes are continuous, it is convenient to divide SE into stages for the purposes of investigation and treatment (Table 41–1).",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

Optical coherence tomography and angiography have become two of the most important imaging modalities in neuro-ophthalmology. Optic neuritis is one of the most common causes of subacute unilateral visual loss in young adults. Ophthalmic involvement is a result of direct fungal infiltration or ischaemic infarction and this leads to acute ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, periorbital oedema and blindness from central retinal artery occlusion or an optic neuropathy.

      "abstract": "The Central Nervous System (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, while the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction are common manifestations of acute brain dysfunction,occurring in up to 70% of post- surgical patients. The development of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have long- term consequences,such as higher morbidity and mortality and increased hospital stay,and it increases the risk of dependency and institutionalisation. Delirium presents clinically with differing subtypes ranging from hyperactive to hypoactive. Despite the relevance of these cognitive disorders,the specific aetiology is still unknown,and there are many factors that have been associated with its development. In many forms of delirium,the brain's reaction to a peripheral inflammatory process is considered to be a pathophysiological key element and the aged brain seems to react more markedly to a peripheral inflammatory stimulus than a younger brain. The risk factors for delirium are categorised as predisposing or precipitating factors. In the presence of many predisposing factors,well documented predisposing factors are age,medical comorbidities,cognitive,functional,visual and hearing impairment and institutional residence. Important precipitating factors apart from surgery are admission to an ICU,anticholinergic drugs,alcohol or drug withdrawal,infections,iatrogenic complications,metabolic derangements,pain and the exposure to analgesics( opioids) and hypnotics( benzodiazepines). Several bedside instruments are available for the routine ward and ICU setting. The Confusion Assessment Method( CAM) and a version specifically developed for the intensive care setting( CAM- ICU) have emerged as a standard.Non- pharmacological multicomponent strategies and pharmacological prophylaxis may be useful to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. Perioperative administration of haloperidol has been shown to reduce the severity and the incidence of delirium. The multicomponent interventions for prevention and treatment have been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of episodes.",

Some gradual mental decline is seen with normal aging.

      "abstract": "Hypoxic-ischaemic damage to the developing brain is a leading cause of child death, with high mortality and morbidity, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and cognitive disabilities. The developmental stage of the brain and the severity of the insult influence the selective regional vulnerability and the subsequent clinical manifestations. The increased susceptibility to hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) of periventricular white matter in preterm infants predisposes the immature brain to motor, cognitive, and sensory deficits, with cognitive impairment associated with earlier gestational age. In term infants HI causes selective damage to sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. Even though the immature brain is more malleable to external stimuli compared to the adult one, a hypoxic-ischaemic event to the neonate interrupts the shaping of central motor pathways and can affect normal developmental plasticity through altering neurotransmission, changes in cellular signalling, neural connectivity and function, wrong targeted innervation, and interruption of developmental apoptosis. Models of neonatal HI demonstrate three morphologically different types of cell death, that is, apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, which crosstalk and can exist as a continuum in the same cell. In the present review we discuss the mechanisms of HI injury to the immature brain and the way they affect plasticity.",

      "title": "Response to Intervention: The Functional Assessment of Children Returning to School with Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury to children ages 0-14 results in an estimated 435,000 visits to emergency medical departments each year (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2009). Of these visits, 37,000 TBI children are hospitalized, with a reported 2,685 deaths. The number of unreported incidents of TBI is unknown. Survivors of TBI face a variable course of recovery that depends upon the type, location and severity of injury. Traumatic brain injury is defined as a form of acquired brain injury that occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain and results from the head suddenly hitting an object or when an object pierces the skull and enters the brain (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2009). Symptoms of TBI can be classified as mild, moderate or severe and can appear across multiple domains of functioning, including medical, sensory-motor, cognitive and social-personality (Brain Injury Association of Massachusetts, 2009). Medical symptoms include seizures, headaches, dizziness, weakness and fatigue. Sensory-motor symptoms include problems with coordination, balance, speech, sensation, hearing, and vision. Cognitive symptoms include impaired reasoning and memory, difficulty finding words, lack of safety awareness, distractibility and difficulty adjusting to change. Social-personality symptoms include agitation, anxiety, aggression, depression, emotional instability, substance abuse, and poor judgment and insight. An ideal course of recovery includes a reduction in the number and severity of symptoms, and full recovery is not always possible. The course of recovery often involves short- and long-term gains during which time the symptoms improve and abate over a trend line of recovery. Successful case management often requires frequent and periodic observations of functional behavior, with modifications made to the medical and educational intervention to address the presentation of symptoms. The case management of children with TBI involves many interacting factors, including cognitive, behavioral, educational, social and family issues (Ylvisaker et al., 2005). Ultimately, the success of long term recovery includes the coordination of medical, educational and parental involvement. Participation in programs to facilitate transition to the community and the school is an essential component of rehabilitation discharge. Todis and Glang (2008) followed 33 students with TBI. Students receiving transition services linking them to appropriate support agencies were more likely to complete their educational programming than students without such services. TBI victims who participated in community re-entry programs that taught compensatory strategies for cognitive deficits and that provided counseling and education for personal and family adjustment were more likely to demonstrate improvement on measures on overall disability (High, Roebuck-Spencer, Sander, Struchen & Sherer, 2006). Victims of TBI victims who started their transition services soon after discharge were more likely to demonstrate functional independence at follow-up than TBI who delay their participation. Such evidence favors a close collaboration between rehabilitation and educational agencies in order to provide transition services in a timely manner. Despite the importance of transition services for students re-entering the school after a TBI, many students do not receive formal services. A survey of 56 youths with TBI indicated that 21 percent received formal hospital-to-school transition services while 41 percent received some informal support (Glang, Todis, Thomas, Hood, Bedell & Cockrell, 2008). The link between hospital and school is considered a critical factor in addressing the educational needs of the returning student. These results suggest that injury severity and a formal hospital-to-school transition service are significant factors in assisting with recovery as students return to school. …",

The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

This is in contrast with adults, where status epilepticus after head injury is thought to be an ominous sign. Rapid improvement in level of consciousness after prompt treatment is certainly the most important criterion in assessing the role of the seizures. In the same period of time, post-traumatic status epilepticus was not seen in children with more severe head injury.",

Its pathophysiology involves an ischemic process, secondary to impairment of cerebral perfusion and its determinants and a neuroinflammatory process that includes endothelial activation, alteration of the blood–brain barrier and passage of neurotoxic mediators. Microcirculatory dysfunction is common to these two processes. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term cognitive disability. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurological examination that can lead to specific investigations, including electrophysiological testing or neuroimaging. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected. Hepatic, uremic or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, sedative or opioid withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses. Currently, treatment consists mainly of controlling sepsis. The effects of insulin therapy and steroids need to be assessed. Various drugs acting on sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier dysfunction, brain oxidative stress and inflammation have been tested in septic animals but not yet in patients.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

Nervous system problems: Nervous system problems can cause imbalances by causing problems in communicating with your body’s sensory information and motor functions. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances.

      "abstract": "Hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury that occurs during the perinatal period is one of the most commonly recognized causes of severe, long-term neurologic deficits in children; it is often referred to as cerebral palsy. Despite improvements in perinatal practice during the past several decades, the incidence of cerebral palsy attributed to intrapartum asphyxia has remained essentially unchanged, primarily because management strategies were supportive and not targeted toward the processes of ongoing injury. Two processes of neuronal injury can be demonstrated after hypoxia-ischemia: neuronal necrosis and apoptosis. Because the mechanisms of these processes likely differ, strategies to minimize brain damage in an affected infant after hypoxia-ischemia likely will have to include interventions that target both processes. The goals of management of a newborn infant who has sustained a hypoxic-ischemic insult and is at risk for evolving injury should include (1) early identification of the infant at highest risk for evolving to the syndrome of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, (2) supportive care to facilitate adequate perfusion and nutrients to the brain, and (3) consideration of interventions to ameliorate the processes of ongoing brain injury. Although the neurology group was unable to develop a definitive framework for the study of neuroprotective strategies for neonatal encephalopathy, it (1) listed key questions to be addressed before exploring possible study designs for managing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates, (2) identified important study-design issues, (3) determined general principles and key elements for neuroprotective-treatment strategies, (4) identified potential treatment strategies, (5) proposed a clinical-trial framework, and (6) identified key elements for a potential clinical-trial framework comparing hypothermia with hypothermia \"plus\" for moderate-to-severe encephalopathy.",

More severe TBI injuries may result in structural injuries to the ocular muscles, nerves, or the brain itself.NA.Case: We present the case of a 33-year-old male with unilateral abducens nerve palsy after a sports-related concussion with loss of consciousness and multiple hemorrhagic contusions. The patient's visual symptoms manifested several days after the injury. With a multi-disciplinary evaluation involving specialists representing neurosurgery, endovascular neurology and neuro-ophthamology, unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple foci of intraparenchymal microhemorrhages and siderosis consistent with diffuse axonal injury (DAI), and an incidental parasagittal cavernoma. The delayed development of a sixth nerve palsy raised our suspicion for secondary axotomy, as has been described following TBI. While the probability of recovery is high, close follow up is imperative to address evolution of the patient's symptoms. In this case, the patient developed imbalance and headaches in association with his visual symptoms. For the imbalance we use physical therapy with therapists trained in vestibular therapy and for the visual symptoms we use vision therapy with trained optometrists.Delayed post-traumatic abducens palsy is concerning for DAI and secondary axotomy. Multidisciplinary assessment imparts the ability to evaluate for all possible causes and provide additional specialized care for recovery.",

Biological diagnosis of insulinomas Plasma glucose concentrationsSince the clinical symptoms lack diagnostic specificity, measurement of plasma concentration of glucose is mandatory (ideally at the time of occurrence of clinical symptoms) and must be performed in venous blood samples with a reliable laboratory method.In order to avoid pseudohypoglycaemia, i.e. a consequence of glucose metabolism by blood cells in the tube containing the blood sample, the blood sample should be collected in a tube with a glycolysis inhibitor (NaF).Glucose concentrations are measured using reference method with hexokinase.",

As usually accepted, this term is limited to a syndrome consisting of the sudden appearance of symptoms and signs of involvement of the central nervous system in a patient with early (primary or secondary) syphilis, who has received an amount of treatment insufficient to eradicate the infection, and has then lapsed from treatment. The clinical manifestations are varied, but usually consist of an acute or subacute syphilitic meningitis, commonly with, but sometimes without, focal lesions of the cranial nerves. The early literature on this subject was filled with a controversy as to whether these lesions were caused by the harmful effects of arsenicals or by syphilis. The controversy has long since been settled. Neurorecurrences are due, not to arsphenamine, but to too little arsphenamine; the symptoms usually disappear",

More than half of people over 50 complain about weakening of their previous intellectual performance, reduced mood, impaired memory, psychomotor slowing down, decreased ability to concentrate and divide attention, extend reaction time and reduce motor performance. The basis of mental changes in the elderly are changes in the brain. The changes arising in the aging brain are the result of pathological processes: metabolic and altered cerebral circulation. These changes, and mainly their extent, consequently cause brain dysfunction and are manifested mainly in the deterioration of mental functions. The brain is first and foremost the material basis of a mental life. With age, slow, cumulative and irreversible morphological and functional changes occur in the human brain. This process is slow, which is why it is accompanied by a number of compensation mechanisms. This phenomenon occurs regardless of gender. The aim of this article is to present the key issues related to memory functioning in the elderly, with particular emphasis on neurocognitive impairment after surgery.",

      "abstract": "Temporal plus epilepsy is defined as focal epilepsy in which the primary epileptogenic area extends beyond the temporal lobe. It involves the neighboring regions such as the insula, the suprasilvian opercular cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the temporo-parieto-occipital junction. The objective of this review is to provide an update in temporal plus epilepsy. A previous history of brain trauma, a history of tonic clonic seizures, and previous central nervous system infection are risk factors. They likely allowed the generation of complex hippocampal and extrahypocampic neural networks. Clinical manifestations will depend on the location of the epileptogenic zone as well as the rapid propagation into temporal mesial structures. Video-electroencephalography usually shows involvement of the temporal lobe, with rapid propagation into the perisilvian, orbitofrontal or temporo-parieto-occipital regions. The magnetoelectroencephaography has lesser muscle contamination and could be considered as a biomarker of early states in the diagnosis process. Brain MRI is usually negative or shows non-specific mesial temporal abnormalities. Stereoelectroencephalography is the invasive method of choice. Temporal plus epilepsy is considered to be the most common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy surgery failure and represents up to 30%.Epilepsia del lóbulo temporal plus: revisión.La epilepsia del lóbulo temporal plus se define como la epilepsia en la cual la zona epileptógena primaria se localiza en el lóbulo temporal y se extiende a regiones vecinas, como la ínsula, la corteza opercular suprasilviana, la corteza orbitofrontal y la unión temporoparietooccipital. El objetivo de esta revisión es proveer una actualización de la información en la epilepsia del lóbulo temporal plus. La historia de traumatismo craneoencefálico, infección cerebral (meningitis-encefalitis) o crisis epiléptica tonicoclónica generalizada está involucrada en su etiología, y permite la generación de redes neuronales complejas hipocámpicas y extrahipocámpicas. Las manifestaciones clínicas dependen de la zona epileptógena involucrada y de su rápida proyección a las estructuras temporales mesiales. El videoelectroencefalograma evidencia actividad interictal extensa e ictal en el lóbulo temporal, pero con rápida propagación perisilviana, orbitofrontal o temporoparietooccipital. La magnetoelectroencefalografía tiene menos contaminación muscular y podría considerarse como un biomarcador de estados tempranos en el proceso diagnóstico. La resonancia cerebral generalmente es negativa o muestra una ligera alteración de señal en la zona mesial temporal en grado variable. El estereoelectroencefalograma es el método invasivo de elección, especialmente guiado por robot.

We report a neurologically normal infant without nystagmus but with intermittent head nodding and intermittent esotropia, whose head movements manifested only when his eyes were straight. The head movements ceased with the occlusion of either eye or spontaneous onset of esotropia. When his head was forcibly stabilized, he immediately developed esotropia.

The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit and her EEG showed intermittent slowing over the left temporal region, interictal spikes from the left mid-anterior temporal field, and one seizure was recorded with left-sided onset with rapid generalization. The greatest factor impacting seizure outcome after tumor treatment is the presence of seizures at presentation. Brain tumors cause seizures via tumor epileptogenicity and peritumoral epileptogenicity. Peritumoral epileptogenicity is due to metabolic and neurotransmitter changes in peritumoral brain, morphologic changes (including malformation and cortical dysplasia), immunologic change in the peritumoral brain, and peritumoral blood products, gliosis, and necrosis which directly irritate or alter the microenvironment.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

El criterio del tiempo minimo para definir «estado epileptico» se redujo de 30 a cinco minutos, delimitado como actividad convulsiva continua o convulsiones recurrentes rapidas sin recuperacion de la conciencia durante mas de cinco minutos. Esta definicion considera que las crisis que persisten durante mas de cinco minutos probablemente lo haran durante mas de 30.

      "title": "Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent acute sensory and motor neuropathy in a single or multiple nerves. The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HNPP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and either the 1.5-Mb recurrent deletion or a novel deletion involving PMP22 (in 80%), or a PMP22 sequence variant (in 20%) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves occupational therapy and physical therapy as needed to address issues with fine motor and gross motor skills, including activities of daily living. Bracing, such as with a wrist splint or ankle-foot orthosis, may be useful transiently or in some instances permanently. Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Neuropathic pain can be treated with analgesic medications. Protective pads at elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves. Surveillance: Routine screening neurologic examination focused on muscle atrophy, strength, sensory loss, and neuropathic pain; physical and occupational therapy assessments of gross motor and fine motor skills and activities of daily living; foot examinations for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged sitting with legs crossed; prolonged leaning on elbows; occupations requiring repetitive movements of the wrist; rapid weight loss; vincristine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Asymptomatic relatives at risk may wish to clarify their genetic status by undergoing molecular genetic testing for the PMP22 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member in order to be advised about agents and circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling HNPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 20% of individuals with HNPP have the disorder as the result of a de novo PMP22 pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual is at a 50% risk of inheriting the PMP22 pathogenic variant. Once the PMP22 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age.

      "abstract": "Dementia is a sustained, multidimensional loss of cognitive function secondary to organic central nervous system damage, unaccompanied by evidence of an acute superimposed state of clouded consciousness as occurs with delirium or reduced arousal. The onset of dementia can be abrupt, maximal, and static, e.g., following cardiac arrest or severe head trauma, or progressive such as occurs in the degenerative diseases of aging. Of the two forms the progressive types of dementia create by far the more frequent problem and, reflecting the increased longevity of the population, have become one of the major public health concerns of the Western world. Over 6% of adults aged over 65 years and 20% over the age of 80 are estimated to suffer from a medically or socially disabling degree of dementia.",

      "title": "Neuroimmune Crosstalk in CNS Disorders: The Histamine Connection",
      "abstract": "The neuroimmune system represents a dense network of biochemical signals associated with neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, neurohormones, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors synthesized in neurons, glial cells and immune cells, to maintain systemic homeostasis. Endogenous and/or exogenous, noxious stimuli in any tissue are captured by sensor cells to inform the brain; likewise, signals originating at the central nervous system (CNS) level are transmitted to peripheral immune effectors which react to central stimuli. This multidirectional information system makes it possible for the CNS to respond to peripheral damage and for alterations in brain function to be reflected in peripheral immune changes. Different CNS disorders, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, migraine, epilepsy, vascular dementia, mental retardation, cerebrovascular encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, cranial nerve neuropathies, mental retardation and post-traumatic brain injury exhibit changes in CD3, CD4, CD7, HLA-DR, CD25, CD28, and CD56 immune markers. Histamine is an important pleiotropic factor in neuroimmune regulation. This biogenic amine shows age-and sex-dependent changes in the CNS, and is significantly altered, together with interleukin- 1β and TNF-α, in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in which neuroinflammation appears to be an aggravating phenotype. Therapeutic intervention to halt progression of deleterious neuroinflammatory reactions in CNS disorders is a major challenge for molecular pharmacology in the future.

      "title": "ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY IN CHILD NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY",
      "abstract": "The principal applications of electroencephalography to child neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry are as follows: Abnormalities in the EEG of parents or siblings of patients with nervous or mental disease assists in evaluating possible hereditary factors. Nervous and mental disorders caused by abnormalities of intrauterine development, injuries or anoxia at birth, encephalopathies of toxic, metabolic or infectious origin, and severe head injuries, may be reflected in abnormal brain waves in many but not all cases. In some, the location and type of cerebral pathology may allow marked changes in behavior, such as spastic paraplegia, with no significant alteration in the EEG. The EEG gives little reliable information with regard to intelligence and the finer structure of personality. Cerebral damage due to tumor, abscess, trauma or local vascular lesion may be localized by the EEG but pathologic diagnosis must be made from a careful history and other methods of clinical examination in most cases.proved methods, deepseated lesions involving subcortical structures, as well as superficial lesions, may frequently be accurately localized by the EEG. Subdural hematomata are not accurately diagnosed by the EEG in most cases. The EEG is most useful in the epilepsies and convulsive disorders. Differential diagnosis between idiopathic epilepsy and symptomatic convulsive disorders can usually be made by the EEG except for certain postencephalitic conditions which may simulate the electroencephalographic patterns of the idiopathic or \"genetic\" epilepsies. The form of clinical seizure depends upon the brain area of onset of the epileptic discharge, and its path of spread. The form of electrical disturbance has no specific significance except as pointing to a certain localization of onset. A wide variety of seizures are caused by focal epileptic discharge arising primarily in various areas of the cortex. These may be localized by the EEG when on the convexity of the hemispheres, but may be missed when buried in fissures or on the ventral or mesial surfaces of the brain. They are frequently discovered only when electrodes are placed directly on the brain surface exposed at operation. Bifrontal rhythmic disturbances may be caused by foci on the mesial or orbital surface of one frontal lobe. Bitemporal rhythmic disturbances may be caused by a focal epileptogenic lesion deep in one temporal region. The wave and spike pattern of petit mal epilepsy can be reproduced by local stimulation in certain parts of the thalamus. The EEG may be of assistance in assessing the initial severity and progress of recovery from cerebral trauma due to head injury. Profound alterations in the EEG occur during the acute stage of any form of encephalitis. Residual changes are of value in prognosis, especially with regard to epileptiform disorders. In child psychiatry, the EEG may point to an unsuspected organic basis for particularly intractable behavior. However, it is of little value for specific diagnostic purposes except as related to epileptic equivalent states and disorders due to focal lesions or diffuse encephalopathy.",

DAI is caused by angular or rotational acceleration of the victim's head. The condition is common and is the second most important head injury after subdural hematoma with regard to death. Its clinical picture is characterized by immediate and prolonged coma or demented state. Because of the subtle nature of histological changes in DAI, awareness and intentional search for the lesion is essential. The triad of DAI is as follows: focal lesions (hemorrhages and/or lacerations) in the corpus callosum and brain stem, and microscopic demonstration of axonal damage—retraction balls. The concept of DAI will elucidate and enhance the understanding of many head trauma cases.",

A la suite des premieres observations de troubles de l'action et de l'affect (apathie, apragmatisme, indifference affective, perte d'interet), consecutives a la destruction, selective mais bilaterale, des noyaux pallidaux, est nee la notion de syndrome athymhormique, concu comme un trouble specifique de la capacite des sujets a convertir leurs affects en action. Outre cette pathologie de la motivation proprement dite, les patients decrivent souvent, mais non toujours, une experience tres particuliere de vide mental, laissant presumer que les systemes en cause controlent egalement certains aspects de l'activite mentale spontanee. Toutefois, cette absence d'activite physique et mentale spontanee contraste avec la preservation des capacites motrices et intellectuelles, lorsu'elles sont stimulees exterieurement. Parallelement, ces constatations cliniques ont permis de devoiler un aspect insoupconne des fonctions des noyaux gris centraux, en montrant que, de la meme maniere que cela avait ete precedemment decrit chez l'animal, la motivation humaine est dependante de l'activite d'un circuit cortico-sous-cortical bilateral centre sur le couple striato-pallidal, plus specialement dans leurs portions anatomiquement connectees aux elements du systeme limbique. Ce circuit limbique' comprend ainsi la portion ventrale du striato-pallidum (noyau caude et pallidum interne), le thalamus dorso-median, le cortex frontal median. L'analyse des cas publies de syndrome athymhormique suggere qu'une lesion bilaterale de ce circuit, a n'importe quel point de son trajet cortico-sous-cortical, est necessaire et suffisante pour provoquer les elements du syndrome athymhormique. Outre son interet neurophysiologique et clinique, l'introduction de ce nouveau concept en neuropsychologie ouvre des perspectives interessantes pour la physiopathologie de certaines maladies psychiatriques.",

One likely cause of glare is abnormal light scatter in eyes with cloudy ocular media (due to cataract, corneal opacities, vitreous debris, etc.). Another possible cause of glare may be neural in origin. There is some evidence 2 for greater lateral masking in peripheral vision than in central vision. Therefore, individuals with central field loss who must use their peripheral vision to read or recognize objects may be bothered by glare, even though their ocular media are clear. We are investigating glare in low-vision subjects with clear or cloudy media, and different forms of field loss.",

      "title": "Status epilepticus.",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a condition in which multiple epileptic seizures occur without complete recovery from the physiological effects of one seizure before another seizure occurs. There are as many types of SE as there are kinds of epileptic seizures. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus initially presents with repeated generalized convulsions without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. If untreated or undertreated, the convulsive activity becomes progressively subtle and is accompanied by a predictable series of progressive EEG changes. Non-convulsive SE refers to complex partial SE or absence SE, both of which exhibit an epileptic twilight state of altered contact with the environment. In simple partial SE there is no impairment of consciousness, and the behavioural changes reflect focal ictal discharges confined to one area of the cortex. There are between 65,000 and 150,000 cases of the SE in the US each year. Both acute and remote cerebral insults can cause SE, as can severe systemic disease that causes SE secondary to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Mortality is high, but is largely a reflection of underlying aetiology when SE is treated appropriately and aggressively. Treatment is focused on terminating ongoing seizure activity as quickly as possible, both because the longer SE persists the more likely permanent neuronal damage will ensure and also because of strong evidence that the longer SE persists the more refractory to treatment it will be. Currently the most commonly accepted treatment protocol involves rapid initiation of therapy with intravenous lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg), followed, if necessary, by 20 mg/kg of phenytoin, followed, if necessary, by 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital. However, some neurologists still use intravenous diazepam (because of its more rapid antistatus effect) followed by phenytoin. New experimental data in the rat suggest that phenytoin followed by diazepam may be more effective, but this order of administration still has to tested in properly designed clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Factors contributing to brain damage and an adverse outcome are complex. Both severe hypoxia-ischemia and prolonged hypoxia of lesser severity may cause brain damage. Compromised cerebral perfusion leads to ischemia. Fetal brain damage may begin because of a redistribution rather than reduction of cerebral blood flow. Normal newborn cerebral blood flow is low; fetal asphyxia at birth causes delayed cerebral hyperperfusion in the neonate. The threshold of newborn cerebral blood flow that is associated with brain damage has not yet been established. Hypoxia-ischemia will disrupt cerebral metabolism. The fetus can compensate for hypoxia up to a point; however, decompensation will occur when acidosis becomes severe. Normal newborn cerebral oxygen consumption is low compared with that in the adult; however, asphyxia, causing brain damage, is associated with abnormal newborn cerebral metabolism. Supplementary glucose may have a protective effect in the newborn brain. Hypoxia-ischemia will cause brain damage in the human fetus and neonate. There is a threshold of fetal asphyxia at birth when brain damage may occur. Sustained neonatal hypotension and hypoxemia are associated with brain damage and an adverse outcome.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive disorders are frequently found during late-life depression. Many cognitive functions may be concerned and can be explained by fronto-striatal brain circuits and hippocampus dysfunctions partly through abnormalities related to cerebrovascular diseases. It seems important to distinguish between early and late onset depression whose cognitive characterisation and etiopathogenia differ in some aspects. Cognitive impairment may represent markers of depression but it is still unclear whether one should consider potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or risk factor. These disorders may precede depression and persist despite symptomatic remission. Moreover, the interest of specifying these disorders is multiple because they can have pejorative consequences such as the modification of emotional content, promote suicidal act, limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy, be a risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. or be a potential risk factor for progression to a minor or major neurocognitive disorder, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

Neurological examination shows a symmetrical sensory loss to all modalities, reduced or absent ankle or knee reflexes, and small muscle wasting of the feet and hands. Positive sensory symptoms can arise spontaneously or as a response to stimulation, and they are often classified into painful and non-painful descriptors. Positive symptoms of neuropathy are distressing, often at night, disabling, and difficult to treat. Diabetic nerves are thought to be more susceptible to mechanical injury. The most common is the carpal tunnel syndrome, in which paraesthesiae and sometimes numbness occur in the fingers and hands. Management of diabetic neuropathy begins with explanation and empathy, the exclusion of other causes of neuropathy, and then the institution of tight glycaemic control.",

Under normal conditions, the corneal nerve terminals incorporate sensors that monitor the thickness and integrity of the tear film, which are essential for meaningful vision. A disrupted tear film or direct noxious stimulation of these corneal nerves can produce discomfort or pain limited to the affected surface. Damage to these nerves can sometimes lead to a chronic neuropathic condition, where pain persists months following the initial insult, long after the nerves appear to have healed in the cornea itself following treatment. Neuropathic pain appears to persist indefinitely in a few patients.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss can result from disorders or damage to the ear (peripheral auditory system) or the brain (central auditory system). Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

He developed gait disturbance and weakness of lower limbs at age 52 years. Because of progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, he became bed‐ridden at age 65. At age of 68, he died. His neurological findings presented slight cognitive disturbance, slight manic state, severe muscle weakness, atrophy of four limbs and no extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, and cerebellar ataxia. Neuropathologically, mild neuronal loss and abundant lipid deposits were noted in the neuronal cytoplasm throughout the nervous system, including peripheral autonomic neurons. The most outstanding findings were marked neuronal loss and distended neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which supports his clinical symptomatology of lower motor neuron disease in this case. The presence of lipofuscin, zebra bodies and membranous cytoplasmic bodies ( MCB ) and the increase of GM 2 ganglioside by biochemistry led to diagnosis of GM 2 gangliosidosis.",

When neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia are indicated, the anesthesiologist should be aware of the risks and benefits of the technique. Neuraxial anesthesia is not absolutely contraindicated in nervous system diseases and there are undeniable benefits to ruling out general anesthesia. In patients with coexisting neurologic disorders, prolonged sensory and motor block can be confused with epidural hematoma and abscess when present. Minor nerve injury from local anesthetic cytotoxicity or ischemia and mechanical trauma may cause permanent nerve injury through the double crush phenomenon.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "A 56-year-old man (AB) presented with dramatic cognitive deterioration following a mild traumatic brain injury. There was no indication of severe brain injury or significant anoxic encephalopathy. Detailed history indicated no significant pre-morbid cognitive deficits. His pre-injury psychosocial and occupational functioning was intact. Cognition functioning was impaired immediately post-injury and remained impaired. Neuropsychological examination at 8 months post-injury showed severe cognitive deficits. The cognitive profile was consistent with Alzheimer's disease. MRI at 1-year post-injury showed minor ischaemic changes not consistent with hypoxic injury and insufficient to explain his cognitive problems. Early SPECT was consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and a repeat SPECT showed a significant deterioration in an Alzheimer pattern. AB was seen for detailed serial neuropsychological examination over a 3-year period, which revealed clear evidence of cognitive deterioration consistent with Alzheimer's disease. AB is presented as an unusual case of rapid progressive AD following a mild head injury.",

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Neuromuscular diseases include neuronopathies, neuropathies, myasthenic syndromes, and myopathies. An accurate neurological examination and complementary investigations are necessary for both diagnosis and for evaluating the severity of the disease. Assessment of respiratory muscle function is a key step in deciding the need for mechanical ventilation and subsequently its weaning. Hypercapnia often indicates an impending respiratory arrest, but normocapnia, which can be seen in a patient with severe reduction in vital capacity is not reassuring. Hypoxaemia can be due to hypercapnia, pulmonary injury (atelectasis or pneumonia), or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac evaluation is important as cardiomyopathies are frequent in myopathies.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome that spans the area between normal ageing and dementia. It is classified into amnestic and non-amnestic types, both with two subtypes: single domain and multiple domains. Prevalence of MCI depends on criteria and population and can vary from 0.1 to 42% persons of older age. In contrast to dementia, cognitive deterioration is less severe and activities of daily living are preserved. Most impaired higher cognitive functions in MCI are memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial functions, attention etc. Also there are depression, apathy or psychomotor agitation, and signs of psychosis. Aetiology of MCI is multiple, mostly neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, internistic, neurological, traumatic and iatrogenic. Persons with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease, while those with a single non-memory domain are at risk of developing frontotemporal dementia. Some MCI patients also progress to other dementia types, vascular among others. In contrast, some patients have a stationary course, some improve, while others even normalize. Every suspicion of MCI warrants a detailed clinical exploration to discover underlying aetiology, laboratory analyses, neuroimaging methods and some cases require a detailed neuropsychological assessment. At the present time there is no efficacious therapy for cognitive decline in MCI or the one that could postpone conversion to dementia. The treatment of curable causes, application of preventive measures and risk factor control are reasonable measures in the absence of specific therapy.",

      "title": "[Neuropsychological disorders in minor hemisphere damage].",
      "abstract": "Damage to the minor hemisphere or the right hemisphere of most right-handed subjects produces various neuropsychological disorders. Unilateral spatial neglect is the deficit to respond or orient to stimuli on the left side. The inferior parietal lobule is most frequently involved in the lesions of neglect patients, but lesions confined to the lobule may not cause chronic neglect. Severe and lasting neglect is frequently found in patients with an infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery or the anterior choroidal artery. Neglect is usually mild or moderate after frontal lesions. The most important mechanism of neglect seems to be disorders in spatial attention: rightward attentional bias, and impairment in disengagement and shift of attention from the right side. Directional hypokinesia is rarely observed in the chronic stage. Non-spatial factors, such as motivational deficit, insufficient compensation with verbal intelligence, or disuse of an appropriate spatial strategy may also contribute to the appearance of neglect. Anosognosia for hemiplegia is found in about half of patients with acute cerebrovascular accidents in the right hemisphere. Generalized attentional and intellectual deficits, diffuse brain atrophy or hypometabolism, and presence of multiple infarction may result in chronic anosognosia. Constructional disability is observed in about 30% patients with either hemisphere damage. Dressing apraxia is more frequent in right hemisphere damage. These two disorders, however, rarely appear as isolated neuropsychological deficits. Most patients show some of the accompanying disorders, such as unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia, anosodiaphoria, and generalized attentional and intellectual impairment. By contrast, motor neglect may occur independently of the other disorders. Motor neglect follows damage to either hemisphere, although it occurs more frequently after right hemisphere damage. Neuropsychological deficits characteristic of right hemisphere damage may be unilateral spatial neglect in the acute and chronic stages and anosognosia for hemiplegia in the acute stage.",

Optic atrophy is a clinical state in which there is pallor of the optic nerve due to loss of ganglion cell axons and supporting microvascular tissue, often associated with decreased vision. Optic neuropathy is a more general term that includes the early phase of the disease when optic atrophy may not yet be present. Clinical severity may vary from lack of symptoms to complete blindness. Hereditary causes of optic neuropathy include primary optic nerve disease; compression by a genetically determined tumor, for example, in neurofibromatosis; or degeneration, as occurs in the later stages of retinitis pigmentosa. Although glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and has features like other hereditary optic neuropathies, it is not discussed in this chapter. Optic atrophy may be an isolated event or may be associated with other neurologic or systemic manifestations. In this chapter we discuss Kjer autosomal dominant optic atrophy and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) as well as optic atrophy associated with Wolfram syndrome and some of the neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a common denominator in many of the hereditary optic neuropathies.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Neuropathic pain, or pain associated with disease or injury to the peripheral or central nervous system, is a common symptom of a heterogeneous group of conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Chronic neuropathic pain should not be thought of as a symptom. It should truly be thought of as a disease with a very complicated pathophysiology. Pathophysiology. The mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central pathophysiologic phenomenon. The underlying dysfunction may involve deafferentation within the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuropathy), deafferentation within the central nervous system (e.g. post-thalamic stroke) or an imbalance between the two (e.g. phantom limb pain). Clinical characteristics. Neuropathic pain is non-nociceptive, in contrast to acute nociceptive pain, and it can be described as ?burning?, ?electric?, ?tingling?, and ?shooting? in nature. Treatment. Rational polypharmacy is often necessary and actually it is almost always the rule. It would be an exception if a patient was completely satisfied with his treatment. Treatment goals should include understanding that our patients may need to be titrated and managed with more than one agent and one type of treatment. There should be the balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Conclusion. There are many new agents and new applications of the existing agents being currently studied which will most certainly lead to even more improved ways of managing this very complicated set of disorders.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

      "title": "Anosognosia in patients with Alzheimer's disease: current perspectives",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by neurocognitive impairments, especially memory impairment, as core symptoms linked to reductions in activities of daily life. As marginal symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) appear during the progressive course of the disease. A lack of self-awareness (anosognosia) of cognitive and functional impairments is often seen in patients with AD, and associations between anosognosia and other NPSs have been previously reported. To account for anosognosia pathogenesis neurocognitively, the cognitive awareness model (CAM) has been helpful for explaining the stream of events from sensory input to behavioural/affective and metacognitive outputs. According to CAM, there are three types of anosognosia: (i) primary anosognosia, (ii) executive anosognosia, and (iii) mnemonic anosognosia. These types of anosognosia are generated from different neurocognitive modulations leading to metacognitive outputs or behavioural/affective regulations. Primary anosognosia is considered to be caused by deficits in the metacognitive awareness system (MAS). While preserved MAS function is associated with milder depression and anxiety in AD, a severer depressive mood in patients with mild AD can inversely cause self-underestimation. The modulation of executive anosognosia is thought to be associated with dangerous/disinhibition behaviours and apathy among NPS sub-symptoms, via impairments of comparator mechanism (Cm) within the central executive system. Other neurobehavioral reactions linked to self-awareness include 'denying' and 'confabulation', and each of these reactions is thought to be affected by the MAS and a Cm. Denial of one's own memory impairments appears as a defensive reaction to protect against dysphoric feelings, and the confabulatory comment is instantly reaction constructed by fabrications according to misinterpretations of memory information about oneself. Similarly, the innovative development of a theoretical model (CAM) has contributed to explaining the mechanism of anosognosia and some neurobehavioral outputs from a neurocognitive perspective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Bedside assessment of consciousness and awareness after a severe brain injury might be hampered by confounding clinical factors (i.e., pitfalls) interfering with the production of behavioral or motor responses to external stimuli. Despite the use of validated clinical scales, a high misdiagnosis rate is indeed observed. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 49 patients with severe brain injury admitted to an acute neuro-rehabilitation program. Patients’ behavior was assessed using the Motor Behavior Tool and Coma Recovery Scale Revised. All patients underwent systematic assessment for pitfalls including polyneuropathy and/or myopathy and/or myelopathy, major cranial nerve palsies, non-convulsive status epilepticus, aphasia (expressive or comprehensive), cortical blindness, thalamic involvement and frontal akinetic syndrome. A high prevalence (75%) of pitfalls potentially interfering with sensory afference (polyneuropathy, myopathy, myelopathy, and sensory aphasia), motor efference (polyneuropathy, myopathy, motor aphasia, and frontal akinetic syndrome), and intrinsic brain activity (thalamic involvement and epilepsy) was found. Nonetheless, the motor behavior tool identified residual cognition (i.e. a cognitive motor dissociation condition) regardless of the presence of these pitfalls in 70% of the patients diagnosed as unresponsive using the Coma Recovery Scale Revised. On one hand, pitfalls might contribute to misdiagnosis. On the other, it could be argued that they are clues for diagnosing cognitive motor dissociation rather than true disorders of consciousness given their prominent effect on the sensory–motor input–output balance.",

Vitamin deficiencies can also cause memory loss (especially vitamin B12, B1, and D). Hormonal imbalances, particularly thyroid disorders, can mimic memory disorders. Memory problems can also come from bodily stress, infections, and diseases (including Lyme disease, COVID-19, encephalitis, diabetes, major surgeries and anesthesia, organ failure, and poor sleep). Many neurologic disorders can cause memory problems, particularly if the hippocampus, frontal lobes, or temporal lobes are involved. Neurologic disorders include brain tumors, epilepsy and seizures, multiple sclerosis, strokes, transient global amnesia, and traumatic brain injury. Psychiatric disorders can also cause memory problems, including anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disease, schizophrenia, electroconvulsive therapy, dissociative amnesia, and alcohol or drug use.",

      "abstract": "Memory problems are a common complaint in most older persons. The brain has two kinds of memory – recent and remote (old). Recent memory includes facts or events that occurred within the last hour so, while remote (old) memory is facts or events from the distant past, e.g., college memories, high school memories, etc. Recent memory is like a computer workstation while remote memory or old memory is like the hard disk. The brain remembers facts or events by loading them into recent memory and then moving them to old memory. Your hard disk becomes saturated somewhere around 40 to 60-years of age and after 60 it becomes slightly more difficult to hold on to facts or events. Scientists recognize four general types of memory states for older people: 1) good as new, 2) good as almost new, 3) mild impairment, and 4) dementia. “Good as new” means that you can remember things as well as when you were 20 or 30 years of age. “Good as almost new” means that it’s harder to remember large bodies of information but you can still commit normal amounts of information to memory. Mild cognitive impairment means that memory is impaired to the point where people have difficulty, but they do not have other evidence of dementia. Dementia means that memory is lost and other intellectual functions are also damaged, e.g., communication, motor skills.",

      "title": "Axonal injury following mild traumatic brain injury is exacerbated by repetitive insult and is linked to the delayed attenuation of NeuN expression without concomitant neuronal death in the mouse",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects brain structure and function and can lead to persistent abnormalities. Repetitive mTBI exacerbates the acute phase response to injury. Nonetheless, its long‐term implications remain poorly understood, particularly in the context of traumatic axonal injury (TAI), a player in TBI morbidity via axonal disconnection, synaptic loss and retrograde neuronal perturbation. In contrast to the examination of these processes in the acute phase of injury, the chronic‐phase burden of TAI and/or its implications for retrograde neuronal perturbation or death have received little consideration. To critically assess this issue, murine neocortical tissue was investigated at acute (24‐h postinjury, 24hpi) and chronic time points (28‐days postinjury, 28dpi) after singular or repetitive mTBI induced by central fluid percussion injury (cFPI). Neurons were immunofluorescently labeled for NeuroTrace and NeuN (all neurons), p‐c‐Jun (axotomized neurons) and DRAQ5 (cell nuclei), imaged in 3D and quantified in automated manner. Single mTBI produced axotomy in 10% of neurons at 24hpi and the percentage increased after repetitive injury. The fraction of p‐c‐Jun+ neurons decreased at 28dpi but without neuronal loss (NeuroTrace), suggesting their reorganization and/or repair following TAI. In contrast, NeuN+ neurons decreased with repetitive injury at 24hpi while the corresponding fraction of NeuroTrace+ neurons decreased over 28dpi. Attenuated NeuN expression was linked exclusively to non‐axotomized neurons at 24hpi which extended to the axotomized at 28dpi, revealing a delayed response of the axotomized neurons. Collectively, we demonstrate an increased burden of TAI after repetitive mTBI, which is most striking in the acute phase response to the injury. Our finding of widespread axotomy in large fields of intact neurons contradicts the notion that repetitive mTBI elicits progressive neuronal death, rather, emphasizing the importance of axotomy‐mediated change.",

The paper presents the results of studies showing a decrease in the severity of extrapyramidal disorders, pain syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and various kinds of addictions in patients after a stroke. Cases of regression of epileptic seizures and behavioral disorders after traumatic brain injury are also considered. It is emphasized that such unusual effects are based on the reorganization of cerebral connections with the activation of inhibitory mechanisms that normally do not manifest themselves clinically, or with certain features of neuroplasticity processes occurring in pathological conditions.",

      "title": "Functional anatomy of the mandibular nerve: Consequences of nerve injury and entrapment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Various anatomic structures including bone, muscle, or fibrous bands may entrap and potentially compress branches of the mandibular nerve (MN). The infratemporal fossa is a common location for MN compression and one of the most difficult regions of the skull to access surgically. Other potential sites for entrapment of the MN and its branches include, a totally or partially ossified pterygospinous or pterygoalar ligament, a large lamina of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process, the medial fibers of the lower belly of the lateral pterygoid muscle and the inner fibers of the medial pterygoid muscle. The clinical consequences of MN entrapment are dependent upon which branches are compressed. Compression of the MN motor branches can lead to paresis or weakness in the innervated muscles, whereas compression of the sensory branches can provoke neuralgia or paresthesia. Compression of one of the major branches of the MN, the lingual nerve (LN), is associated with numbness, hypoesthesia, or even anesthesia of the tongue, loss of taste in the anterior two thirds of the tongue, anesthesia of the lingual gums, pain, and speech articulation disorders. The aim of this article is to review, the anatomy of the MN and its major branches with relation to their vulnerability to entrapment. Because the LN expresses an increased vulnerability to entrapment neuropathies as a result of its anatomical location, frequent variations, as well as from irregular osseous, fibrous, or muscular irregularities in the region of the infratemporal fossa, particular emphasis is placed on the LN.

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

On the one hand, a simple physical tissue trauma that has failed to heal, does not explain what is currently observed as chronic pain behavior. Psychological problems and/or secondary gain are associated factors, suggesting the lack of a physical disorder. Recent findings on the neural mechanisms of pain, indicate that there may be some individuals whose traumatic event may have sensitized certain neurophysiologic processes to interpret as pain, from experiences of otherwise ordinary sensory-perception events. These central sensitization events could be caused or aggravated by various combinations of trauma, psychological disorders, or secondary gain and may provide at least a partial explanation of why some persons may develop chronic pain, and others will not.",

The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness.

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Encephalopathies and epileptic seizures are usually distinct, but important, components of neurologic illnesses. Each may cause altered mental status and behavior, but by different mechanisms. Encephalopathies involve widespread, usually inhibitory, brain dysfunction. Epileptic seizures usually consist of paroxysmal rhythmic excitatory brain activity that produces abnormal function. Some syndromes include both. Sometimes, an encephalopathy may cause seizures, and many patients are encephalopathic postictally. Nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus may be difficult to distinguish from encephalopathies. The EEG is crucial in the distinction, but epileptiform features may appear in either. The greatest area of overlap and difficulty in diagnosis is probably that following clinical seizures, when a patient may have a postictal encephalopathy or may still be seizing.",

      "abstract": "Complications occurring at any level of fetal oxygen supply can result in hypoxemia, which may ultimately lead to hypoxia/acidosis and neurological damage. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the short-term neurological dysfunction caused by intrapartum hypoxia/acidosis. This diagnosis requires the presence of several findings, including confirmation of newborn metabolic acidosis, low Apgar scores, early imaging evidence of cerebral edema, and the appearance of clinical signs of neurological dysfunction in the first 48 hours of life. Cerebral palsy (CP) comprises a heterogeneous group of nonprogressive movement and posture disorders, often accompanied by cognitive and sensory impairments, epilepsy, nutritional deficiencies, and secondary musculoskeletal lesions. Although CP is the most common long-term neurological complication associated with intrapartum hypoxia/acidosis, over 80% of cases are caused by other factors. Data on minor long-term neurological deficits are limited, but they suggest that less severe intellectual and motor impairments may result from intrapartum hypoxia/acidosis. Birth asphyxia is a broad term referring to intrapartum asphyxia severe enough to cause neurological damage in some newborns and, rarely, intrapartum or neonatal death. Cerebral palsy and long-term neurological complications such as learning difficulties and motor impairments may have causes other than birth asphyxia. Several intrapartum events can lead to asphyxia (i.e., hypoxia and metabolic acidosis), increasing the likelihood of neurological injury. The cardiotocograph (CTG) is a screening tool used to assess fetal well-being during labor and to identify the possibility of asphyxia. An abnormal CTG, sometimes severe enough to be described as a pathological trace, is commonly referred to as “fetal distress”, although many fetuses with such traces may not have hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. In current practice, these events are appropriately termed “pathological CTG trace” or “acidotic pH” rather than “fetal distress”. Accurate interpretation of the CTG is essential, and it is important to recognize a fetus displaying a pathological CTG in labor, which may imply possible hypoxia and birth asphyxia. Considering the broader clinical context when interpreting the CTG and taking timely and appropriate action based on the findings may help prevent birth asphyxia.",

      "abstract": "• Six patients had ischemic infarcts in the paramedian thalamic, subthalamic, and mesencephalic areas. In addition to ocular motility problems, ataxia, dysmetria, and mild pyramidal signs, there were consistent behavioral observations and neuropsychological findings. All of the patients had initial deficits in arousal, and gradually improved to normal wakefulness. When awake, all of the patients had impaired attention, mental control, and slowed verbal and motor responsiveness. They were apathetic, poorly motivated, and affect was flat or occasionally labile. All of the patients had a memory disorder characterized by anterograde and retrograde loss. One patient had significant language impairment. These deficits persisted in all but one patient who had a predominantly mesencephalic lesion. We believe the cluster of findings in these patients constitutes a characteristic syndrome of dementia related to paramedian mesencephalic and diencephalic infarcts. This syndrome bears close resemblance to that associated with some subcortical degenerative disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy. In cases of paramedian mesencephalic and diencephalic infarcts, however, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can delineate clinicoanatomic relationships that account for specific constituents of the syndrome.",

      "title": "Movement disorders in patients with peripheral facial palsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute unilateral facial paralysis is usually a benign neurological condition that resolves in a few weeks. However, it can also be the source of a transient or long‐lasting severe motor dysfunction, featuring disorders of automatic and voluntary movement. This review is organized according to the two most easily recognizable phases in the evolution of facial paralysis: (1) Just after presentation of facial palsy, patients may exhibit an increase in their spontaneous blinking rate as well as a sustained low‐level contraction of the muscles of the nonparalyzed side, occasionally leading to blepharospasm‐like muscle activity. This finding may be due to an increase in the excitability of facial motoneurons and brainstem interneurons mediating trigeminofacial reflexes. (2) If axonal damage has occurred, axonal regeneration beginning at approximately 3 months after the lesion leads inevitably to clinically evident or subclinical hyperactivity of the previously paralyzed hemifacial muscles. The full‐blown postparalytic facial syndrome consists of synkinesis, myokymia, and unwanted hemifacial mass contractions accompanying normal facial movements. The syndrome has probably multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including abnormal axonal branching after aberrant axonal regeneration and enhanced facial motoneuronal excitability. Although the syndrome is relieved with local injections of botulinum toxin, fear of such uncomfortable contractions may lead the patients to avoid certain facial movements, with the implications that this behavior might have on their emotional expressions. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Because an epilepsy occurring at a time interval after a cranio-cerebral trauma can be considered post-traumatic epilepsy, so in a causal relationship with the trauma, it must meet some conditions. Epilepsy is a chronic cerebral disorder manifested by recurrent, spontaneous epileptic seizures; with a sudden episode, a stereotype of motor, sensitive, sensory, behavioural manifestation, and / or alteration of the state of consciousness due to sudden, unprovoked activation of a neuronal population. To support the diagnosis of the first epileptic seizure, additional information is required from the anamnesis, the general and neurological clinical examination of the patient. The diagnostic approach continues, under the direct supervision of the neurologist, by identifying the aetiology of epilepsy. The study includes 27 epilepsy cases studied in 2014-2018. The most common type of epileptic seizure is the tonic-clonic one that affects the entire brain, and this is also the most visible form of epilepsy that manifests itself in the form of a generalized crisis, identified by involuntary convulsions that lead to partial or total loss of consciousness during the crisis. Epilepsy is caused by an explosion of intense electrical activity that suddenly occurs in the brain, and the resulting convulsions can occur in several forms depending on the area where this intense brain activity occurs.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability, particularly among young adults. During closed head trauma, the injury process is initiated by the impact of the brain against the inner table of the calvarium. Subsequently, there is prompt initiation of a complex biochemical, cellular, and physiological injury cascade that may take days to complete. From a functional standpoint, this culminates in neurologic dysfunction and, if severe, death. This unit describes an impact-induced brain trauma model in rats which replicates nonpenetrating head injury. It does not model either penetrating or ischemic brain injuries.",

      "title": "The etiology of sudden death",
      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "title": "Limb Apraxias: The Influence of Higher Order Perceptual and Semantic Deficits in Motor Recovery After Stroke",
      "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Limb apraxia is a group of higher order motor disorders associated with greater disability and dependence after stroke. Original neuropsychology studies distinguished separate brain pathways involved in perception and action, known as the dual stream hypothesis. This framework has allowed a better understanding of the deficits identified in Limb Apraxia. In this review, we propose a hierarchical organization of this disorder, in which a distinction can be made between several visuomotor pathways that lead to purposeful actions. Based on this, executive apraxias (such as limb kinetic apraxia) cause deficits in executing fine motor hand skills, and intermediate apraxias (such as optic ataxia and tactile apraxia) cause deficits in reaching to grasp and manipulating objects in space. These disorders usually affect the contralesional limb. A further set of disorders collectively known as limb apraxias include deficits in gesture imitation, pantomime, gesture recognition, and object use. These are due to deficits in integrating perceptual and semantic information to generate complex movements. Limb apraxias are usually caused by left-hemisphere lesions in right-handed stroke patients, affecting both limbs. An anterior- to posterior-axis of brain areas are disrupted depending on the increasing involvement of perceptual and semantic processes with each condition. Lower-level executive apraxias are linked to lesions in the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia, while intermediate apraxias are linked to lesions in dorso-dorsal subdivisions of the dorsal fronto-parietal networks. Limb apraxias can be caused by lesions in both dorsal and ventral subdivisions including the ventro-dorsal stream and a third visuomotor pathway, involved in body schema and social cognition. Rehabilitation of these disorders with behavioral therapies has aimed to either restore perceptuo-semantic deficits or compensate to overcome these deficits. Further studies are required to better stratify patients, using modern neurophysiology and neuroimaging techniques, to provide targeted and personalized therapies for these disorders in the future.",

      "abstract": "Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms following minor head trauma. Although these symptoms resolve within a few weeks in many patients, in some the symptoms may last much longer and impede ability to return to work and full functioning. Causes of persisting or recurrent dizziness may include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, so-called labyrinthine concussion, unilateral vestibular nerve injury or damage to the utricle or saccule, perilymphatic fistula, or less commonly traumatic endolymphatic hydrops. Some dizziness after head trauma is due to nonlabyrinthine causes that may be related to structural or microstructural central nervous system injury or to more complicated interactions between migraine, generalized anxiety, and issues related to patients self-perception, predisposing psychological states, and environmental and stress-related factors. In this article, the authors review both the inner ear causes of dizziness after concussion and also the current understanding of chronic postconcussive dizziness when no peripheral vestibular cause can be identified.",

Puede generar déficit notables en funciones psicológicas importantes como la ejecutiva, la atención o la memoria y evolucionar hasta un cuadro de pseudodemencia susceptible de mejorar con tratamiento antidepresivo.Objetivo: describir el funcionamiento de la memoria explícita en el trastorno depresivo mayor. Materiales y métodos: se hizo una búsqueda en la base de datos PUBMED con las palabras clave “major depression” (depresión mayor), “explicit memory” (memoria explícita) y “recollection memory” (memoria de recolección); se tomaron los artículos publicados después del año 2000; adicionalmente se incluyó bibliografía científica relevante para el cumplimiento del objetivo. Desarrollo: en la neuroanatomía del trastorno depresivo mayor se encuentran implicadas redes fronto-subcorticales (como las áreas prefrontales, tálamo, ganglios basales, hipocampo, entre otras). Estas estructuras pueden presentar atrofias que explicarían la persistencia o cronicidad de algunos de los síntomas cognitivos de la depresión. Las alteraciones en la memoria explícita, declarativa o de recolección, son de particular importancia por ser las más frecuentemente encontradas en sujetos con uno o más episodios depresivos mayores, y la estructura cerebral que se ha correlacionado más directamente con alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la memoria explícita es el hipocampo. Se ha observado actividad continua de neurogénesis en el hipocampo de animales adultos, la cual es especialmente susceptible cuando hay exposición prolongada a situaciones de estrés grave. Esto se evidencia en estudios que han encontrado reducido su volumen en sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor, en comparación con individuos sanos. De todas maneras, aunque no se encuentre una reducción marcada del volumen, se sugiere que hay una alteración de su funcionamiento.Conclusiones: la memoria explícita es un proceso psicológico con base biológica precisa, cuya estructura y funcionamiento se alteran en presencia de una condición menos precisa como la depresión mayor.",

Charles-Bonnet syndrome is characterized by the occurrence of visual hallucinations that are formed, complex, persistent or repetitive, and stereotyped; fully or partially retained insight; and absent delusions. Peduncular hallucinosis may develop following rostral brainstem lesion and characterized by seeing animals of bizarre appearance, transformation of the animals into human figures, mobile and multiple-colored images, and visuotactile associations. Isolated or combination of visual and auditory hallucinations following multi-infarct dementia with lesions involving occipitotemporal regions may occasionally occur. In most of the patients, auditory hallucinations were observed mostly after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke involving posterior parts of the cerebral hemisphere and more frequently in the right than in the left. Patients with syncope and transient cerebral hypoxia may experience visual and auditory hallucinations such as gray haze, colored patches, or bright lights consisting of rushing or roaring noises, screaming, or voices.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Traumatic brain injury is an outcome of external forces' physical or mechanical impact on the brain. Thus, the silent epidemic has complex pathophysiology affecting the brain along with extracranial or systemic complications in more than one organ system, including the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal and endocrine system which is referred to as Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome. It is driven by three interconnected mechanisms, such as systemic hyperinflammation, paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, and immunosuppression-induced sepsis. These multifaceted pathologies accelerate the risk of mortality in clinical settings by interfering with the functions of distant organs through hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, acute lung injury, neurogenic pulmonary edema, reduced gastrointestinal motility, Cushing ulcers, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, endocrine dysfunction, and many other impairments. The pharmaceutical treatment approach for this is highly specific in its mode of action and linked to various side effects, including hallucinations, seizures, anaphylaxis, teeth, bone staining, etc. Therefore, alternative natural medicine treatments are widely accepted due to their broad complementary or synergistic effects on the physiological system with minor side effects. This review is a compilation of the possible mechanisms behind the occurrence of multiorgan dysfunction and reported medicinal plants with organ protective activity that not yet been explored against traumatic brain injury and thereby highlighting the marked possibilities of their effectiveness in the management of multiorgan dysfunction. As a result, we attempted to respond to the hypothesis against using medicinal plants to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",

This chapter deals with the psychiatric aspects of trauma other than changes in cognitive function. The recognition of psychological and neurological responses to trauma is discussed first. Some of the emotional changes that can occur in reaction to physical lesions, including neurological lesions, are then considered. Lastly, specific changes in personality or mental state that can result directly from brain damage are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, whereas the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

Conclusion:Damage to the ossicular chain may seem like an unlikely injury; however, the lack of a full support system makes the ossicles inclined to damage, especially with any blunt force traumas.Sports can be an unfortunate cause for head injuries and temporal bone injuries, which can impact the structure and function of the ossicular chain.",

Neuropathic pain is a complication of injury to the peripheral or central nervous system. Although nociceptive and neuropathic pains depend on separate peripheral mechanisms, they are both significantly influenced by changes in the central nervous system function. Neuropathic pain defines the type of pain due to a disease or a lesion associated with an alteration of the function of the somatosensitive system at the level of the peripheral and/or central nervous system, in the absence of a stimulation of the nociceptors by a tissue trauma. Peripheral neuropathic pain occurs when the dysfunction affects the first neuron, while central pain is originated from dysfunctions in the central nervous system.",

Since it is now technically possible to sustain cardiac, circulatory, respiratory and other organ function after the brain has ceased to be alive; a diagnosis of death by brain criteria can be made before the heart beat stops. The diagnosis of death by brain criteria is based primarily on clinical criteria. A confirmatory laboratory test may be done to supplement the clinical diagnosis. An individual with irreversible cessation of all brain function, including the brain stem, is dead.

The relationship of anosognosia to other behavioral disorders is complex. Many authorities view the phenomenon as part of the spectrum of the neglect syndrome. Others emphasize the parallels between anosognosia and confabulatory behavior. Anosognosia also bears some resemblance to disorders of body schema such as asomatognosia or autotopagnosia. Several descriptions of anosognosia were published before Babinski coined the term in 1914 (Babinski, 1914). As introduced, anosognosia referred only to lack of awareness or recognition of a specific neurologic disturbance (i.e., hemiparesis). Subsequently, the term has been applied more broadly to describe unawareness of any neurological or neuropsychological deficit (Fisher, 1989). A wide variety of clinical syndromes have been associated with anosognosia, including visual loss (hemianopia or cortical blindness), amnesia, dementia, aphasia, cortical deafness, movement disorders (hemiballismus, chorea, tardive dyskinesia), apraxia, and thought disorders associated with schizophrenia.",

Among the known neurosurgical causes of SE are central nervous system (CNS) tumors, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), head trauma and post-operative states. Given the frequency of SE events in neurosurgical wards, it is essential that the neurosurgical teams and intensive care unit staff are adequately sensitized to the prompt detection and management of SE.

      "title": "Synaptic and Neuroglial Pathobiology in Acute and Chronic Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pathology at the molecular and cellular level is the fundamental basis of disorders that effect the brain or spinal cord of humans. A pathophysiological event can target specific molecules and groups of cells, causing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and resulting in acute and chronic neurological and behavioral disabilities ranging from memory loss to paralysis. For example, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with loss of forebrain neurons and the formation of brain lesions consisting of abnormal deposits of glial- or -neuronal generated amyloid β protein, possibly in response to gene mutations, synaptic perturbations, oxidative stress, or neuronal cytoskeletal defects (1–5). The degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with impairments in glutamate reuptake by astroglia (6,7), gene mutations in superoxide dismutase- 1 (8), and abnormal apoptosis of motor neurons that appears to be mediated by programmed cell death mechanisms (9,10). The nerve cell damage in adults and children that have experienced cardiac arrest, asphyxiation, strokes, and head or spinal cord trauma may be caused by failure of astroglial glutamate transport, excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors, abnormal activation or impaired function of intracellular signaling pathways, toxic generation of free oxygen radicals, and structural damage to target molecules within selectively vulnerable populations of neurons (11). Epidemiological studies reveal the impact that neurodegenerative disorders have on our society. For example, AD affects ~4 million adults (most are>65-yr-of-age) and is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for>100,000 deaths annually (12). ALS affects approx 30,000 Americans (4–6 people in 100,000) (13). Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized populations and is a major cause of long term neurological disability (14).",

      "abstract": "Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a frequent form of traumatic brain injury in which a clinical spectrum of in creasing injury severity is paralleled by progressively increasing amounts of axonal damage in the brain. When less severe, DAI is associated with concussive syndromes; when most severe, it causes prolonged traumatic coma that is not related to mass lesions, increased intracranial pressure, or ischemia. Pathological investigations of DAI demonstrate widespread but heterogeneous microscopic damage to axons throughout the white matter of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem. There is a propensity for injury to occur in the central third of the brain, and the corpus callosum and brain stem are especially prone to injury. In these locations, traumatic axonal damage can occur in several degrees of severity, ranging from transient disturbances of ionic homeostasis to swelling, impairment of axoplasmic transport with secondary (delayed) axotomy and primary axotomy (tearing). A more detailed understanding of the processes involved in axonal damage is crucial to the development of effective treatment for the clinical syndromes of DAI. NEUROSCIENTIST 4:202-215, 1998",

O termo transitorio e usado como demarcador de tempo, para inicio e fim da crise. A crise neonatal constitui-se a mais frequente manifestacao de disfuncao neurologica no recem-nascido, com maior incidencia no primeiro ano de vida, e apresenta risco de morte, lesao neuronal, morte neuronal, alteracoes de redes neuronais ou prejuizos neurologicos e cognitivos de longo prazo dependendo do tipo de duracao da crise. Entretanto, cerca de 40%-50% das criancas afetadas se desenvolvem normalmente. Estudos em modelos animais demonstram que as convulsoes neonatais em roedores produzem efeitos adversos neurologicos de longo prazo, tais como: deficits na aprendizagem, memoria visuo-espacial, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, comportamento autista, caracterizado pela baixa preferencia pela novidade social, deficit de discriminacao social e comportamento tipo ansioso. Com base no conjunto de alteracoes desencadeadas pelas crises neonatais em roedores, o modelo pode ser util para a investigacao da relacao entre as convulsoes no inicio do desenvolvimento e as funcoes executivas. Assim, este projeto pretende avaliar comportamentos relacionados as funcoes executivas de animais que foram expostos ao SE neonatal. Ratos Wistar machos ao nono dia de vida (P9) foram submetidos ao SE pela administracao da policarpina (350 mg/kg, ip) e os controles receberam salina 0,9% (0,1 mL/10 g). Em P60 os animais foram avaliados pelos seguintes paradigmas: a caixa de condicionamento operante e o labirinto em T. A amostra foi composta por 25 animais, 11 controles e 14 experimentais. Estes testes avaliam: aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, consolidacao da memoria, memoria de trabalho, comportamento perseverante, controle inibitorio e flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que o grupo experimental, na caixa de condicionamento operante, nao exibiu prejuizo na aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, que houve a consolidacao da memoria, nao apresentou comportamento perseverante, prejuizo na memoria de trabalho e nem comportamento perseverante. No labirinto em T o grupo experimental mantiveram preservadas a memoria de trabalho, a memoria de referencia e motivacao, e nao exibiram prejuizo na flexibilidade comportamental.

      "title": "Experimental models for the investigation of brain ischemia",
      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or also known as a head injury is one of the leading causes of death among young people and is also one of the health problems defined as impact, penetration, and rapid movement of the brain within the skull that can result in changes in mental status and is often referred to as the silent epidemic. Head injuries can also result in electrophysiological abnormalities seen on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Electroencephalography was the first clinical neurodiagnostic assessment to reveal abnormal brain function after a head injury. For detecting brain injury, EEG may be more sensitive than clinical neurologic examination. In general conditions, electroencephalography is performed on patients with moderate to severe head injuries to provide information about the severity of the head injury, and establish a diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus. This diagnosis often follows head injuries because patients with loss of consciousness are difficult to identify without an EEG examination. This also helps determine a prognosis for recovery and the likelihood of post-traumatic seizures. Electroencephalography features in head injuries depend on the severity of the injury and the location of the head itself. Electroencephalography after head injury shows slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and increasing diffuse theta slowing, which returns to normal within hours or may subside more slowly over several weeks. Electroencephalography changes are not the same in each individual, due to differences in the severity of head injuries. It is important to know that there is no clear or specific EEG for mild traumatic brain injury.",

      "title": "Self-healing hydrogel for tissue repair in the central nervous system",
      "abstract": "Neurological disorders are diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, brain tumor, and cerebrovascular diseases (stroke, migraine and other headache disorders, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and neuroinfections). Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are affected by neurological disorders. Approximately 6.2 million people die because of stroke each year; over 80% of deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries. More than 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. It is estimated that there are globally 35.6 million people with dementia with 7.7 million new cases every year. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. The prevalence of migraine is more than 10% worldwide. Therefore, repairing the damaged nervous system is one of the greatest challenges in medicine. Damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can lead to the loss of sensation, motor function, and muscle weakness, but the PNS is capable of significant spontaneous regeneration and in many cases some function can be restored. In contrast, neuronal regeneration following damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is generally unsuccessful and the injuries of CNS can cause permanent paralysis and loss of sensation. Therefore, CNS injuries present significant therapeutic challenges. Current clinical options for CNS disorder treatment, including drug delivery and rehabilitation therapy, are limited and these treatment options do not fully restore the original functions. Recently, cellular therapy has emerged as a treatment option for repair and regeneration of nerve injuries. However, transplantation of stem cells to the injured sites showed poor cell survival and engraftment (Wu et al., 2011). In this regard, the combination of functional biomaterials and cell delivery is a favorable and promising strategy for CNS repair. Biomaterials used in neural tissue engineering should meet certain criteria. For example, they should have similar mechanical properties to the nerve tissues, be able to transport nutrients and metabolites, exhibit a suitable degradation rate without inflammation occurrence, and integrate well with host tissue. Among all biomaterials, hydrogels are an ideal category of candidates and have been recently utilized in regenerative medicine. Hydrogels can serve as drug delivery platforms for biomolecular therapeutics into the CNS or as scaffolds for delivering cells to repair the injured CNS tissue (Li et al., 2012). On the other hand, the size and shape of the lesion in the CNS can vary widely depending on the site of injury. Therefore, an injectable hydrogel which can fill an irregular void is particularly well suited for treating CNS injury. However, injectable hydrogels still have some drawbacks, in particular, uncontrollable gelation kinetics. Hydrogels with rapid gelation kinetics may result in clogging of the needle during delivery. On the contrary, systems with a slow gelation process may suffer from embedded drug or cell loss or diffusion from the target sites. Compared with the traditional injectable hydrogels, self-healing hydrogels can flow and deform into liquids under excessive strain and recover back into hydrogels when higher strain is removed (Zhang et al., 2011). Because of the above mechanism, a self-healing hydrogel does not show gel fragmentation following the injection and can self-heal into a bulk gel at the target site. This superior characteristics makes self-healing hydrogels more suitable than the traditional injectable hydrogels for tissue engineering applications. Injectable hydrogels of different formulae have been used in CNS and they can be classified into naturally derived hydrogels and synthetic hydrogels. Natural polymers, such as hyaluronic acid, agarose, collagen, and chitosan, have many advantages such as good biocompatibility. They have already been directly used in clinical applications (e.g., wound sealants) and have available functional groups for further chemical modification. Literatures have indicated that chitooligosaccharide (chitosan degradation products) (Yang et al., 2009) or primary amine groups of chitosan (Ren et al., 2009) can promote neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. On the other hand, the gealtion of chitosan-based hydrogels can be controlled by pH variation. Chitosan hydrogels can also be degraded via enzymatic action. Chitosan is thus a suitable material for neural tissue engineering. The mechanical properties of hydrogels should match those of native tissue to resist in vivo forces and to maintain structural integrity. On the other hand, the modulus of hydrogels has influence on cell behaviors (Leipzig and Shoichet, 2009). The adhesion and proliferation of astrocytes were suppressed when cells were cultured on soft substrates. Besides, changing the modulus of hydrogels could direct stem cells into different lineages. For neural stem cells (NSCs), the differentiation into neuronal lineages was favored on soft scaffolds, while the oligodendrocyte differentiation was favored on stiffer scaffolds (Brännvall et al., 2007). It is thus possible to manipulate the cell lineage, proliferation, and growth of NSCs by fine-tuning the mechanical properties of hydrogels. In general, hydrogels with modulus similar to that of the nervous tissue (compressive modulus ~2.0 kPa) (Georges et al., 2006) are ideal for applications in CNS regeneration. Injectable hydrogels have been used to delivery drug to the CNS. Drug delivery by hydrogels can achieve the sustained release of bioactive molecules and promote the recovery of nerve injuries (Hoare and Kohane, 2008). In spite of the extensive studies on drug delivery by hydrogels, only one study has indicated that self-healing hydrogel as drug delivery system may hold promise for better applications in anti-tumor therapy and not focused on CNS repair. Other than drug, cells embedded in hydrogels are also used to induce neural regeneration. Injectable hydrogels encapsulating cells could promote nerve regeneration in CNS, e.g., spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke. However, the use of self-healing hydrogels (with or without cells) in CNS repair has not been reported until very recently. The injectable, self-healing hydrogel was reported for the first time to heal CNS disorders (Tseng et al., 2015). The chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel had a modulus ~1.5 kPa and a damage-healing mechanism to promote the survival and growth of neurosphere-like progenitors, as the reasonable modulus could induce the cell differentiation into neuron-like cells in vitro. Besides, choosing a right, fast, and safe preclinical model for the damaged CNS is important. Zebrafish embryos were employed to evaluate the potential of self-healing hyhrogels in CNS repair (Tseng et al., 2015). Zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate model for biomedical studies because of the large number of progeny, which greatly facilitates genetic analysis. It is relatively easy to handle and cheap to maintain in comparison to the other vertebrate research models. Besides, the embryo is transparent that facilitates the fluorescent-labeled cells for observation. Because of the above advantages, zebrafish bioassays may be a suitable preclinical model for the damaged CNS. To evaluate if the chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel with appropriate stiffness (~1.5 kPa) could heal the damaged CNS, the CNS of the developmental zebrafish embryos was destroyed by treating with 2% ethanol. Rescue of the neural deficits by various treatments was evaluated by the in-chorion coiling contraction (an index of motor function) and hatching rate (an index for CNS function) (%) of the embryos. The values were compared to those of the blank control (without ethanol treatment) to reveal the neural functional rescue by different treatments. Results showed that animals receiving NSC spheroid-laden hydrogel had the highest hatching rate (~73%), followed by those receiving NSC-laden hydrogel (~39%), and then those receiving hydrogel only (~34%). Embryos injected with phosphate-buffered saline and those of the untreated group had the lowest hatching rate. These results suggest that the self-healing hydrogel alone could partially rescue the CNS function probably because of its fast void filling ability. Besides, the self-healing hydrogel had large and interconnected pores, which may facilitate the cell metabolism and cell-cell communication. The proper microenvironment may also account for the proliferation of encapsulated NSCs (Figure 1). Chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel encapsulating neurprogenitors could further help to heal the damaged CNS and rescue the otherwise impaired neural function. Interestingly, only injection of NSC spheroids into the neural deficit embryos resulted in CNS over-growth (Figure 2). Compared to an earlier study showing that self-healing hydrogels had the ability to control long-term cancer drug delivery (de Las Heras et al., 2005), we hypothesized that the self-healing hydrogel may regulate the release of growth factor produces by NSCs and lead to normal neural development (Tseng et al., 2015).Figure 1: Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel (A) and the optical image of neural stem cell (NSC) spheroids encapsulated in the hydrogel (B).The SEM image for lyophilized hydrogel shows open and interconnected porous structure. The average pore size was mainly distributed in the range of 0.2–1.5 μm for the self-healing hydrogel. The NSC spheroids encapsulated in the self-healing hydrogel well maintained their original shape and became greater in size after 3 days. Halo was observed for each spheroid and that may allow more space for spheroid expansion.Figure 2: The appearance of zebrafish by neural stem cell (NSC) multicellular aggregate injection.Embryos were first exposed to ethanol in the medium for 4 hours to induce neural system disorder. The medium was then replaced with fresh normal medium following injection of NSC aggregates. After the treatment, the neural deficit embryos resulted in central nervous system over-growth. Injection of NSC aggregates encapsulated in self-healing hydrogel showed normal development of zebrafish.Using injectable hydrogels, and especially injectable, self-healing hydrogels, for local and controlled cell delivery to CNS is a fast and new expanding discipline of regenerative medicine. A multitude of molecular and NSC therapeutics can be combined with hydrogels to repair injured CNS. In this status review, we have highlighted the chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel with CNS repair efficacy which was supported by the zebrafish model. The chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel is nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible (de Las Heras et al., 2005). NSC spheroids within chitosan-based self-healing hydrogel are able to differentiate into neurons and glial cells as a potential cellular source for neural regeneration. The zebrafish neural injury model may be used to screen potential biomaterials for applications in CNS related diseases. With the recent advances, we expect new smart materials that can respond to changes in external stimuli such as shear, temperature, pH, and specific ligands will be developed in the near future to provide exciting possibilities to repair CNS related diseases in the next ten years.",

      "title": "Simple Partial Seizure",
      "abstract": "A seizure is a symptom that refers to episodic, excessive, and disorderly neuronal activity in the brain. Traditionally seizures have been classified into and generalized. Partial seizure refers to abnormal neural activity localized to one area of the cerebral hemisphere and having a discernible or localized onset. When there is no associated impairment in consciousness, it is called a simple seizure, and when it is associated with impairment in consciousness, it is called a complex seizure. When a seizure becomes generalized, it is referred to as a partial seizure with secondary generalization. New terminology for a simple seizure is focal onset aware seizure.Partial seizures are the most common type of seizures in patients with epilepsy. Complex seizures occur more often than simple seizures, although most complex seizures start as simple seizures.Patients with simple seizures remain awake and aware throughout the seizure, and some patients can even talk during the episode. It may be difficult to distinguish them from complex seizures in infants and patients with cognitive and speech difficulties, as impairment in consciousness can be difficult to assess in these patients.The term aura refers to signs and symptoms that occur with a seizure before consciousness is lost and for which memory is intact afterward. Auras that are not followed by seizure should be considered aware seizures or simple seizures.Depending on clinical signs, symptoms, and EEG localization, seizures can be further subdivided into four types: Focal motor seizures Focal sensory seizures Autonomic seizures Psychological seizures Focal Motor Seizures The or motor seizure occurs due to an epileptogenic lesion on the contralateral frontal lobe. Motor symptoms constitute the primary clinical manifestation. Typically, consciousness is not impaired in seizures of discrete motor areas. They usually originate from the supplementary motor area and cause turning movements of the head and neck to the opposite side and sometimes tonic contractions of the limbs and trunk on the same side. This may or may not be followed by generalized clonic movements. Subdivisions of ictal motor symptoms include elementary (tonic, clonic, dystonic, versive) and automatism (coordinated, repetitive motor activity like lip-smacking, tapping, and swallowing). Another classification based on clinical symptomatology uses the terms like clonic, tonic, or versive seizures.Focal motor seizures are more common on the face, hands, and toes because these areas have disproportionately large cortical representations. The excitatory focus is usually around the rolandic (motor) cortex. If there are accompanying sensory symptoms, the focus may be on post-rolandic convolution. Temporal lobe origin seizures sometimes have head-turning movements on the same side followed by the forceful contraversive turning of the head and body. Clonic seizures refer to repeated, short contractions of various muscle groups characterized by twitching movements or rhythmic jerking that recur at regular intervals of less than 1 to 2 seconds. These seizures are brief, lasting less than one to two minutes. In clonic seizures, there is epileptic activation of a restricted area of the precentral gyrus. Tonic seizures refer to sustained contractions that last for more than 5 to 10 seconds and result in the posturing of the limbs and whole body. Focal tonic seizures refer to tonic contractions restricted to a part of the body on one side. Focal tonic seizures are attributed to activation of Brodmann area 6, particularly the mesial frontal region. There may be some involvement of the premotor areas in some cases. Versive seizures consist of sustained, forceful, involuntary turning of head and eyes to one side due to tonic contraction of head and eye muscles. Usually, they are accompanied by loss of consciousness, but occasionally patients may be aware of the forced involuntary eye and head-turning. The version can result from seizures originating from various locations and spreading to the premotor cortex. Following convulsions with predominant motor symptoms, patients may have transient, functional, and localized paralysis of the affected limbs. This is known as Todd paralysis and can last minutes to hours, usually in proportion to the duration of the convulsion. This postepileptic paralysis occurs due to persistent dysfunction of the affected epileptogenic area and is the signature of a seizure. It has significant clinical value in lateralizing the hemisphere of seizure onset. Jacksonian March Seizure Jacksonian march seizure starts with tonic contractions in one hand or on one side of the face or the muscles of one foot. This is followed by clonic movements in these parts and sometimes a series of clonic movements with increasing frequency that builds up to a tonic contraction. These movements may spread (march) from the muscles affected to the other muscles on the same side of the body. In classic Jacksonian march, the seizure spreads from hand to arm to face and then down the leg ipsilaterally, or if it started in the foot, then seizure marches up the leg, down the arm, and then to the face. This typically happens over a short time (20 to 30 seconds). There can be other associated symptoms like automatism (lip smacking or tapping movements), hallucinations, muscle cramping, head-turning, etc. Symptoms are usually mild. These seizures rarely become generalized, and typically consciousness remains intact. Jacksonian march seizure can be mistaken for a transient ischemic attack, migraine, or other condition. Focal Somatosensory Seizures Sensory seizures present as numbness, tingling, crawling sensation, pins and needles feeling, and rarely, as pain or thermal sensations. They can be or can march to other ipsilateral body parts and usually have a focus in or around post-rolandic convolution of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Visual seizures are rare but have localizing significance. Visual hallucinations and visual loss are typical of occipital lobe epilepsy but sometimes can occur with seizure foci in anteromedial temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Auditory hallucinations are a rare initial manifestation of seizure and have sometimes been noted with lesions in the posterior temporal lobe on one side. Olfactory hallucinations often occur with a lesion in the inferior and medial parts of the temporal lobe. Gustatory hallucinations can occur in temporal lobe disease with lesions in the insula and parietal operculum. Autonomic Seizures Autonomic seizures manifest with predominantly altered autonomic function. Some common autonomic signs and symptoms include diaphoresis, shivering, piloerection, a rising sensation in epigastrium, nausea, changes in blood pressure and heart rate (commonly tachycardia), and pupillary changes. Autonomic features are common in several nonepileptic conditions, making autonomic seizures harder to diagnose.Some specific epilepsy syndromes with prominent autonomic features include neonatal seizures, epilepsy of infancy with migrating seizures, Dravet syndrome, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and early-onset benign occipital epilepsy. Psychological Seizures Psychological seizures manifest with affective and cognitive symptoms like memory flashbacks, dream-like events, Deja Vu feeling, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, and uncontrolled laughter or crying. They arise commonly from the temporal area rather than the extratemporal.",

Neurocognitive impairment is multifactorial in chronic kidney disease. End-stage kidney disease and the actual process of dialysis can potentiate cerebral vascular changes including volume and electrolyte shifts and related dialysis disequilibrium. Cognitive testing is an important component of the clinical assessment to corroborate the history.

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

In these cases, the initial symptoms became manifest either during or immediately subsequent to some severe emotional disturbance or psychic trauma and the objective neurologic signs were at first minimal. As a result, the symptoms were attributed to emotional causes and only later after the objective neurologic signs had progressed was the correct diagnosis established. The possible role of the emotional disturbances as an etiological factor in the production of the structural changes is discussed. It is suggested that the emotional trauma precipitates both physiologic and psychologic alterations which lead to the appearance of objective neurologic signs.",

Because of its low incidence, it is a challenging diagnosis, going in differential diagnosis with other acute CNS diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epilepsy, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The most common clinical features are cortical blindness, focal neurological deficits, cortical signs, altered mental status, headache, and seizures. Prognosis is generally favorable with complete recovery within days, but even rarer cases of persistent neurological deficits have been described. We present a case of persistent CIE after contrast administration to perform a coronary angiography. Following the procedure, the patient experienced left hemiplegia, complete visual deficit, left hemineglect and psychomotor agitation. An emergency angio-computed tomography brain scan showed no occlusion of large vessels or intracranial bleeding. A following brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed small diffusion-restricted areas in the right peritrigonal region and the right cortico-subcortical posterior frontal and parietal region. At the discharge, alertness was recovered but there was a persistent left upper limb paresis. At the 6th months follow-up, the patient was functionally autonomous without focal deficits.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Cognitive deficits are a key feature of schizophrenia and a primary cause of long-term disability. Current neurophysiological models of schizophrenia focus on distributed brain dysfunction with bottom-up as well as top-down components. Bottom-up deficits in cognitive processing are driven by impairments in basic perceptual processes that localize to primary sensory brain regions. Within the auditory system, deficits are apparent in elemental sensory processing, such as tone matching following brief delay. Such deficits lead to impairments in higher-order processes such as phonological processing and auditory emotion recognition. Within the visual system, deficits are apparent in functioning of the magnocellular visual pathway, leading to higher-order deficits in processes such as perceptual closure, object recognition, and reading. In both auditory and visual systems, patterns of deficit are consistent with underlying impairment of brain N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor systems.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life-threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured-individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

Common etiologies of symptomatic seizures include central nervous system (CNS) infections, inflammation, hypoxia, stroke, electrolyte/metabolic disturbances, toxins, trauma, neoplasm, and fever (i.e., febrile seizure). History and physical examination are critical to determining the underlying cause for the seizure and choosing appropriate therapies. Directed diagnostic studies vary by circumstance and may include neuroimaging, lumbar puncture, EEG, or laboratory studies.

Prophylactic neuroprotection during anesthesia and surgery is also discussed.

These and other beliefs may influence directly or indirectly on the recovery process and the expectations placed on it by the families and patients. Conclusions. Provide accurate, clear and honest information, at the right time, helps patients and their families to better understand the deficits, the course of recovery and to adapt to the new reality resulting from a traumatic brain injury.

End neuromas are the result of an amputation or are found at the proximal stump in a complete nerve transection or rupture. Neuromas-in-continuity follows traction or compression injury and may complicate repair of a nerve transection or rupture. Symptomatic neuromas should be assessed and treated by a peripheral nerve surgeon working within a multi-professional team. The objectives of the initial treatment should encompass pain management, psychological support and physical therapies with the aim of restoration of normal nerve response thresholds to afferent stimuli and optimisation of the perineuroma environment. Surgical intervention should be reserved for non-responders and in cases where reconstruction of nerve function is deemed essential for useful functional recovery and pain resolution.",

Fibromyalgia is a rheumatoid syndrome of unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain and generalized muscular tenderness. An intimate link between pain, mood, and sleep is apparent. Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a condition of unknown etiology characterized by fatigue that persists for more than 6 months and presents with several of the following symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, pharyngitis, tender lymph nodes, non-restorative sleep, and malaise after physical exertion that extends beyond 24 hour.",

Spontaneous and reflex movements originating from the spinal cord neurons may occur in brain-dead patients.

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "Brain death is at present the accepted criterion to establish the diagnosis of death in all medical aspects and in public opinion. It implies the irreversible destruction of the brain with associated loss of spontaneous breathing and persistent cardiac rhythm. Brain death forms the basis of the Uniform Death Determination Act. Brain death may follow head trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, child abuse or chocking. In 1959, the concept of coma depasse (irreversible coma) was introduced based on 23 cases with loss of consciousness, of brain stem reflexes, spontaneous breathing, isoelectric EEG, and massive necrosis of the brain, all of which led to define the concept of irreversible coma as brain death. Due to clinical similarities the locked-in syndrome, GuillainBarre-Strohl peripheral neuropathy, accidental hypothermia, alcoholic intoxication, overdose of anesthetics, barbiturates, addictive drugs, antidepressants, and trauma must be considered in the differential diagnoses prior to diagnosis of brain death. The brain energetic requirements to maintain normal function depend on the constant flow of oxygen and glucose. Blood flow, blood perfusion pressure, intracranial pressure, blood viscosity, vascular resistance, and capillary density, are also participant factors. In cardiac arrest the oxygen drops to zero level with ensuing global brain death. Oxygen deficit in atmospheric air leading to hypoxia, induces brain lesions of varied topography obeying level of neuronal activity, intensity and duration of the hypoxia. Brain areas susceptible to oxygen and glucose deficits include the hippocampal pyramidal layer, neocortical layers3, 4, 5, cerebellar Purkinje and granular layers, Globus pallidus, and subcortical white matter. The peculiar susceptibility of brain areas to damage by hypoxia is based on the theory of pathoclisis or selective” topistic” vulnerability. Neuronal necrosis in ischemic hypoxia is due to glutamate excitotoxicity acting upon NMDA, AMPA, kainate and metabotropic receptors. Besides neuronal necrosis, programmed cell death also occurs, it is a morphological change named apoptosis. It occurs in sequential stages beginning by cell shrinkage, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation, cytoplasm surface blebbing and extrusion of membrane bound apoptotic bodies. Cascading molecular events to apoptosis include signaling pathways to initiate apoptosis, control and integration, a common-execution phase, and removal of dead cells by phagocytosis. Mitochondrial permeability to release cytochrome c an apoptotic trigger into the cytosol, and gene participation ensue. Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, BclX, Apaf-1, p53; all are genes encoding proteins that may exert pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic actions. Conclusion: In clinical practice, in order to avoid any doubts, confirmatory laboratory tests are required as proof of the clinical diagnosis of brain death, which once firmly established leads to declare that the patient is dead, followed by unplugging mechanical ventilation. All of this must be in agreement with the bioethical, legal, and religious regulations and family consent.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection.

      "abstract": "An illustrative case of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) emphasizes features that help to separate focal outer head trauma owing to blows and/or falls from angular acceleration head injuries associated with diffuse inner brain lesions. In the past, explaining significant neurological deficits and death as the result of diffuse closed head trauma received from high-speed automobile accidents has been difficult as well as confusing. The long-term consequences from such diffuse inner cerebral trauma are still poorly defined. Head injuries sustained in automobile accidents have been associated with diffuse brain damage characterized by axonal injury at the moment of impact. The reported victim of a motor vehicle accident showed post-mortem findings for both inner cerebral trauma and focal outer cerebral damage. The diffuse degeneration of cerebral white matter is associated with sagittal and lateral acceleration with centroaxial trauma and has a different pathogenesis from outer focal head trauma, typified by subdural hematomas and coup injuries. Unlike outer cerebral injury, over 50 percent of victims with diffuse axonal injury die within two weeks. These individuals characteristically have no lucid interval and remain unconscious, vegetative, or severely disabled until death. Compared to head trauma victims without diffuse axonal injury, there is a lower incidence of skull fractures, subdural hemorrhages, or other intracranial mass effect as well as outer brain contusions. Primary brainstem injuries often demonstrated at autopsy are seen in the reported victim. Diffuse axonal injury is produced by various angles of acceleration with prolonged acceleration/deceleration usually accompanying traffic accidents. Less severe diffuse axonal injury causes concussion.",

They herald a high rate of future lobar intracerebral hemorrhage, making it imperative to differentiate them from TIAs to avoid potentially dangerous use of antithrombotic drugs. Cortical spreading depression or depolarization triggered by acute or chronic superficial brain bleeding, a contributor to brain injury in other neurologic diseases, may be the underlying mechanism. This review discusses diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of CAA-related TFNEs.",

Este sindrome se considera dentro del extremo del Sindrome Apatico o Sindrome frontalcingular y suele ser secundario a lesiones en el giro cingulado de ambos hemisferios o despues de un dano bilateral en los lobulos frontales. El diagnostico representa un reto para los clinicos ya que suele confundirse con algun tipo de afasia, apraxia o estados de alteracion de la conciencia. Los estudios han sido muy lentos y escasos, por lo que apenas se ha podido caracterizar a la enfermedad y no se han establecido pautas para su evaluacion e intervencion. El presente estudio expone el caso de un paciente con mutismo acinetico causado por un Evento Vascular Cerebral frontal bilateral, en el cual se le otorga relevancia principal a las pautas de evaluacion neuropsicologica asi como a su abordaje neuropsicologico. Los resultados sugieren que las pruebas estandarizadas son utiles para conocer el perfil cognitivo del paciente, sin embargo, se recomienda que la evaluacion se complemente a traves de la observacion y la recopilacion de datos de familiares y cuidadores; y la intervencion que sea realice sea integral y personalizada, especifica a las necesidades, etiologia y a comorbilidades presentadas por el paciente, teniendo en cuenta que el objetivo principal es permitirle alcanzar un nivel optimo de bienestar y mejorar la calidad de vida.",

In comatose patients showing general clinical signs of brain stem injury, neurological examination is directed towards brain stem reflexes which may indicate the anatomical level of the lesion. At the same time, brain stem reflexes, as the integral part of the total clinical picture immediately after injury, may be used as one of the factors for early prognosis. Generally speaking, the level of intracranial pressure, motor postural reflexes, and brain stem reflexes almost always provide a forecast of the results of severe craniocerebral injuries and particularly brain stem injuries (primary and secondary).",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

This type of condition can be classified into several subtypes, and the aforementioned ischemic optic neuropathy (NOI) is just one specific example. Optic neuritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision loss. This condition can affect one or both optic nerves and comes in several forms, two of which are the most common: retrobulbar optic neuritis and papillary optic neuritis.

      "abstract": "Parestesia adalah kondisi timbulnya sensasi pada kulit yang abnormal seperti kesemutan, gatal atau mati rasa, tanpa penyebab yang jelas. Kondisi ini bisa terjadi hanya sementara atau dalam jangka waktu yang lama (kronis).Parestesia dapat bersifat sementara (temporer) atau bersifat kronis. Hampir setiap orang pernah mengalami parestesia temporer. Sensasi ini muncul ketika saraf tertekan secara tidak sengaja pada posisi tubuh tertentu, seperti duduk bersila terlalu lama atau tidur dengan kepala menindih tangan. Parestesia temporer akan hilang dengan sendirinya ketika tekanan pada saraf dihilangkan. Namun, jika rasa kesemutan tetap ada meskipun tekanan sudah dihilangkan, maka kemungkinan ada penyakit atau gangguan lain dalam tubuh yang menjadi penyebabnya Parestesia yang bersifat kronis seringkali merupakan gejala dari suatu penyakit saraf atau disebabkan oleh trauma pada jaringan saraf. Berbagai macam penyakit dapat menyebabkan parestesia kronis termasuk kekurangan vitamin, gangguan pada saraf akibat gerakan yang berulang atau penyakit lain. Parestesia kronis membutuhkan pengobatan dan penanganan untuk sembuh. Namun, terkadang parestesia kronis tidak bisa benar-benar sembuh bahkan setelah menjalani pengobatan sekalipun Sistem pakar (expert system) adalah sistem yang berbasis komputer yang menggunakan pengetahuan, fakta, dan teknik penalaran dalam memecahkan masalah yang biasanya hanya dapat dipecahkan oleh seorang.Bagi para ahli sistem pakar juga membantu aktivitasnya sebagai asisten yang sangat berpengalaman.Sistem pakar juga dapat memberikan penganalisaan terhadap masalah dan juga dapat merekomendasikan pada penguna beberapa tindakan untuk melakukan perbaikan",

      "title": "What is the Relationship of Traumatic Brain Injury to Dementia?",
      "abstract": "There is a long history linking traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the development of dementia. Despite significant reservations, such as recall bias or concluding causality for TBI, a summary of recent research points to several conclusions on the TBI-dementia relationship. 1) Increasing severity o f a single moderate-to-severe TBI increases the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. 2) Repetitive, often subconcussive, mild TBIs increases the risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative neuropathology. 3) TBI may be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative disorders that can be associated with dementia. 4) TBI appears to lower the age of onset of TBI-related neurocognitive syndromes, potentially adding \"TBI cognitive-behavioral features\". The literature further indicates several specific risk factors for TBI-associated dementia: 5) any blast or blunt physical force to the head as long as there is violent head displacement; 6) decreased cognitive and/or neuronal reserve and the related variable of older age at TBI; and 7) the presence of apolipoprotein E ɛ4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD. Finally, there are neuropathological features relating TBI with neurocognitive syndromes: 8) acute TBI results in amyloid pathology and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies; 9) CTE shares features with neurodegenerative dementias; and 10) TBI results in white matter tract and neural network disruptions. Although further research is needed, these ten findings suggest that dose-dependent effects of violent head displacement in vulnerable brains predispose to dementia; among several potential mechanisms is the propagation of abnormal proteins along damaged white matter networks.",

      "title": "ROLE OF ACROLEIN IN NEUROTRAUMA AND RELATED NEURODEGENERATION",
      "abstract": "Neurotrauma is a general term describing injury to the central nervous system (CNS); which comprises of the brain and spinal cord. The damage resulting from neurotrauma includes primary injury, which occurs from different sources such as compressed air hitting the brain (bTBI) or an object/bone contusing the spinal cord, resulting in a spinal cord injury (SCI). These various means of primary brain and spinal cord injury are further complicated by the many possible combinations of severity levels and frequencies. However, primary injuries are regarded in many cases as unavoidable with the immediate nerve damage being largely irreversible. Despite all this, primary injuries of the CNS are related by common biochemical pathways in secondary injury. Secondary injury is the cause of declining outcomes after neurotrauma and poor recovery. Secondary injury begins immediately after primary injury and can continue to trigger death of neurons for years later. Given this contribution to poor recovery and its slow progression, secondary injury provides an excellent window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. A major factor and key link in secondary injury and its perpetuation is reactive aldehyde formation, such as acrolein, from lipid peroxidation. The common formation of acrolein in neurotrauma is attributed to the unique structure of the CNS: with neurons containing a high lipid content from myelin and heavy metabolic activity they are vulnerable to acrolein formation. Thus, acrolein in secondary injury is a point of pathogenic convergence between the various forms of neurotrauma, and may play a role as well in the development of neurotrauma linked disorders and related neurodegeneration. The overall goal of this thesis is to therefore develop better strategies for acrolein removal. We explore here endogenous clearance strategies and targeted drug delivery in SCI, investigate detailed cellular structure changes in bTBI, and acrolein formation and removal in Parkinson’s disease. These findings of pathology, and effectiveness of new or existing acrolein removal strategies, will allow us to better employ treatments in future studies.",

      "abstract": "Syncope, defined as a transient loss of consciousness due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery, is a frequent symptom and can be attributed to different causes.1\n\nThe most common aetiology of syncope is a neurally mediated reflex that consists of a transient failure of the cardiovascular mechanisms that normally control haemodynamic stability. This reflex is usually triggered by different stimuli (afferent pathways), leading to sudden withdrawal of sympathetic activity and to an increase in parasympathetic nerve tone (efferent pathways), causing vasodilatation, with consequent hypotension, and bradycardia.\n\nThe clinical presentation of neurally mediated syncope is not usually uniform; however, it may manifest with different patterns. In some patients, it is initiated by clear adrenergic stimuli such as fear, pain, emotional distress, or medical instrumentation, whereas in others it develops after prolonged orthostatism, hypovolaemia, or carotid sinus stimuli. There are also many patients in whom reflex syncope develops without any apparent recognizable trigger. On the other hand, some patients complain of typical vegetative prodrome, whereas others develop sudden syncope without any warning symptom. In addition, although both mechanisms, hypotension and bradycardia, are, by definition, always present, the predominance of one or the other leads to the characteristic patterns of vasodepressor, mixed, or cardioinhibitory reflex syncope.2 Although all these situations share a common underlying mechanism, i.e. hypotension and bradycardia triggered by some afferent stimuli, these differences have a great impact on the diagnostic process and in therapeutic decisions. Whereas a syncopal episode in a young patient, with clear triggers and prodrome, is easy to diagnose and manage, sudden episodes, without recognizable triggers, particularly … \n\n*Corresponding author.

The severity of the phenotype is dependent on the degree of cerebral insult, extent of subsequent injury incurred; with some correlation with outcome [1–4]. Because of the wide variety and often changing signs and symptoms post HI, coupled with the numerous co-morbid metabolic and systemic problems and the frequent occurrence of seizures which can be very difficult to differentiate clinically, this article will concentrate solely on describing the hyperkinetic non-epileptic movement disorder observed following transient HI in the term newborn.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Death in patients with epilepsy may occur suddenly and unexpectedly. When no anatomic or chemically demonstrable cause for such a death is found at postmortem examination, the death may remain unexplained. Previous studies of general autopsy features in cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) have reported increased lung and liver weights, pulmonary edema, hepatic fatty change, and small increases in heart weights. Neuropathologic findings include cerebral edema, lighter brain weights compared with agematched controls, and various other structural brain lesions in 34% to almost 50% of cases. In an ongoing United Kingdom study, brains from 25 cases of SUDEP have been examined. Macroscopic abnormalities were identified in 70% of cases and included contusions, old infarcts, hippocampal sclerosis, cortical dysgenesis, vascular malformation, oligodendroglioma, neurodegenerative brain disease, and microcephaly. Histopathologic findings include evidence of acute neocortical and brainstem hypoxic neuronal changes. Similar changes in hippocampal and basal ganglia neurones have also been observed. These changes indicate a cerebral event occurring at least 4–6 h before death and are at odds with a “sudden” death which, by definition, occurs within 1 h. Because many SUDEP cases are unwitnessed, the exact time sequence of events is often unknown. This study confirms the high incidence of structural brain lesions in SUDEP cases.",

      "title": "Silent Stroke -a Drag on Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "A stroke is a condition because of something blocking blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts disrupting the blood supply to a particular portion of the brain. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die, manifesting as lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Symptoms include dizziness, numbness, weakness on one side of the body, and problems with talking, writing, or understanding language. Most of us have heard or seen of a case of a stroke, with symptoms like slurred speech, loss of balance, difficulty speaking, and so on - but not many know that one can have a stroke without even knowing it? known as a silent stroke or Mini-stroke or asymptomatic cerebral infarction. A silent stroke refers to a stroke that doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms. It is recognized by a brain (CT scan or an MRI) imaging that will show white spots or lesions where your brain cells have stopped functioning. Brain scans can detect one or multiple silent strokes. Most silent strokes are caused by a clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain. The blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching that area, causing nearby brain cells to die. While in the middle-aged people with no apparent signs of stroke about 10% have brain damage from one and this rate increases to 25% among people over 80 years. The damage that happens is permanent, but therapy might help stimulate other parts of the brain so you regain abilities that may have weakened. Common Silent Stroke Symptoms include sudden lack of balance, temporary loss of basic muscle movement slight memory loss and sudden changes in mood or personality and issues with cognitive skills and ability. As different parts of our brain control different parts of our body, our symptoms will depend on the part of our brain affected and the extent of the damage but usually begin suddenly. Therefore, it is critical to seek diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. The chances of getting a stroke go up among elderly, diabetes, hypertensives, persons with heart disease, vascular disease, or atrial fibrillation. The management of silent strokes involves prescribing medications for blood thinning, to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and serum cholesterol medications to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The significant burden of stroke on the mortality rates in India, is well-documented, but robust data regarding the aggregates of evidence on the quality of life (QOL) of stroke survivors is limited. Therefore, it is critical to seek diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Material &amp; Methods: This manuscript is based on a real case study in last 15 months. Chidambar a male of 70 years with history of Diabetes for over 15 years and Hypertension for 10 years, both poorly controlled. He had left sided hemiparesis following a stroke in January 2022, that resulted in left sided hemiparesis, speech, and cognitive signs. Since early 2023 he is suffering frequent falls, vomiting, urinary incontinence, changing moods and worsening memory and dementia indicative recurrent silent strokes, that have worsened his quality of life.

Nach einer Kortikosteroidtherapie bildeten sich die Symptome vollständig zurück. Ergebnis: Der vorliegende Fall zeigt, dass bei Auftreten einer Psychose in Kombination mit einem demenziellen Syndrom und weiteren neurologischen Symptomen auch an eine Hashimoto-Enzephalopathie gedacht werden und dann eine Abgrenzung zur Lewy-Body-Demenz und zur Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Erkrankung erfolgen sollte.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Objective Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is a common complication of severe systemic illness treated in intensive care medicine. Ischemic stroke leads to an acute critical injury of the brain with hemiparesis, immunosuppression and subsequent infections, all of which require extended medical treatment. Stroke-induced sarcopenia further contributes to poor rehabilitation and is characterized by muscle wasting and denervation in the paralytic, but also the unaffected limbs. Therefore, we asked whether stroke leads to an additional CIP-like neurodegeneration. Results Focal brain ischemia was induced in adult mice by 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) following reperfusion and led to functional deficits and marked hemispheric brain atrophy. Nerve conduction function and muscle potentials were measured in the ipsilateral sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscle with electroneurography/-myography on days 10, 22, 44 after stroke. An additional crush-injury to the sciatic nerve was included in two sham mice as positive control (sham+). We found no differences in nerve conduction function nor spontaneous electromyographic activity between MCAo and sham animals. Sham + mice developed marked reduction of the motor action potential amplitudes and conduction velocities with pathologic spontaneous activity.",

Banyak pasien yang tidak menyadari adanya gejala epilepsi dalam dirinya. Epilepsi dapat juga diartikan sebagai gangguan susunan saraf pusat (SSP) yang dicirikan oleh terjadinya serangan (seizure, fit, attack, spell) yang bersifat spontan (unprovoked) dan berkala. Serangan dapat diartikan sebagai modifikasi fungsi otak yang bersifat mendadak dan sepintas, yang berasal dari sekelompok besar sel-sel otak, bersifat sinkron dan berirama. Istilah epilepsi tidak boleh digunakan untuk serangan yang terjadi hanya sekali saja, serangan yang terjadi selama penyakit akut berlangsung, dan occasional provoked seizures misalnya kejang atau serangan pada hipoglikemi. Penyakit epilepsi dapat dicegah secara optimal apabila gejala epilepsi dapat dideteksi sejak dini dan kemudian dilakukan penanganan yang tepat dan intensif. Akan tetapi terkadang pengetahuan masyarakat mengenai gangguan epilepsi ini masih sangat terbatas. Oleh karena itu diperlukan sistem yang bisa memprediksi tipe dan manifestasi serangan epilepsi yang diderita oleh seseorang. Dalam penelitian ini, akan dilakukan perancangan sistem yang dapat digunakan untuk melakukan deteksi dini terhadap tipe dan manifestasi serangan penyakit epilepsi berikut cara pencegahan dengan menggunakan sistem pakar.

      "title": "Cocaine Addiction as a Neurological Disorder: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinical and preclinical studies provide convincing evidence for persistent neurological/psychiatric impairments and possible neuronal degeneration associated with chronic cocaine/stimulant abuse. These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

      "abstract": "As effects of excitement may be noted—( a ) those which are transitory, occurring during the excitement, and (b) those which persist. As transitory effects there may be an apparently general hypermnesia, in which there is a marked freshening of all memories, or there may be a selective hypermnesia, where certain rather narrow lines of association are followed. The lasting effects may be hypermnesia, hypomnesia, or total amnesia for events experienced during the excitement. The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life.

      "abstract": "Seizures are either focal (partial) or generalized in onset (Table I).1 The manifestation of the seizure is related to the area of the brain involved in the initial electrical seizure discharge. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

Attacks present with repeated, severe, sharp, stabbing, or throbbing pain. Patients may experience a single attack, recurrent attacks with pain-free interictal periods, or a sawtooth pattern background pain with superimposed stabs.1,2 Although SUNCT typically presents as a primary headache disorder, it may be secondary to an underlying pathology, such as pituitary tumors or posterior fossa lesions, both intra and extra-axial (vascular lesion, tumor, or bony abnormalities). Multiple Myeloma (MM) with central nervous system involvement (CNS MM) most commonly presents with visual changes (36%), radiculopathy (27%), headache (25%), confusion (21%), dizziness (7%) and seizures (6%).3,4 Secondary SUNCT cases have been sparsely described (less than 60), and CNS MM presenting as SUNCT has not been previously described in the literature.2,5 Our case describes a previously unreported clinical presentation of CNS MM. The report highlights the need for a timely and thorough diagnostic work-up of headache in patients with risk factors for a secondary etiology, which in this case included new-onset, autonomic features, older age, and history of malignancy. A misdiagnosis will preclude a potentially life-extending or saving targeted therapy for the underlying illness. We also aim to remind practitioners of the variability in the clinical symptoms of SUNCT, which are known to occur in a significant number of cases, including migrainous features and dull interictal pain.",

The memory disturbance was significant compared with the patient's intact orientation and normal intelligence. In the category of memory, recent memory was more markedly disturbed than the immediate or remote memory. From the viewpoint of the lesion, the memory disturbance was more severe when, in addition to the hippocampus, the entorhinal gyrus or amygdala was damaged. The visual memory disturbance was mild and no difference was observed in the verbal or visual memory according to whether the lesion was right or left. The memory disturbance was usually transient and marked improvement was observed in some cases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3.

      "abstract": "Vision loss due to ocular diseases such as glaucoma, optic neuropathy, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy, are generally considered an exclusive affair of the retina and/or optic nerve.However, the brain, through multiple indirect influences, has also a major impact on functional visual impairment.Such indirect influences include intracerebral pressure, eye movements, top-down modulation (attention, cognition), and emotionally triggered stress hormone release affecting blood vessel dysregulation.Therefore, vision loss should be viewed as the result of multiple interactions within a \"brain-eye-vascular triad\", and several eye diseases may also be considered as brain diseases in disguise.While the brain is part of the problem, it can also be part of the solution.Neuronal networks of the brain can \"amplify\" residual vision through neuroplasticity changes of local and global functional connectivity by activating, modulating and strengthening residual visual signals.The activation of residual vision can be achieved by different means such as vision restoration training, non-invasive brain stimulation, or blood flow enhancing medications.Modulating brain functional networks and improving vascular regulation may offer new opportunities to recover or restore low vision by increasing visual field size, visual acuity and overall functional vision.Hence, neuroscience offers new insights to better understand vision loss, and modulating brain and vascular function is a promising source for new opportunities to activate residual vision to achieve restoration and recovery to improve quality of live in patients suffering from low vision.",

      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

Muscle fatigue is the cardinal symptom of MG. Respiratory muscle weakness and breathing problems are manifestations of MG even in mild stages of the disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Also sleep related conditions are among the manifestations of MG which include sleep disordered breathing (SDB) [i.e. central (CSA) and obstructive (OSA) sleep apneas, hypoventilation or hypoxemic syndromes], reduced sleep efficiency and quality, increased number of nocturnal awakenings, excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced rapid eye movement sleep and altered sleep perception and dreaming. On the other hand, sleep abnormalities may result in lack of concentration, cognitive impairments and mood disturbances as depression and anxiety. Central and peripheral mechanisms have been suggested for the association between MG and central nervous system manifestations and sleep abnormalities. Neurologists and sleep medicine professionals should be aware of the associations between OSA/CSA, hypoventilation and other sleep related conditions with MG and consider systematic investigations including polysomnography and ventilatory support. This will reduce morbidity and mortality and improve quality of lives of patients with MG.",

      "title": "An improved understanding of neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain represents a series of relatively uncommon chronic pain conditions, caused by lesions or dysfunctions of peripheral or central afferent pathways in the nervous system. The symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain can all be explained by a neuronal hyperexcitability at the site of the nerve lesion, which subsequently and in a dynamic fashion recruits more central sites. The manifestations of such neuronal hyperexcitability are therefore rather similar, irrespective of the causes or sites of the lesions. The key findings in neuropathic pain are: (a) pain in an area with sensory loss; (b) positive sensory symptoms such as dysesthaesia and allodynia in the injured area, where sensory discrimination is abolished; and (c) an abnormal sympathetic activity. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability has increased dramatically within the last decade, and accordingly, it has been suggested that pain be classified according to a mechanism‐based approach. The challenge for an improved understanding of neuropathic pain—which is the key for better treatment—lies in elucidating the relationships between symptoms, signs, aetiology, anatomical lesions, and underlying mechanisms. At present, this is not a trivial task. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

      "title": "Differing roles for parvalbumin neurons after nerve injury",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is abnormal, persistent pain that is caused by injury to the somatosensory system. It commonly involves damage to the peripheral nerves as a result of physical trauma, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, infections such as HIV or shingles, or toxicity induced neuropathies as a result of cancer treatments. Neuropathic pain is common, with epidemiological studies suggesting that around 18–30% of American, European and Australian adults suffer from chronic pain. This leads to significant disabilities and suffering. People with chronic pain complain of spontaneous pains that may be electric-shock like or continuous. Often coexisting with these are abnormal, evoked sensations such as tactile allodynia (pain in response to innocuous stimuli e.g., light brush or pressure) and cold allodynia (pain in response to innocuous cooling), or hyperalgesia (increase pain in response to an already noxious stimulus), as well as ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. The management of these conditions is often suboptimal for two main reasons: firstly, an incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that are involved (and which of them are the most important). Secondly, patients often have compliance issues with pharmacological medications (Attal, 2012). Both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology and since the turn of the century particular emphasis has focussed on the role of glial cells in pain (West et al., 2015). Primary sensory afferents convey information about peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). Their cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and constitute a heterogeneous population that has been classified in several ways. Initially, they were split into the small dark and large light groups based on neurofilament (and myelination) content that correlated well with conduction velocities. With the advent of immunohistochemistry, and the discovery of different trophic factors, these groups were further subdivided into peptide-rich and peptide-poor nociceptors, low threshold mechanoreceptor and proprioceptor subgroups (Scott, 1992). Moreover, it is now known that different DRG neurons can express in > 30 different neurotransmitters or receptors associated with a wide variety of stimuli and that they show considerable phenotypic plasticity associated with peripheral injury (Fukuoka and Noguchi, 2002; West et al., 2015). Most of the attention has focussed on the changes associated with small DRG cells that primarily innervate skin, since these are presumed to be responsible for evoked pain sensations after injury. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of injury on proprioceptors in general, and muscle afferents in particular. This is, in part, due to the paucity of histological markers associated with such fibres. The most commonly used marker of proprioceptive (muscle) afferents is parvalbumin (PV) (Medici and Shortland, 2015). PV is a calcium binding protein that is found in subsets of sensory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons. Studies that have explored the effects of nerve injury on muscle afferents reported no changes in its staining patterns after injury. However, those early studies used nerve injury models where injured and non-injured cell bodies coexist within the same DRG. Therefore, plasticity could occur without changing the absolute number of positive cells (downregulation in injured and upregulation in spared neurons). Now there are neuronal markers, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which can identify damaged afferents and nerve injury models where the injured and non-injured cell bodies are spatially segregated in adjacent spinal ganglia (Shortland et al., 2006). This prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not PV positive cells show phenotypic plasticity (Medici and Shortland, 2015). We first determined that around 25% of L4–5 DRG cells innervating the sciatic nerve express PV. Following axotomy of the sciatic nerve, this number did not significantly change over 1–28 days, confirming earlier studies. Co-expression with the neuronal injury marker ATF3 showed that approximately half the PV cells were axotomised suggesting that both injured and uninjured neurons express PV after sciatic nerve injury. However, around 50–60% of the L4 & L5 DRG neurons contribute axons to the sciatic nerve, so by itself this result did not really answer whether or not phenotypic plasticity was happening, since for switching to occur, one might predict that little or no colocalisation with ATF3 should occur. Therefore, we switched to the spinal nerve ligation model and selectively lesioned the L5 spinal nerve, whilst being careful not to injure the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. In this model, essentially all DRG neurons were injured and expressed ATF3 (Shortland et al., 2006). The percentage of PV staining in the axotomized L5 DRG was unchanged compared to the adjacent L4 DRG, the contralateral L5 DRG and naïve L5 DRG. On the other hand, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) staining, which is an accepted marker of peptidergic nociceptor afferents, including muscle afferents, was completely abolished in the ipsilateral L5 DRG. Thus, these results unequivocally showed that nerve injury did not produce a phenotypic change in PV positive afferents. They also highlighted a clear difference between phenotypic plasticity in proprioceptors versus nociceptors in response to nerve injury. There is now increasing knowledge of the molecular and biochemical repertoire of proprioceptors. Proprioceptors contain several calcium binding proteins such as calcineurin, calretinin and calbindin. They also contain metabolic markers such as carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome oxidase and the enzyme α3Na+/K+ ATPase. Several ion channels are associated with proprioceptors such as Piezo 2, acid sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3), transient receptor potential V2 (TRPV2), vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and other markers such as the PDZ scaffold protein whirlin. Piezo2, α3Na+/K+ ATPase and whirlin are specific markers for muscle spindles. Following nerve injury, muscle afferents become spontaneously active and can change their neurotransmitter content. They can upregulate galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but many of the markers do not change e.g., TRPV2, ASIC3, carbonic anhydrase, whilst the response to others such as Piezo 2 or whirlin are unknown. A key player in contributing to chronic pain appears to be the de novo expression of BDNF in muscle afferents (Michael et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2010). Recent evidence also implicates changes in the sodium channel Nav1.7 in proprioceptors as an important contributor to chronic pain (Fukuoka et al., 2015), as this is increased in muscle afferents after nerve injury. Yet the afferents retain their normal levels of PV. PV is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in a neuron. After nerve injury, muscle afferents have a reduced and redistributed presynaptic input onto homonymous motoneurons. Before injury, synapses were on the proximal dendrites, whilst after injury they were fewer in number and located further away from the soma. This explained the observations of weak excitatory post synaptic potentials to motoneurons and disappearance of stretch reflexes (Vincent et al., 2015). PV is found in the cell body and peripheral endings, but not in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord (Petitjean et al., 2015), suggesting PV is more important in physiological process such as speed of muscle contraction rather than neurotransmitter release. Nerve injury causes a selective loss of small, but not large-sized, DRG neurons and so PV may have a role in cell survival. Support for this idea comes from studies in motoneuron disease models, where PV is expressed in motoneuron groups that are resistant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and over-expression studies where PV prevents excitotoxic cell death (Medici and Shortland, 2015). Although PV is not present in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord, PV staining is clearly present in the dorsal horn. This is associated with the cell bodies and dendrites of a subset of inhibitory interneurons located in lamina IIi-III. Recent pharmacogenetic and selective ablation studies have shown that these PV neurons play a key gate keeping role in mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury (Petitjean et al., 2015). These neurons receive input from low threshold cutaneous afferents and in turn provide presynaptic inhibition of A-fibres as well as postsynaptic inhibition to PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Nerve injury induces a 50% loss of synaptic appositions between PV interneurons and PKCγ interneurons resulting in disinhibition of pain circuits, without causing any death of PV neurons. Moreover, selective pharmacological blockade of PKCγ neurons attenuated the injury-induced mechanical allodynia (Petitjean et al., 2015). Two other circuits have also been proposed for regulating nociceptive transmission: one involves the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM)-positive excitatory interneurons by dynorphin (Dyn)-positive inhibitory interneurons. The second involves vesicular glutamate transport 3 (vGlut3)-positive excitatory interneurons which regulate activity in PKCγ or calretinin-positive excitatory interneurons (Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Under normal conditions, the vGlut3 interneurons are under powerful inhibitory control but after nerve injury they can drive mechanical allodynia (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015; Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Future experiments should determine whether PV interneurons also gate connections with these two neuronal subpopulations. A final layer of complexity is added by the presence of another DRG subpopulation that can cause allodynia after nerve injury. C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) are attributed to conveying sensations of pleasant touch in normal circumstances but produce allodynia after injury (Nagi et al., 2011; Samour et al., 2015). These fibres have a unique molecular repertoire and terminate in lamina IIi of the cord onto central, stalked and vertical cells (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015). Since PV cells have these morphologies (Hughes et al., 2012) they are ideally placed to receive input from such afferents, although this speculation requires confirmation. Taken together, the results of our and other studies suggest that PV is an important protein related to sensory pathways and the plasticity that occurs after injury (Figure 1). We demonstrated that in primary afferents, PV did not change and so can still be used as an anatomical marker of proprioceptors to explore changes in other transmitters, ion channels or transcription factors after peripheral nerve injury. In the CNS, PV may confer preferential survival to excitotoxic insults and importantly gates abnormal sensory information after injury.Figure 1: Overview of the different roles of PV neurons in pain circuits of the spinal cord.PV identifies sensory proprioceptive afferents that make monosynaptic connections with lower motoneurons (MN). After injury, PV levels in DRG neurons remains unchanged but there is a loss of presynaptic terminals from MNs resulting in reduced motor function. In the spinal cord, PV identifies a subset of inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons that gate information from Aβ afferents by presynaptically inhibiting A-fibres and postsynaptically inhibiting PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Additionally, Aβ afferents contact other inhibitory (e.g., Dyn and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)) and excitatory (e.g., SOM) interneurons forming a circuit that regulates nociceptive transmission. Nerve injury alters the synaptic efficacy and results in decreased activation of inhibitory PV cells and increased activation of excitatory neurons (e.g., vGlut3, PKCγ and SOM) and so results in changes in the neuronal circuitry such that innocuous stimuli can now produce behavioural hypersensitivities such as mechanical and cold allodynia.

Surgery in adults provides seizure freedom in only one third of patients. The poor results of epilepsy surgery could be explained by an extrahypothalamic epileptogenic zone. The existence of an independent, secondary epileptogenic area with persistent seizures after resection of the presumably primary lesion supports the concept of a \"hypothalamic plus\" epilepsy. \"Hypothalamic plus\" epilepsy could be related to either an extrahypothalamic structural lesion (visible on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or on neuropathology) or if the former is absent, to a functional alteration with enhanced epileptogenic properties due to a process termed secondary epileptogenesis. We report two patients with gelastic seizures with HH (gelastic seizures isolated or associated with dyscognitive seizures of temporal origin). Both patients underwent two-step surgery: first an endoscopic resection of the HH, followed at a later time by temporal lobectomy. Both patients became seizure-free only after the temporal lobectomy. In both cases, neuropathology failed to demonstrate a significant structural lesion in the temporal lobe. To our knowledge, for the first time, these two cases suggest the existence of independent secondary epileptogenesis in humans.",

It was already known at the time of Hippocrates, and it was well described by Johanne Baptista Margagni, teacher at the Padua Medical School, in the 18th century. Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in the pres­ ence of hepatic functional impairment secondary to acute liver failure or chronic parenchymal liver disease with or without spontaneous or surgi­ cally induced portalsystemic shunting of portal blood. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of liver failure are varied and range from subtle alterations, including mild personality change and disturbance in sleep rhythm, to confusion, drowsiness, stupor, and finally deep coma. In acute liver failure the progression of events may be extremely rapid, taking place in only a few hours. In chronic encephalopathy, in contrast, consciousness may be slowly altered over months, and may occasionally present as progressive and irre­ versible neurological symptomatology with dementia, parkinsonism, or other extrapyramidal signs suggesting involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia (170). Most often in the chronic situation, however, episodes of mental impairment are episodic, the result of defined stresses, and recov­ ery to the premorbid state is the rule. Other symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are not specific for liver disease. Asterixis (flapping tremor of the extremities) is probably the most characteristic neurological sign of hepatic encephalopathy, is more common",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Concussion: Initial Evaluation and Management.",
      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, is common in adults and youth and is a major health concern. Concussion is caused by direct or indirect external trauma to the head resulting in shear stress to brain tissue from rotational or angular forces. Concussion can affect a variety of clinical domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional or behavioral. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptom onset must be determined. Headache is the most common symptom. Initial evaluation involves eliminating concern for cervical spine injury and more serious traumatic brain injury before diagnosis is established. Tools to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery include symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. If concussion is suspected in an athlete, the athlete should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest are key components of initial management. Initial management also involves patient education and reassurance and symptom management. Individuals recover from concussion differently; therefore, rigid guidelines have been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. As symptoms resolve, patients may gradually return to activity as tolerated. Those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately after injury, may require longer recovery periods. There is limited research in the younger population; however, given concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain, a more conservative approach to management is warranted.",

Ils peuvent entrainer des modifications visibles du comportement, une deterioration tres nette de la qualite de vie et dans des cas extremes des troubles nerveux post-traumatiques ou un etat depressif clinique (Berrios & Rose, 1992; Berrios et al, 1988) pouvant mener a des pensees suicidaires (Dobie, 2003). Les acouphenes peuvent provenir de differents relais des voies auditives peripheriques ou centrales, cependant la grande majorite des acouphenes chroniques est liee a une perte auditive, presbyacousie, ou exposition au bruit. En effet, approximativement 90% des acouphenes chroniques sont lies a une perte auditive (Nicolas-Puel et al. 2006).Les acouphenes peuvent entrainer des changements importants dans le fonctionnement de certains reseaux cerebraux. Meme en cas de lesion peripherique, l’anomalie perceptive qui en resulte peut a terme entrainer une modification de l’activite des structures cerebrales, par des phenomenes de plasticite. Malheureusement aujourd’hui compte tenu des divergences constatees aux niveaux des resultats obtenus par les differentes etudes effectuees chez les sujets acoupheniques, aucun consensus n’a pu etre etabli quant a l’etablissement d’un modele de la physiopathologie des acouphenes lies a une perte auditive.L’objectif general de ce travail est donc de mettre en place un protocole multimodal robuste afin de detecter des d’anomalies d’activation cerebrales chez des sujets souffrants d’acouphenes unilateraux lies a une perte auditive par rapport a des sujets normo-entendants.

En effet, les resultats de notre etude montrent selon plusieurs modalites que ce reseau est hypo-active chez les sujets presentant des acouphenes lies a une perte auditive. L’hypoactivite de ces regions pourrait etre reduite de facon temporaire par le masquage des acouphenes par une stimulation sonore.

Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction.

      "abstract": "There are three major types of headaches: tension, migraine, and organic.Tension headaches are the most common and are characterized by a dull ache or squeezing sensation around the head. Stress, hunger, fatigue, and eye strain are common causes of tension headaches. Eye strain may be the result of an uncorrected refractive error, problems with accommodation, or a convergence insufficiency.Migraine is a vascular headache often characterized by a throbbing or pulsating sensation. This type of headache is almost always accompanied with nausea and/or vomiting. Children describe many visual symptoms with migraine headaches and attacks are often caused by an external trigger.Organic headaches may be caused by fever, infection, inflammation, head trauma, or brain tumors—all of which require medical attention. Ophthalmologists should look for signs of papilledema, anisocoria, unexplained loss of vision, or diplopia. Headaches caused by brain tumors are typically progressive, severe in intensity, and resistant to analgesics. Children with brain tumors typically have other neurological symptoms such as dizziness, loss of coordination, numbness, tingling, or confusion.The proper diagnosis of headaches in children often hinges on the parents' ability to keep a detailed headache diary. If the headaches are frequent or severe enough that they are interfering with the child's social or emotional development, a complete physical and neurological evaluation is in order.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injuries are not uncommon in sports. Typically, these are associated with orthopaedic injury (eg, axillary nerve injury with glenohumeral joint dislocation) rather than the transection or gunshot-type injuries often seen in emergency departments.\n\nThe classification of nerve injuries is complex,1 2 but the underlying principle is that the simplest of nerve injuries is a physiological loss only (neurapraxia) and the most severe form is complete anatomical transection of the nerve and its coverings (neurotmesis). Between these two extremes are varying degrees of injury to the axon and its covering sheath.\n\nWith all degrees of nerve injury, the greater the degree of preservation of anatomical structures, the greater the chance of neurological recovery. Thus a neurapraxic injury will recover spontaneously, whereas a neurotmetic injury will not recover without surgical intervention. Between these two ends of the spectrum is a large group of nerve injuries in which the capacity for spontaneous recovery cannot be accurately assessed clinically and may require surgical exploration with or without nerve repair.\n\nOn the sports field, the most common mechanism of nerve injury is a stretch or traction type of injury. In the first few weeks following a stretch injury, clinical observation is required. and after sufficient time has elapsed for Wallerian degeneration to occur (at least 2 weeks), then nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) can be performed. Over the following 6–8 weeks, a nerve injury is then followed by clinical examination and repeat NCS/EMG, with the objective being to determine whether spontaneous recovery will occur. If there is failure of neurological recovery at 3 months after the injury, then surgical intervention is required to facilitate recovery before irreversible fibrosis in the denervated muscle results.\n\nThe principles used by the peripheral nerve surgeon include neurolysis, intraoperative nerve action potentials (NAP), primary repair, …",

      "title": "Music in healthy and diseased brain",
      "abstract": "Art and creativity originate in the brain and depend on normal brain functioning. Music is a multifacet phenomenon that exists as a universal heritage across all human societies and throughout the entire human history. There are numerous brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processing of music, including music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, as well as musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Music relates to many brain functions including perception, motor action, cognition, emotion, learning and memory. Various brain regions are associated with music processing and production, including the right anterior and posterior superior temporal lobe, the right inferior frontal cortex, the right prefrontal, bilateral premotor and bilateral parietal areas, the right anterior cerebellar lobe, language areas and limbic structures. In a diseased brain, after acquired brain injury, disorders in music perception or production have been described, although considered rare. Amusia or music-specific agnosia, a defective perception of music or its components is typically associated with temporal lobe lesions, and is more likely to occur with right-sided involvement. Etiology of acquired amusia comprise many diseases and conditions leading to brain injury, including traumatic brain injury, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, neoplasma, iatrogenic and epilepsy-related conditions, infections and degenerative diseases. Additionally, there are cases of congenital amusia, attributed to abnormality in neural networks for music, associated with structural variations in the frontal and temporal lobes.",

      "abstract": "The control of posture, stance and motion is highly demanding of the peripheral and central nervous system of a creature, especially if this creature is a relatively fast-moving bipedal one with a high center of gravity. With a sustained cerebral hypoxia/anoxia, a tonic phase with or without myoclonia, that is convulsive syncope, appears. Drop attacks of the vertebro-basal circulation are caused by a transient ischemia of the cortical spinal pathways or the paramedian reticular formation. Cataplexia is defined by a paresis of the skeletal muscles due to a sudden emotion. The triggering emotions are usually of a positive nature. Cataplectic attacks are most commonly triggered by sudden laughter. In startle diseases, the physiological startle reaction is pathologically increased and leads, among others things, to a paroxysmal loss of control of the body posture. In typical absence seizures, the semiology and EEG findings strongly indicate the diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy.",

In the sensorimotor examination, typical motor changes include distal muscle wasting and weakness, with diminution or loss of distal reflexes and loss of distal vibratory sensibility and sometimes other modalities such as pain and proprioception. However, not all older individuals show such changes, perhaps reflecting 'successful' or 'optimal', as opposed to 'normal', ageing.",

Low-voltage injuries, after other pathologic and high-voltage sources are ruled out, tend to be rather benign acutely although they may have significant long-term morbidity, including chronic pain syndromes. Lightning injuries affect 800 to 1000 persons per year. In lightning injury, cardiac arrest is the main cause of death, burns tend to be superficial, ad injuries often are what one would expect of short-circuiting or overloading the body's electrical systems (tinnitus, blindness, confusion, amnesia, cardiac arrhythmias, and vascular instability). Although high-voltage injuries may require the services of trauma surgeons, in general, therapy for low-voltage and lightning injury is supportive and involves cardiac resuscitation for the more seriously injured and supportive care for the less severely injured. Long-term problems from sleep disturbances, anxiety attacks, pain syndromes, peripheral nerve damage, fear of storms (for lightning patients), and diffuse neurologic and neuropsychologic damage may occur in both electrical and lightning patients. Other sequelae--such as seizures or severe brain damage from hypoxia during cardiac arrest and spinal artery syndrome from vascular spasm--are indirect results of electrical and lightning injury.",

Many alternative causes of encephalitis can be excluded after a careful clinical history and evaluation of the CSF, brain MRI, and routine blood tests. Some types of encephalitis can be suspected before receiving the results of neural antibodies, according to the clinical presentation (for instance, faciobrachial dystonic seizures in anti-LGI encephalitis, or psychotic manifestation in anti-NMDAR encephalitis) or brain MRI features (temporal lobe involvement in limbic encephalitis). Antibody testing may show false positive and negative results, particularly when only serum is examined, results are not confirmed with additional laboratory studies, or the test is used indiscriminately without selection of patients.",

In extremely stressful situation the cognitive functions of the depressive individuals may impaired to such an extent that they may have the feeling of entrapment for which they may take the way of suicidal acts for escape. A number of brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions are altered in depression patients, suicidal individuals and in complete suicides. Along with the morphological changes, monoaminergic neurotransmission system is also severely deteriorated in these brain regions indicating their possible involvements in regulating cognitive activities. Monoaminergic dysfunctions may give rise to serious cognitive impairments and deterioration of associated mental functions required for maintaining normal internal homeostasis. Loss of cognitive functions makes an individual incapable to interact properly to various aspects of normal life functions making them depressive and severe depression may be the forerunner of suicidal acts.",

      "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading genetic cause of infantile death. SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, leading to weakness and muscle atrophy. SMA occurs as a result of homozygous deletion or mutations in Survival Motor Neuron-1 (SMN1). Loss of SMN1 leads to a dramatic reduction in SMN protein, which is essential for motor neuron survival. SMA disease severity ranges from extremely severe to a relatively mild adult onset form of proximal muscle atrophy. Severe SMA patients typically die mostly within months or a few years as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and bulbar paralysis. SMA is widely known as a motor neuron disease; however, there are numerous clinical reports indicating the involvement of additional peripheral organs contributing to the complete picture of the disease in severe cases. In this review, we have compiled clinical and experimental reports that demonstrate the association between the loss of SMN and peripheral organ deficiency and malfunction. Whether defective peripheral organs are a consequence of neuronal damage/muscle atrophy or a direct result of SMN loss will be discussed.",

      "title": "Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the leading cause of death in comatose patients after cardiac arrest resuscitation. Poor neurological outcome is defined as death from neurological cause, persistent vegetative state, or severe neurological disability which is predicted in these patients by assessing the severity of HIE. Background: The most commonly used indicators of severe HIE include a bilateral absence of corneal and pupillary reflexes, bilateral absence of N2O waves of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials, high blood concentrations of neuron-specific enolase, unfavorable patterns on electroencephalogram, and signs of diffuse HIE on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Current guidelines recommend performing prognostication no earlier than 72 hours after return of spontaneous circulation in all comatose patients with an absent or extensor motor response to pain, after having excluded confounders such as residual sedation that may interfere with clinical examination. A multimodal approach combining multiple prognostication tests are recommended so that the risk of a false prediction can be minimized. Materials: Neuroprognostication is vital and yet continues to be one of the most controversial topics in post-resuscitation care. Specifically, concerning HIE, the 2006 practice parameters of the American Academy of Neurology provide specific recommendations for the prognostication of neurologic outcomes for cardiac arrest survivors not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). To date, there is no adequate paradigm for prognostication in HIE treated with TH. Clinical examination including the presence or absence of brainstem reflexes, motor responses and absence of myoclonus were traditionally used to predict a favorable prognosis. Electrophysiologic testing in the form of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), the serum biomarker neuron-specific enolase (NSE), as well as neuroimaging, have been employed as additional tests to attempt to improve the predictive accuracy of neuroprognostication. However, what limited certainty these tests and parameters provided has become even more questionable in the setting of therapeutic hypothermia. The use of sedatives and analgesics adds a degree of uncertainty given unpredictable drug effects on patients’ neurologic status. EEG, SSEP are the most common electrophysiological modalities utilized in neuroprognostication. EEG has been evaluated in the prognostication of cardiac arrest survivors and has also led to some essential clinical discoveries. The 2006 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameters assign EEG a false-positive rate (FPR) of 3% with a CI of 0.9; making it the least predictive method to determine neurologic outcomes. Abend et al., pooled four existing studies on EEG in cardiac arrest (CA) patients who had undergone therapeutic hypothermia and found that 29% of these patients had acute electrographic non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Conclusion: There is no good evidence from well-designed studies to support substantial accuracy of early prognostication ( &lt; 72 hours post-arrest) in cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Given our lack of understanding of how therapeutic hypothermia improves outcomes, as well as its effects on emergence from the coma and its well-described effects in altering drug metabolism and clearance, it is prudent to be more conservative in approaching prognostication. Patients should be observed for a minimum of 72 hours post-arrest. However, 5-7 or more days of observation may be necessary to fully account for the effects of therapeutic hypothermia.",

      "title": "Anaesthesia and the brain",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTABSTRACTThe brain is often a window to early changes in blood flow, tissue perfusion, or early neural damage manifested by a decline in higher cortical functions including recall memory and cognitive processing. The elderly population is particularly at risk of central nervous system injury, which may manifest as stroke and/or cognitive deterioration due to reduced cognitive reserve, as seen with aging-related cognitive decline. These changes in cognitive function are associated with reduced activities in daily living that substantially reduce the quality of life of the elderly, and can be magnified by physical or emotional stress in high-risk individuals.The safety of anaesthesia and surgery has progressed over several decades to the point that today elderly and debilitated patients may safely undergo increasingly complex procedures with low risk of major morbidity or mortality. However, anaesthesia and surgery appear to be associated with risk of brain injury, including stroke, and changes in cognitive functioning that outlast the effects of anaesthesia or pain medications, inflammation and the healing response. Several excellent studies have investigated the aetiology of the changes associated with cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. Understanding this decline and its aetiology is complicated by the fact that anaesthesia and surgery are rarely separated, indicating that the differences may be due to the stress response associated with surgery or the administration of anaesthetics. The focus of this lecture is on the complex field of neuroscience, and particularly cognitive neurosciences, in the elderly population, and the complex process of measuring and defining change in the perioperative period. Different types of surgery, implications for quality of life, as well as aetiological factors and how they relate to treatment, will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Although, classically, stroke symptoms are maximal at onset and patients gradually recover over days, weeks, and months, patients sometimes deteriorate. People have termed the phenomenon stroke progression, stroke in evolution, stroke deterioration, and symptom fluctuation. There is no consistent terminology. The phenomenon occurs from different causes and is incompletely understood. Although the typical definition of a significant neurological deterioration in trials has been a gain of ≥ 1 point on item 1a (level of consciousness) or ≥ 4 points in the motor items of the NIHSS, any detectable deterioration should prompt careful assessment and a tailored work-up.",

      "title": "Acute peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Summary Peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders are the most common complication experienced by older individuals undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. Peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders, particularly postoperative delirium, result in long‐term poor outcomes including: death; dementia; loss of independence; and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Recent changes to the nomenclature of these disorders aims to align peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders with cognitive disorders in the community, with consistent definitions and clinical diagnosis. Possible mechanisms include: undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease; inflammation and resulting neuroinflammation; neuronal damage; and comorbid systemic disease. Pre‐operative frailty represents a significant risk for poor postoperative outcomes; it is associated with an increase in the incidence of cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition to cognitive decline, frailty is associated with poor functional outcomes following elective non‐cardiac surgery. It was recently shown that 29% of frail patients died or experienced institutionalisation or new disability within 90 days of major elective surgery. Identification of vulnerable patients before undergoing surgery and anaesthesia is the key to preventing peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders. Current approaches include: pre‐operative delirium and cognitive screening; blood biomarker analysis; intra‐operative management that may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium such as lighter anaesthesia using processed electroencephalography devices; and introduction of guidelines which may reduce or prevent delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This review will address these issues and advocate for an approach to care for older peri‐operative patients which starts in the community and continues throughout the pre‐operative, intra‐operative, postoperative and post‐discharge phases of care management, involving multidisciplinary medical teams, as well as family and caregivers wherever possible.",

      "title": "Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia Type 1",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is characterized by childhood onset of slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, followed by oculomotor apraxia and a severe primary motor peripheral axonal motor neuropathy. The first manifestation is progressive gait imbalance (mean age of onset: 4.3 years; range: 2-10 years), followed by dysarthria, then upper-limb dysmetria with mild intention tremor. Oculomotor apraxia, usually noticed a few years after the onset of ataxia, progresses to external ophthalmoplegia. All affected individuals have generalized areflexia followed by a peripheral neuropathy and quadriplegia with loss of ambulation about seven to ten years after onset. Hands and feet are short and atrophic. Chorea and upper-limb dystonia are common. Intellect remains normal in some individuals; in others, different degrees of cognitive impairment have been observed. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AOA1 is based on clinical findings (including family history) and exclusion of the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia. Cerebellar atrophy is visible on MRI in all affected individuals. EMG reveals axonal neuropathy in 100% of individuals with AOA1. APTX is the only gene known to be associated with AOA1. Management Treatment of manifestations: May include physical therapy, particularly for disabilities resulting from peripheral neuropathy; a wheelchair for mobility, usually by age 15-20 years; educational support for difficulties with speaking, reading, and writing. Prevention of secondary complications: High-protein diet to prevent edema by restoring serum albumin concentration; low-cholesterol diet. Surveillance: Routine follow up with a neurologist. Genetic counseling AOA1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being neither affected nor a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants in a family have been identified.",

We reported 3 cases of a delayed-onset, pancerebellar syndrome that developed 6 weeks to 2 years after head trauma. All the patients had a severe insult, followed by a prolonged period of coma (2 days to 2 months).

      "title": "Pharmacological Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

This is a rare case of a penetrating missile wound of the head, most likely caused by the use of a stone propelled by a slingshot that penetrated the skull and lacerated the brain with the stone embedded within the substance of the brain.

Cognitive ability (eg, verbal fluency, maintaining attention, achieving goals) may also be diminished. Neurologic signs may include abnormal reflexes, increased or decreased motor behavior, and loss of ability to complete purposeful movement. If the damage is caused by trauma, treatment begins with care of the acute injury. Any resulting seizures should be treated with an anticonvulsant and the patient observed carefully for side effects. Another agent (eg, a stimulant, antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressant) may be needed as well, depending on the individual patient, to restore as much psychological function as possible. Counseling of both the patient and the family is important to help them avoid some difficulties and frustrations that may accompany the change in personality.",

      "title": "The Neurotoxicity of Drugs Given Intrathecally (Spinal)",
      "abstract": "A growing understanding of the neuropharmacology of spinal cord processing of nociceptive input has led to intense interest in the use of spinal drugs in anesthesia and pain management. The direct application of receptor-specific therapeutics at the spinal cord can potentially interrupt specific pain pathways and limit systemic side effects, but this practice also carries the inherent risk of injury to the central nervous system. Thus, the neurotoxicity of spinal drugs is a central safety issue. Spinal cord or nerve root toxicity may manifest itself as histologic, physiologic, or behavioral/clinical derangements after exposure to a spinal drug. Neurohistopathology is broadly classified as neural injury, gliosis, or damage to the myelin sheath, and it also describes inflammatory changes and involvement of the arachnoid cell layers. Physiologic neurotoxicity of spinal drugs includes changes in spinal cord blood flow, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in the electrophysiology of impulse conduction. Behavioral and clinical signs of neurotoxicity include pain, motor and sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Ideally, a complete roster of histological, physiologic, and behavioral testing would be performed on spinal drugs in several animal species, followed by safety trials in humans before widespread use. In practice, drugs have taken a variety of roads from conception to application, and often without safety data. In this article, we review available neurotoxicity data on drugs that have a clinical application, classified as spinal local anesthetics, spinal analgesics, or spinal adjuvants. Spinal Local Anesthetics The 100-yr history of spinal local anesthetic use in humans has typically involved self-experimentation, followed by widespread application with little or no controlled testing for neurotoxicity. Bier and Hildebrant [1] initially performed spinal anesthesia with cocaine on themselves in 1898, and essentially all of the earliest local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia were introduced in this fashion without toxicity studies. Despite a long history of clinical use, recent interest in neurotoxicity has arisen due to concerns over reports of cauda equina syndrome and transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) from spinal local anesthetics. We review animal data that have been used to assess the neurotoxicity of local anesthetics and summarize data available from human studies. In 1985, Ready et al. [2] evaluated the neurotoxic effects of single injections of local anesthetics in rabbits. They reported that spinal cord histopathology remained normal and that persistent neurologic deficits were not seen with clinically used concentrations of tetracaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chlorprocaine. However, histopathologic changes and neurologic deficits did occur with higher concentrations of tetracaine (1%) and lidocaine (8%). In this model, extensive neurologic impairment was not necessarily accompanied by equally extensive lesions in the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus demonstrating the need for multiple models to fully assess neurotoxicity. Recent studies have used desheathed peripheral nerve models, designed to mimic unprotected nerve roots in the cauda equina, to further assess electrophysiologic neurotoxicity of clinically relevant concentrations of local anesthetics [3-5]. These models demonstrate that clinically used concentrations of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% tetracaine cause irreversible conduction block, whereas 1.5% lidocaine, 0.75% bupivacaine, and 0.06% tetracaine do not. Electrophysiologic toxicity of lidocaine in these models is concentration-dependent (Figure 1) beginning at 40 mM (approximately 1%) with irreversible ablation of the compound action potential at 80 mM (approximately 2%). Kanai et al. [4] subsequently demonstrated that generation of action potentials was more vulnerable than maintenance of resting membrane potential and that irreversible ablation of action and resting membrane potential by lidocaine seems to be both concentration- and time-dependent.Figure 1: The nonreversible effect of 40 mM lidocaine on the compound action potential (CAP) of frog sciatic nerve. Lidocaine was applied to a stable nerve preparation for 15 min, then washed with frog Ringer's solution for 2 h. Tracings represent CAPs in response to stimuli (1-Hz stimulus = heavy line, 40-Hz stimulus = thin line). Lidocaine 40 mM completely ablated the CAP when applied to the nerve. The 1-Hz CAP response began to return after 10-15 min of washing and reached a new level in 45 min, where it was stable for the subsequent 2 h of observation. The recovered 1-Hz CAP is only 65% of the original. Reprinted with the publisher's permission from Holman SJ. Anesthesiology: hyperbaric dye solution distribution. Anesthesiology 1997;86:969.Effects of local anesthetics on spinal cord blood flow seem benign. Spinal administration of bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine causes vasodilation and increase spinal cord blood flow [6,7], whereas ropivacaine causes concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and reduction in spinal cord blood flow [6]. However, the effects of lidocaine on blood flow of in vitro peripheral nerve models are more concerning. Myers et al. [8] applied solutions of isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1% and 2% lidocaine with and without epinephrine, and epinephrine alone to isolated rat sciatic nerve and measured changes in blood flow with a laser Doppler flow probe. Blood flow was significantly depressed for all solutions except isotonic sodium chloride solution. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow, and, when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by local anesthetics alone. Although experimental studies in animals have provided ample evidence that some local anesthetics in clinically relevant concentrations can injure nerve tissue, the exact mechanisms of injury are unclear. Recent work on neuronal cell lines has attempted to determine the mechanism of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Johnson and Uhl [9] have shown that direct application of 2.5%-5.0% lidocaine caused a >3-fold increase in intracellular calcium and up to a 20% incidence of cell death during 60 min of exposure in the neuronal cell line. They postulated that the mechanism of neurotoxicity was not likely from sodium channel blockade, because such a block would not lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Subsequent work in this model determined that 0.5% and 1.0% lidocaine, as well as 0.625% bupivacaine, lead to transient, moderate increases in calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum, without cell death [10]. Thus, several different laboratory models have proven that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic but that lidocaine and tetracaine are potentially more neurotoxic than bupivacaine (Table 1).Table 1: Local Anesthetic ToxicityDespite the knowledge that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic in the laboratory model, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics in humans (Table 2). Retrospective [11], prospective [12], and historical studies [13-15] report 0%-0.7% incidence of postoperative neurologic injury in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Although lacking a denominator, information from closed-claims databases corroborate these findings [16,17]. Thus, the neurotoxic potential of spinally administered local anesthetics has not manifested itself in large-scale studies.Table 2: Large Epidemiologic Studies of the Neurologic Complications of Spinal AnesthesiaThere are few nonepidemiologic clinical studies evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics, and all have focused on electrophysiologic variables after spinal anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials, monosynaptic H-reflex [18], and cutaneous current perception thresholds [19] have been used to evaluate recovery after spinal anesthesia. These measurements have shown complete return to baseline activity after 5% lidocaine spinal anesthesia in very small study populations. Histopathologic or other physiologic data in humans are lacking; thus, information from controlled studies in humans is essentially not available. Lidocaine Controversy about the use of single-injection spinal lidocaine began in 1993 when Schneider et al. [20] published four cases of short-lived neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. This was the first report to question the potential for neurotoxicity with standard clinical doses and concentrations of lidocaine after single-injection spinal anesthesia. Subsequent prospective, randomized studies reveal a 4%-33% incidence of TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia (Table 3) [21,22]. This incidence varies with the type of surgical procedure and is unaffected by baricity or the dilution of lidocaine to 0.5%. Contemporary reports of cauda equina syndrome after continuous lidocaine spinal anesthesia and the potential concentration-dependent neurotoxicity of lidocaine have led several authors to label TNS as a manifestation of subclinical neurotoxicity.Table 3: Incidence of Transient Neurologic Symptoms (TNS) with Spinal Anesthesia in Prospective Randomized StudiesAs previously discussed, laboratory work in both intrathecal and desheathed peripheral nerve models has proven that the concentration of lidocaine is a critical factor in neurotoxicity. Because concentrations of lidocaine <40 mM (approximately 1.0%) are not neurotoxic to desheathed peripheral nerve, such dilute concentrations of spinal lidocaine should not cause TNS if the syndrome is caused by subclinical concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. We recently examined whether spinal lidocaine concentrations of <1.0% might therefore decrease the incidence of TNS [21]. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy were randomized to receive 50 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine as either a 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% solution. There was no difference in the incidence of TNS (18%) among the three groups. The high incidence of TNS with lidocaine concentrations <1%, despite further dilution in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to lessen the plausibility of a concentration-dependent neurotoxic etiology. Other potential etiologies for TNS include patient positioning, early mobilization, needle trauma, neural ischemia, pooling of local anesthetics secondary to maldistribution by pencil-point needles or the addition of glucose, muscle spasm, myofascial trigger points, and irritation of dorsal ganglia [21]. The etiology of TNS is undetermined, and further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In summary, local anesthetics all have the potential to be neurotoxic, particularly in concentrations and doses larger than those used clinically. In histopathologic, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and neuronal cell models, lidocaine and tetracaine seem to have a greater potential for neurotoxicity than bupivacaine at clinically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics. Spinal Analgesics There is a complex system of different receptors for the transmission and inhibition of nociception in the spinal cord. These receptors include [micro sign]1-opioid receptors, alpha2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, gamma-amino butyric acid agonist (GABA) receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides substance P and somatostatin function as activators and inhibitors of nociception, respectively, and arachidonic acid metabolites enhance pain transmission [23]. Drugs that have been administered spinally in humans are thought to act directly or indirectly within this array of agonists and receptor sites (Figure 2). For each drug, the animal safety data and the human safety data are presented and summarized in Table 4.Figure 2: Schematic of mechanisms and sites of actions of spinal analgesics. mu-1 = opioid receptor, m1 = muscarinic type I acetylcholine receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, alpha2 = adrenergic receptor, NE = norepinephrine, GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAr = GABA receptor, NMDAr = N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NK-1r = neurokinin 1 receptor, NSAIDS = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, + and unshaded arrows = activation, - and black arrows = inhibition.Table 4: Evidence of Neurotoxicity of Spinal AnalgesicsOpioids Hydrophilic Opioids. Dogs and cats exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal morphine for several weeks through indwelling catheters showed no abnormal histopathology of the spinal cord under light microscopy [24,25]. Spinal cord blood flow is unaffected by 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine in dogs [26]. Consistent with a lack of histologic or physiologic neurotoxicity, behavioral effects reported in rats receiving 10-100 [micro sign]g/kg intrathecal morphine did not include evidence of neurotoxicity [27]. Limited postmortem neurohistopathology studies in patients with cancer after long-term, continuous intrathecal infusions containing morphine failed to definitively implicate the drug (with metabisulfite preservative) in any histopathologic abnormalities [28,29]. Electrophysiologic study of spinal morphine is limited to examination of somatosensory evoked potentials, which are unchanged despite intense analgesia [30]. No clinical abnormalities attributable to intrathecal morphine were reported in these studies. Spinal meperidine has undergone no published preclinical animal neurotoxicity testing. In humans, spinal meperidine has been reported as an effective sole drug for surgical anesthesia without noted clinical neuropathology, but no formal neurotoxicity testing has been undertaken [31]. Spinal hydromorphone has not been safety tested in animals. A single report describes hydromorphone administered spinally with clonidine in a woman with cancer pain without postmortem evidence of abnormal neurohistopathology [32]. Lipophilic Opioids. In its present preservative-free, commercially available form, fentanyl is commonly administered spinally. However, fentanyl is also notably absent from animal safety testing data. Histopathologic studies of isolated rabbit vagus nerve axons bathed in test solution failed to show evidence of localized neural damage with fentanyl dissolved in isotonic solution. Potential electrophysiologic neurotoxicity was reported with the commercially available hypotonic solution of fentanyl, which caused permanent conduction deficits comparable to water alone [33]. In vivo, only relatively large doses of fentanyl citrate would be expected to create a hypotonic intrathecal environment. Controlled human safety data are also minimal with spinal fentanyl. There are no published reports specifically addressing the histologic, physiologic, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal fentanyl. No report of persistent neurologic complications was retrieved from a MEDLINE search, despite widespread clinical use of spinal fentanyl. Sufentanil was administered to cats with indwelling intrathecal catheters for 5 days without distinguishable neurohistopathological abnormalities [27]. Similarly, dogs exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal sufentanil for several weeks also showed no abnormal histopathology [24]. However, sheep exposed to large (approximately 50 [micro sign]g) and very large (approximately 200 [micro sign]g) doses of sufentanil every 6 h for 3 days through intrathecal catheters showed evidence of dose-dependent spinal cord histopathology [34]. These findings may reflect a neurotoxic effect at large doses or quite possibly an artifact of the experimental design due to the frequent, large-volume, hypotonic preparation used in this study. No studies of spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology are available. The rats, cats, and dogs used in the above experiments had no persistent behavioral deficits. The sheep demonstrated dose-dependent agitation and hind-limb motor deficits that resolved spontaneously. There is no formal human neurotoxicity testing of sufentanil, but there are also no clinical reports of neurological impairment from widespread use. The spinal administration of alfentanil to cats for 5 days and to dogs for several weeks through indwelling intrathecal catheters induced no abnormal histopathology [24]. There are no reports of human experience with intrathecal alfentanil. Spinal remifentanil has been studied for efficacy in rats, but no histopathology has been published [35]. Rat behavior changes, other than sedation, were not reported, and recovery was not described. There is no published human experience with spinal remifentanil. Partial Opioid Receptor Agonists. In the sheep experiments with sufentanil noted above, butorphanol given intrathecally as a commercial solution of citrate and tartate salts caused florid histologic and behavioral pathology, whereas nalbuphine in saline was associated with minimal inflammatory histologic changes, mild neuronal changes at large doses, and transient hindlimb weakness [34]. No other animal or human data are available. In summary, laboratory studies and extensive clinical experience with morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil can reasonably assure the safety of limited intrathecal doses of these drugs. Other opioid agonists or partial agonists are without animal and human safety testing data. alpha2 Receptor Agonists Clonidine is the predominant spinal alpha2-agonist. Extensive preclinical tests in animals produced no neurohistopathologic abnormalities in rats, dogs, sheep, or monkeys. Spinal cord blood flow studies in rats, pigs, and awake sheep reveal perturbations that, on the whole, do not suggest significant decreases under normal clinical circumstances. No behavioral abnormalities suggesting neurotoxicity have been associated with intrathecal clonidine [36]. There has been extensive and graded exposure of humans to spinal clonidine (>968 surgical, obstetrical, and chronic pain patients) with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [36]. Although no histopathologic or physiologic studies have been reported, clonidine seems to be a safe spinal drug in humans. Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors Neostigmine indirectly produces a muscarinic agonist effect by inhibiting acetycholinesterase and has been shown to cause analgesia in animal and human experiments. Neurohistopathological analysis of rats and dogs after long-term intrathecal neostigmine (with and without paraben preservatives) administration reveal no spinal cord toxicity [37,38]. Neostigmine does not affect spinal cord blood flow in sheep [37], and there were no behavioral changes suggesting neurotoxicity reported in the above animal studies. Phase I safety assessments in human volunteers have been performed for both preservative-free (50-750 [micro sign]g) and paraben-containing hyperbaric preparations (10-100 [micro sign]g) of spinal neostigmine without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [40,41]. Although the human experience with spinal neostigmine is limited, clinical trials performed thus far have not reported any evidence of neurologic sequelae. gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Agonists (Table 5) Midazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam is soluble in an aqueous solution when buffered to approximately pH 3.5. At physiologic pH, midazolam becomes lipophilic, facilitating tissue penetration. These characteristics have made midazolam the most extensively studied spinal benzodiazepine. Neurotoxicity studies in animals have yielded conflicting results. Four initial rat studies with intrathecal catheter implantation using 0.15 mg/kg for 15 days (two studies) or isolated exposures to 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of midazolam (two studies) prepared in saline solution showed no neurotoxic reactions on light or electron microscopy [42]. However, a subsequent study in rabbits after a single 0.1 mg/kg intrathecal injection of midazolam reported that three of nine animals (33%) showed spinal cord histopathologic changes 8 days after exposure [43]. The diffuse nature of the histopathologic abnormalities that uncharacteristically extended from cervical to lumbar sections, the presence of significant and persistent diastolic hypotension in the treatment group, and the delayed postmortem tissue fixation all suggest a possible systemic source of artifact in the three affected animals. To investigate these contrasting results, a state-of-the-art study on the rat was performed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, cell morphometry, and transcardial tissue fixation after daily intrathecal administration of approximately 0.3 mg/kg midazolam for 20 days [44]. The spinal cords showed strong evidence of neuronal death and cellular abnormalities, even on light microscopy, in most midazolam-treated rats. Of note, a hypotonic commercial preparation of midazolam was used in contrast to the isotonic saline preparation used in all previous reports. Hypotonicity results in permanent nerve injury in isolated nerve preparations [33] and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of spinal sufentanil in sheep [45]. Although hypotonicity may be the etiology of the reported abnormalities, intrinsic neurotoxicity of spinal midazolam is a consideration.Table 5: Comparative Animal and Human Toxicity Data of Common Spinal AdjuvantsNo animal studies on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology have been reported. The effect of midazolam on blood-brain barrier integrity was investigated in the above-described study on rabbits and showed compromise in three of nine animals [43]. Despite some histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity, no significant behavioral abnormalities have been reported in any of the animal neurotoxicity studies of intrathecal midazolam. There are no histologic or physiologic studies of humans exposed to spinal midazolam, although there are seven small reports of intrathecal midazolam for anesthesia and pain management. Within this limited human experience, there are no reports of clinical neurologic deficit, even after prolonged continuous intrathecal use in four patients with chronic benign pain syndromes [46]. Midazolam neurotoxicity is controversial. Although the commercial midazolam solution seems to be neurotoxic in rats, hypotonicity of the solution may be culpable, rather than the drug itself. Midazolam in saline does not seems to be neurotoxic in the rat, but it may be toxic in the rabbit. There are insufficient studies in humans to determine the risk of neurotoxicity with spinal midazolam. Baclofen Spinal spasticity, which is thought to result from disinhibition of motor horn cells after upper motor neuron damage, can be treated with baclofen. Baclofen is a stable analog of GABA and interacts primarily with the inhibitory GABA-B receptors in lamina 2 of the dorsal horn (Figure 1). Twenty-eight dogs exposed to chronic spinal delivery of either saline, clinical, or supraclinical doses of baclofen showed no neurohistopathologic changes. Cats exposed to intrathecal baclofen for 8 days likewise showed no abnormal spinal cord histopathology [47]. No studies on spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology have been published with regards to intrathecal baclofen. Neither dogs, cats, nor monkeys showed behavioral evidence of neurotoxicity [25]. There are no published human studies evaluating histopathologic or physiologic neurotoxicity of baclofen. Spinal baclofen was infused in seven subjects for 3-22 mo without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [48]. An extensive review of cases involving intrathecal baclofen overdose did not note any long-term sequelae [49]. Based on animal studies and considerable clinical experience, spinal baclofen is not likely to cause neurologic damage. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonists Ketamine. Animal studies examining the neurotoxicity of ketamine generally support its safety, with the exception of some poorly explained findings. Studies performed in monkeys, baboons, and rabbits after single-dose intrathecal ketamine injections (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) with and without benzethonium chloride preservative did not uncover histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity [50,51]. In contrast, two other rat studies reported histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal ketamine. One study found vacuolization of the ganglion cells in posterior nerve roots in 3 of 33 rats that died immediately on injection of preservative-free ketamine [52]. However, it is difficult to ascribe these findings to ketamine neurotoxicity given the uncertain circumstances of demise. Similarly, another rat study with single intrathecal injections of 2.5 mg of ketamine hydrochloride with the preservative benzethonium chloride reported that two of six rats had radicular demyelination injury at sites distant from the injections on histological examination [53]. However, more than half of the animals in the ketamine treatment group either died after rapid injection (two rats) or had single hindlimb paralysis after injection (four rats), which puts the validity of the results in question. No animal studies have been published on the effect of spinal ketamine on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology. Rabbits showed a pattern of blood-brain barrier compromise differing significantly from that of saline-injected control rabbits after single 3-mg injections of ketamine with chlorbutanol [43] but not with preservative-free ketamine [50]. The neurotoxicity of spinal ketamine is largely untested in humans, despite a few case series reporting ketamine use for spinal anesthesia and analgesia [54]. Taken together, the rat, rabbit, and primate studies with intrathecal ketamine support its safety if used without a preservative. A small preliminary human experience suggests that the anesthetic is well tolerated. However, the commercially available preparation of ketamine contains an untested preservative (benzethonium chloride) and cannot be recommended for intrathecal use in humans. Amitriptyline. Preclinical animal testing of intrathecal amitriptyline is limited to a physiologic assessment in adult sheep [55]. A range of intrathecal doses (0.25, 1, or 5 mg) with a maximal dose representing approximately 25-50 times the anticipated human dose did not reduce spinal cord blood flow. No behavioral abnormalities were reported except for transient agitation with the injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline. The injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline into the cervical intrathecal space sedated the animals for 10-60 min, whereas 10 mg produced intense sedation and seizure, followed by death from uncertain causes in one animal. Long-term exposure and neurohistopathologic studies are reported to be in progress [55]. The determination of amitriptyline neurotoxicity awaits further investigation. Somatostatin In rats, intrathecal somatostatin (SST) produced marked, dose-dependent neurotoxic responses at or near doses required to produce analgesia [56] with similar findings in cats and mice [57]. SST administered in similar doses to guinea pigs, in contrast, did not provoke significant neurohistopathological changes [58]. Spinal SST in rats had significant vasoconstrictive effects in the spinal cord and brain, leading to reduced blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and compromised blood-brain barrier [59]. No spinal cord blood flow changes were seen in the guinea pig. Significant behavioral changes were noted in the rat, cat, and mouse experiments, but not in the guinea pig experiments. Species differences in the neurotoxic susceptibility to SST may explain these differences, but there is evidence for neurotoxicity in several animal species. In humans, spinal SST has been offered to terminally ill patients. Four patients with intractable cancer pain were studied after daily injections of spinal SST. Postmortem histopathology was undertaken on the spinal cords of two patients. One showed moderate degeneration of some dorsal roots within the cauda equina, whereas the other demonstrated no histopathologic changes. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were not discussed [60]. In summary, SST has been shown to be neurotoxic in rats, mice, and cats at doses comparable to those that confer analgesia. In humans, relatively small doses of SST have been anecdotally reported to variably relieve pain in the absence of overt neurologic sequelae. Based on this demonstrated record of neurotoxicity in several animal species, spinal SST should be considered a last-line analgesic only in the terminally ill patient. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Prostaglandins are involved in the spinal cord facilitation of pain processing, and spinal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can abolish wind-up behavior in animals [61]. Although the analgesic efficacy of spinal ketorolac has been established, no animal neurotoxicity studies have been published [61]. However, the 10% alcohol solvent used for commercial preparations is potentially neurotoxic, and commercial ketorolac should not be used spinally. Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) dosed intrathecally has been shown to be antinociceptive and has been tested in the rat for neurotoxicity with conflicting results. Although limited technically by a >50% spinal cord trauma rate related to needle puncture, one rat study reported radicular demyelination injury in one of the seven undamaged rats (14%) who received intrathecal L-ASA [53]. In contrast, neither histopathologic abnormalities nor a persistent decrease in spinal cord blood flow were seen in another rat study with large daily doses of L-ASA for at least 14 days [62]. The initial study described aggressive behavioral changes in rats after the spinal injection of L-ASA, leading to death from combat. The subsequent study did not report behavioral findings.

      "title": "The Neurotoxicity of Drugs Given Intrathecally (Spinal)",
      "abstract": "A growing understanding of the neuropharmacology of spinal cord processing of nociceptive input has led to intense interest in the use of spinal drugs in anesthesia and pain management. The direct application of receptor-specific therapeutics at the spinal cord can potentially interrupt specific pain pathways and limit systemic side effects, but this practice also carries the inherent risk of injury to the central nervous system. Thus, the neurotoxicity of spinal drugs is a central safety issue. Spinal cord or nerve root toxicity may manifest itself as histologic, physiologic, or behavioral/clinical derangements after exposure to a spinal drug. Neurohistopathology is broadly classified as neural injury, gliosis, or damage to the myelin sheath, and it also describes inflammatory changes and involvement of the arachnoid cell layers. Physiologic neurotoxicity of spinal drugs includes changes in spinal cord blood flow, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in the electrophysiology of impulse conduction. Behavioral and clinical signs of neurotoxicity include pain, motor and sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Ideally, a complete roster of histological, physiologic, and behavioral testing would be performed on spinal drugs in several animal species, followed by safety trials in humans before widespread use. In practice, drugs have taken a variety of roads from conception to application, and often without safety data. In this article, we review available neurotoxicity data on drugs that have a clinical application, classified as spinal local anesthetics, spinal analgesics, or spinal adjuvants. Spinal Local Anesthetics The 100-yr history of spinal local anesthetic use in humans has typically involved self-experimentation, followed by widespread application with little or no controlled testing for neurotoxicity. Bier and Hildebrant [1] initially performed spinal anesthesia with cocaine on themselves in 1898, and essentially all of the earliest local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia were introduced in this fashion without toxicity studies. Despite a long history of clinical use, recent interest in neurotoxicity has arisen due to concerns over reports of cauda equina syndrome and transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) from spinal local anesthetics. We review animal data that have been used to assess the neurotoxicity of local anesthetics and summarize data available from human studies. In 1985, Ready et al. [2] evaluated the neurotoxic effects of single injections of local anesthetics in rabbits. They reported that spinal cord histopathology remained normal and that persistent neurologic deficits were not seen with clinically used concentrations of tetracaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chlorprocaine. However, histopathologic changes and neurologic deficits did occur with higher concentrations of tetracaine (1%) and lidocaine (8%). In this model, extensive neurologic impairment was not necessarily accompanied by equally extensive lesions in the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus demonstrating the need for multiple models to fully assess neurotoxicity. Recent studies have used desheathed peripheral nerve models, designed to mimic unprotected nerve roots in the cauda equina, to further assess electrophysiologic neurotoxicity of clinically relevant concentrations of local anesthetics [3-5]. These models demonstrate that clinically used concentrations of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% tetracaine cause irreversible conduction block, whereas 1.5% lidocaine, 0.75% bupivacaine, and 0.06% tetracaine do not. Electrophysiologic toxicity of lidocaine in these models is concentration-dependent (Figure 1) beginning at 40 mM (approximately 1%) with irreversible ablation of the compound action potential at 80 mM (approximately 2%). Kanai et al. [4] subsequently demonstrated that generation of action potentials was more vulnerable than maintenance of resting membrane potential and that irreversible ablation of action and resting membrane potential by lidocaine seems to be both concentration- and time-dependent.Figure 1: The nonreversible effect of 40 mM lidocaine on the compound action potential (CAP) of frog sciatic nerve. Lidocaine was applied to a stable nerve preparation for 15 min, then washed with frog Ringer's solution for 2 h. Tracings represent CAPs in response to stimuli (1-Hz stimulus = heavy line, 40-Hz stimulus = thin line). Lidocaine 40 mM completely ablated the CAP when applied to the nerve. The 1-Hz CAP response began to return after 10-15 min of washing and reached a new level in 45 min, where it was stable for the subsequent 2 h of observation. The recovered 1-Hz CAP is only 65% of the original. Reprinted with the publisher's permission from Holman SJ. Anesthesiology: hyperbaric dye solution distribution. Anesthesiology 1997;86:969.Effects of local anesthetics on spinal cord blood flow seem benign. Spinal administration of bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine causes vasodilation and increase spinal cord blood flow [6,7], whereas ropivacaine causes concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and reduction in spinal cord blood flow [6]. However, the effects of lidocaine on blood flow of in vitro peripheral nerve models are more concerning. Myers et al. [8] applied solutions of isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1% and 2% lidocaine with and without epinephrine, and epinephrine alone to isolated rat sciatic nerve and measured changes in blood flow with a laser Doppler flow probe. Blood flow was significantly depressed for all solutions except isotonic sodium chloride solution. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow, and, when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by local anesthetics alone. Although experimental studies in animals have provided ample evidence that some local anesthetics in clinically relevant concentrations can injure nerve tissue, the exact mechanisms of injury are unclear. Recent work on neuronal cell lines has attempted to determine the mechanism of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Johnson and Uhl [9] have shown that direct application of 2.5%-5.0% lidocaine caused a >3-fold increase in intracellular calcium and up to a 20% incidence of cell death during 60 min of exposure in the neuronal cell line. They postulated that the mechanism of neurotoxicity was not likely from sodium channel blockade, because such a block would not lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Subsequent work in this model determined that 0.5% and 1.0% lidocaine, as well as 0.625% bupivacaine, lead to transient, moderate increases in calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum, without cell death [10]. Thus, several different laboratory models have proven that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic but that lidocaine and tetracaine are potentially more neurotoxic than bupivacaine (Table 1).Table 1: Local Anesthetic ToxicityDespite the knowledge that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic in the laboratory model, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics in humans (Table 2). Retrospective [11], prospective [12], and historical studies [13-15] report 0%-0.7% incidence of postoperative neurologic injury in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Although lacking a denominator, information from closed-claims databases corroborate these findings [16,17]. Thus, the neurotoxic potential of spinally administered local anesthetics has not manifested itself in large-scale studies.Table 2: Large Epidemiologic Studies of the Neurologic Complications of Spinal AnesthesiaThere are few nonepidemiologic clinical studies evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics, and all have focused on electrophysiologic variables after spinal anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials, monosynaptic H-reflex [18], and cutaneous current perception thresholds [19] have been used to evaluate recovery after spinal anesthesia. These measurements have shown complete return to baseline activity after 5% lidocaine spinal anesthesia in very small study populations. Histopathologic or other physiologic data in humans are lacking; thus, information from controlled studies in humans is essentially not available. Lidocaine Controversy about the use of single-injection spinal lidocaine began in 1993 when Schneider et al. [20] published four cases of short-lived neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. This was the first report to question the potential for neurotoxicity with standard clinical doses and concentrations of lidocaine after single-injection spinal anesthesia. Subsequent prospective, randomized studies reveal a 4%-33% incidence of TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia (Table 3) [21,22]. This incidence varies with the type of surgical procedure and is unaffected by baricity or the dilution of lidocaine to 0.5%. Contemporary reports of cauda equina syndrome after continuous lidocaine spinal anesthesia and the potential concentration-dependent neurotoxicity of lidocaine have led several authors to label TNS as a manifestation of subclinical neurotoxicity.Table 3: Incidence of Transient Neurologic Symptoms (TNS) with Spinal Anesthesia in Prospective Randomized StudiesAs previously discussed, laboratory work in both intrathecal and desheathed peripheral nerve models has proven that the concentration of lidocaine is a critical factor in neurotoxicity. Because concentrations of lidocaine <40 mM (approximately 1.0%) are not neurotoxic to desheathed peripheral nerve, such dilute concentrations of spinal lidocaine should not cause TNS if the syndrome is caused by subclinical concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. We recently examined whether spinal lidocaine concentrations of <1.0% might therefore decrease the incidence of TNS [21]. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy were randomized to receive 50 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine as either a 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% solution. There was no difference in the incidence of TNS (18%) among the three groups. The high incidence of TNS with lidocaine concentrations <1%, despite further dilution in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to lessen the plausibility of a concentration-dependent neurotoxic etiology. Other potential etiologies for TNS include patient positioning, early mobilization, needle trauma, neural ischemia, pooling of local anesthetics secondary to maldistribution by pencil-point needles or the addition of glucose, muscle spasm, myofascial trigger points, and irritation of dorsal ganglia [21]. The etiology of TNS is undetermined, and further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In summary, local anesthetics all have the potential to be neurotoxic, particularly in concentrations and doses larger than those used clinically. In histopathologic, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and neuronal cell models, lidocaine and tetracaine seem to have a greater potential for neurotoxicity than bupivacaine at clinically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics. Spinal Analgesics There is a complex system of different receptors for the transmission and inhibition of nociception in the spinal cord. These receptors include [micro sign]1-opioid receptors, alpha2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, gamma-amino butyric acid agonist (GABA) receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides substance P and somatostatin function as activators and inhibitors of nociception, respectively, and arachidonic acid metabolites enhance pain transmission [23]. Drugs that have been administered spinally in humans are thought to act directly or indirectly within this array of agonists and receptor sites (Figure 2). For each drug, the animal safety data and the human safety data are presented and summarized in Table 4.Figure 2: Schematic of mechanisms and sites of actions of spinal analgesics. mu-1 = opioid receptor, m1 = muscarinic type I acetylcholine receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, alpha2 = adrenergic receptor, NE = norepinephrine, GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAr = GABA receptor, NMDAr = N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NK-1r = neurokinin 1 receptor, NSAIDS = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, + and unshaded arrows = activation, - and black arrows = inhibition.Table 4: Evidence of Neurotoxicity of Spinal AnalgesicsOpioids Hydrophilic Opioids. Dogs and cats exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal morphine for several weeks through indwelling catheters showed no abnormal histopathology of the spinal cord under light microscopy [24,25]. Spinal cord blood flow is unaffected by 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine in dogs [26]. Consistent with a lack of histologic or physiologic neurotoxicity, behavioral effects reported in rats receiving 10-100 [micro sign]g/kg intrathecal morphine did not include evidence of neurotoxicity [27]. Limited postmortem neurohistopathology studies in patients with cancer after long-term, continuous intrathecal infusions containing morphine failed to definitively implicate the drug (with metabisulfite preservative) in any histopathologic abnormalities [28,29]. Electrophysiologic study of spinal morphine is limited to examination of somatosensory evoked potentials, which are unchanged despite intense analgesia [30]. No clinical abnormalities attributable to intrathecal morphine were reported in these studies. Spinal meperidine has undergone no published preclinical animal neurotoxicity testing. In humans, spinal meperidine has been reported as an effective sole drug for surgical anesthesia without noted clinical neuropathology, but no formal neurotoxicity testing has been undertaken [31]. Spinal hydromorphone has not been safety tested in animals. A single report describes hydromorphone administered spinally with clonidine in a woman with cancer pain without postmortem evidence of abnormal neurohistopathology [32]. Lipophilic Opioids. In its present preservative-free, commercially available form, fentanyl is commonly administered spinally. However, fentanyl is also notably absent from animal safety testing data. Histopathologic studies of isolated rabbit vagus nerve axons bathed in test solution failed to show evidence of localized neural damage with fentanyl dissolved in isotonic solution. Potential electrophysiologic neurotoxicity was reported with the commercially available hypotonic solution of fentanyl, which caused permanent conduction deficits comparable to water alone [33]. In vivo, only relatively large doses of fentanyl citrate would be expected to create a hypotonic intrathecal environment. Controlled human safety data are also minimal with spinal fentanyl. There are no published reports specifically addressing the histologic, physiologic, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal fentanyl. No report of persistent neurologic complications was retrieved from a MEDLINE search, despite widespread clinical use of spinal fentanyl. Sufentanil was administered to cats with indwelling intrathecal catheters for 5 days without distinguishable neurohistopathological abnormalities [27]. Similarly, dogs exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal sufentanil for several weeks also showed no abnormal histopathology [24]. However, sheep exposed to large (approximately 50 [micro sign]g) and very large (approximately 200 [micro sign]g) doses of sufentanil every 6 h for 3 days through intrathecal catheters showed evidence of dose-dependent spinal cord histopathology [34]. These findings may reflect a neurotoxic effect at large doses or quite possibly an artifact of the experimental design due to the frequent, large-volume, hypotonic preparation used in this study. No studies of spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology are available. The rats, cats, and dogs used in the above experiments had no persistent behavioral deficits. The sheep demonstrated dose-dependent agitation and hind-limb motor deficits that resolved spontaneously. There is no formal human neurotoxicity testing of sufentanil, but there are also no clinical reports of neurological impairment from widespread use. The spinal administration of alfentanil to cats for 5 days and to dogs for several weeks through indwelling intrathecal catheters induced no abnormal histopathology [24]. There are no reports of human experience with intrathecal alfentanil. Spinal remifentanil has been studied for efficacy in rats, but no histopathology has been published [35]. Rat behavior changes, other than sedation, were not reported, and recovery was not described. There is no published human experience with spinal remifentanil. Partial Opioid Receptor Agonists. In the sheep experiments with sufentanil noted above, butorphanol given intrathecally as a commercial solution of citrate and tartate salts caused florid histologic and behavioral pathology, whereas nalbuphine in saline was associated with minimal inflammatory histologic changes, mild neuronal changes at large doses, and transient hindlimb weakness [34]. No other animal or human data are available. In summary, laboratory studies and extensive clinical experience with morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil can reasonably assure the safety of limited intrathecal doses of these drugs. Other opioid agonists or partial agonists are without animal and human safety testing data. alpha2 Receptor Agonists Clonidine is the predominant spinal alpha2-agonist. Extensive preclinical tests in animals produced no neurohistopathologic abnormalities in rats, dogs, sheep, or monkeys. Spinal cord blood flow studies in rats, pigs, and awake sheep reveal perturbations that, on the whole, do not suggest significant decreases under normal clinical circumstances. No behavioral abnormalities suggesting neurotoxicity have been associated with intrathecal clonidine [36]. There has been extensive and graded exposure of humans to spinal clonidine (>968 surgical, obstetrical, and chronic pain patients) with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [36]. Although no histopathologic or physiologic studies have been reported, clonidine seems to be a safe spinal drug in humans. Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors Neostigmine indirectly produces a muscarinic agonist effect by inhibiting acetycholinesterase and has been shown to cause analgesia in animal and human experiments. Neurohistopathological analysis of rats and dogs after long-term intrathecal neostigmine (with and without paraben preservatives) administration reveal no spinal cord toxicity [37,38]. Neostigmine does not affect spinal cord blood flow in sheep [37], and there were no behavioral changes suggesting neurotoxicity reported in the above animal studies. Phase I safety assessments in human volunteers have been performed for both preservative-free (50-750 [micro sign]g) and paraben-containing hyperbaric preparations (10-100 [micro sign]g) of spinal neostigmine without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [40,41]. Although the human experience with spinal neostigmine is limited, clinical trials performed thus far have not reported any evidence of neurologic sequelae. gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Agonists (Table 5) Midazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam is soluble in an aqueous solution when buffered to approximately pH 3.5. At physiologic pH, midazolam becomes lipophilic, facilitating tissue penetration. These characteristics have made midazolam the most extensively studied spinal benzodiazepine. Neurotoxicity studies in animals have yielded conflicting results. Four initial rat studies with intrathecal catheter implantation using 0.15 mg/kg for 15 days (two studies) or isolated exposures to 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of midazolam (two studies) prepared in saline solution showed no neurotoxic reactions on light or electron microscopy [42]. However, a subsequent study in rabbits after a single 0.1 mg/kg intrathecal injection of midazolam reported that three of nine animals (33%) showed spinal cord histopathologic changes 8 days after exposure [43]. The diffuse nature of the histopathologic abnormalities that uncharacteristically extended from cervical to lumbar sections, the presence of significant and persistent diastolic hypotension in the treatment group, and the delayed postmortem tissue fixation all suggest a possible systemic source of artifact in the three affected animals. To investigate these contrasting results, a state-of-the-art study on the rat was performed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, cell morphometry, and transcardial tissue fixation after daily intrathecal administration of approximately 0.3 mg/kg midazolam for 20 days [44]. The spinal cords showed strong evidence of neuronal death and cellular abnormalities, even on light microscopy, in most midazolam-treated rats. Of note, a hypotonic commercial preparation of midazolam was used in contrast to the isotonic saline preparation used in all previous reports. Hypotonicity results in permanent nerve injury in isolated nerve preparations [33] and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of spinal sufentanil in sheep [45]. Although hypotonicity may be the etiology of the reported abnormalities, intrinsic neurotoxicity of spinal midazolam is a consideration.Table 5: Comparative Animal and Human Toxicity Data of Common Spinal AdjuvantsNo animal studies on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology have been reported. The effect of midazolam on blood-brain barrier integrity was investigated in the above-described study on rabbits and showed compromise in three of nine animals [43]. Despite some histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity, no significant behavioral abnormalities have been reported in any of the animal neurotoxicity studies of intrathecal midazolam. There are no histologic or physiologic studies of humans exposed to spinal midazolam, although there are seven small reports of intrathecal midazolam for anesthesia and pain management. Within this limited human experience, there are no reports of clinical neurologic deficit, even after prolonged continuous intrathecal use in four patients with chronic benign pain syndromes [46]. Midazolam neurotoxicity is controversial. Although the commercial midazolam solution seems to be neurotoxic in rats, hypotonicity of the solution may be culpable, rather than the drug itself. Midazolam in saline does not seems to be neurotoxic in the rat, but it may be toxic in the rabbit. There are insufficient studies in humans to determine the risk of neurotoxicity with spinal midazolam. Baclofen Spinal spasticity, which is thought to result from disinhibition of motor horn cells after upper motor neuron damage, can be treated with baclofen. Baclofen is a stable analog of GABA and interacts primarily with the inhibitory GABA-B receptors in lamina 2 of the dorsal horn (Figure 1). Twenty-eight dogs exposed to chronic spinal delivery of either saline, clinical, or supraclinical doses of baclofen showed no neurohistopathologic changes. Cats exposed to intrathecal baclofen for 8 days likewise showed no abnormal spinal cord histopathology [47]. No studies on spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology have been published with regards to intrathecal baclofen. Neither dogs, cats, nor monkeys showed behavioral evidence of neurotoxicity [25]. There are no published human studies evaluating histopathologic or physiologic neurotoxicity of baclofen. Spinal baclofen was infused in seven subjects for 3-22 mo without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [48]. An extensive review of cases involving intrathecal baclofen overdose did not note any long-term sequelae [49]. Based on animal studies and considerable clinical experience, spinal baclofen is not likely to cause neurologic damage. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonists Ketamine. Animal studies examining the neurotoxicity of ketamine generally support its safety, with the exception of some poorly explained findings. Studies performed in monkeys, baboons, and rabbits after single-dose intrathecal ketamine injections (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) with and without benzethonium chloride preservative did not uncover histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity [50,51]. In contrast, two other rat studies reported histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal ketamine. One study found vacuolization of the ganglion cells in posterior nerve roots in 3 of 33 rats that died immediately on injection of preservative-free ketamine [52]. However, it is difficult to ascribe these findings to ketamine neurotoxicity given the uncertain circumstances of demise. Similarly, another rat study with single intrathecal injections of 2.5 mg of ketamine hydrochloride with the preservative benzethonium chloride reported that two of six rats had radicular demyelination injury at sites distant from the injections on histological examination [53]. However, more than half of the animals in the ketamine treatment group either died after rapid injection (two rats) or had single hindlimb paralysis after injection (four rats), which puts the validity of the results in question. No animal studies have been published on the effect of spinal ketamine on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology. Rabbits showed a pattern of blood-brain barrier compromise differing significantly from that of saline-injected control rabbits after single 3-mg injections of ketamine with chlorbutanol [43] but not with preservative-free ketamine [50]. The neurotoxicity of spinal ketamine is largely untested in humans, despite a few case series reporting ketamine use for spinal anesthesia and analgesia [54]. Taken together, the rat, rabbit, and primate studies with intrathecal ketamine support its safety if used without a preservative. A small preliminary human experience suggests that the anesthetic is well tolerated. However, the commercially available preparation of ketamine contains an untested preservative (benzethonium chloride) and cannot be recommended for intrathecal use in humans. Amitriptyline. Preclinical animal testing of intrathecal amitriptyline is limited to a physiologic assessment in adult sheep [55]. A range of intrathecal doses (0.25, 1, or 5 mg) with a maximal dose representing approximately 25-50 times the anticipated human dose did not reduce spinal cord blood flow. No behavioral abnormalities were reported except for transient agitation with the injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline. The injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline into the cervical intrathecal space sedated the animals for 10-60 min, whereas 10 mg produced intense sedation and seizure, followed by death from uncertain causes in one animal. Long-term exposure and neurohistopathologic studies are reported to be in progress [55]. The determination of amitriptyline neurotoxicity awaits further investigation. Somatostatin In rats, intrathecal somatostatin (SST) produced marked, dose-dependent neurotoxic responses at or near doses required to produce analgesia [56] with similar findings in cats and mice [57]. SST administered in similar doses to guinea pigs, in contrast, did not provoke significant neurohistopathological changes [58]. Spinal SST in rats had significant vasoconstrictive effects in the spinal cord and brain, leading to reduced blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and compromised blood-brain barrier [59]. No spinal cord blood flow changes were seen in the guinea pig. Significant behavioral changes were noted in the rat, cat, and mouse experiments, but not in the guinea pig experiments. Species differences in the neurotoxic susceptibility to SST may explain these differences, but there is evidence for neurotoxicity in several animal species. In humans, spinal SST has been offered to terminally ill patients. Four patients with intractable cancer pain were studied after daily injections of spinal SST. Postmortem histopathology was undertaken on the spinal cords of two patients. One showed moderate degeneration of some dorsal roots within the cauda equina, whereas the other demonstrated no histopathologic changes. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were not discussed [60]. In summary, SST has been shown to be neurotoxic in rats, mice, and cats at doses comparable to those that confer analgesia. In humans, relatively small doses of SST have been anecdotally reported to variably relieve pain in the absence of overt neurologic sequelae. Based on this demonstrated record of neurotoxicity in several animal species, spinal SST should be considered a last-line analgesic only in the terminally ill patient. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Prostaglandins are involved in the spinal cord facilitation of pain processing, and spinal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can abolish wind-up behavior in animals [61]. Although the analgesic efficacy of spinal ketorolac has been established, no animal neurotoxicity studies have been published [61]. However, the 10% alcohol solvent used for commercial preparations is potentially neurotoxic, and commercial ketorolac should not be used spinally. Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) dosed intrathecally has been shown to be antinociceptive and has been tested in the rat for neurotoxicity with conflicting results. Although limited technically by a >50% spinal cord trauma rate related to needle puncture, one rat study reported radicular demyelination injury in one of the seven undamaged rats (14%) who received intrathecal L-ASA [53]. In contrast, neither histopathologic abnormalities nor a persistent decrease in spinal cord blood flow were seen in another rat study with large daily doses of L-ASA for at least 14 days [62]. The initial study described aggressive behavioral changes in rats after the spinal injection of L-ASA, leading to death from combat. The subsequent study did not report behavioral findings.

Estas células son de gran importancia ya que llevan la información a los músculos del cuerpo. Debido a la degeneración de neuronas motoras piramidales en la corteza motora, neuronas del tallo cerebral y neuronas del asta anterior en la médula espinal inducen la aparición de enfermedades motoras que producen atrofia progresiva de los músculos. Así, cuando se dañan estas células nerviosas, se presentan diferentes enfermedades motoras “raras” como: la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica, la esclerosis lateral primaria, la atrofia muscular espinal, síndrome de Guillain-Barré, la atrofia muscular espinal-bulbar y el síndrome pospoliomielítico, entre otros. Las patologías motoras pueden tener un origen congénito, genético o ambiental (viral, por fármacos o esporádico). Aunque estas enfermedades motoras se consideran poco comunes, son de gran importancia ya que los pacientes no logran recuperarse por la progresión de la enfermedad, lo que conlleva al fallecimiento. Esta revisión, analiza una serie de estudios clínicos de los últimos 20 años en estas patologías motoras para comprender mejor su etiología, diagnóstico y tratamientos, como el uso de células madre en la producción de oligodendrocitos que producen mielina, el cual es un factor clave en las enfermedades motoras y la utilización de antioxidantes que pueden ser la clave para obtener resultados prometedores que tiene como objetivo mantener la esperanza de vida en los sujetos que las padecen.",

Most individuals have accompanying left cerebral hemisphere lesions or have a pathologic disruption between cerebral and cerebellar speech centers. Individuals who experience cerebrovascular accidents are particularly susceptible to FAS. It has been reported that problems with articulation and comprehension can eventually lead to FAS. Psychogenic FAS is sometimes considered a subcategory of conversion disorder and has common comorbid psychiatric conditions including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia and can present with additional conversion disorders.

      "title": "Comparative Clinical and Electroencephalographic Studies of Canine Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Clinical and electroencephalographic observations of 70 epileptic dogs are reported. Sixty‐nine dogs underwent generalized motor seizures. Typically, these consisted of loss of consciousness, generalized tonic‐clonic convulsions, and autonomic signs ( e.g. urination, salivation, or defecation). Some dogs also had partial motor seizures with rapid generalization. A wide variety of behavioral signs were observed in 33 of the dogs. These signs were usually evident before or after generalized tonic‐clonic convulsions or as separate episodes in dogs which also had tonic‐clonic convulsions. One dog underwent only paroxysmal behavioral signs. One or more abnormalities were observed in the interictal EEG's of 50 dogs. Thirty‐eight had diffuse paroxysmal dysrhythmias and 24 had focal paroxysmal dysrhythmias. Eighteen dogs had diffuse persistent dysrhythmias (all were slow dysrhythmias), and one dog had a focal persistent dysrhythmia. The following types of dysrhythmias were noted: spikes, spike complexes, wave and spike complexes, sharp waves and slow waves. Both chlorpromazine and photic stimulation appeared to be effective in activating EEG abnormalities. Trauma and/or hydrocephalus were possible causative factors in some cases, however, no cause was apparent in 46 of the dogs. The genealogy of one family of dogs strongly suggested inheritance of epilepsy or at least a predisposition to seizures. The data indicate that naturally occurring canine epilepsy is a suitable biological model of human epilepsy and, thus, warrants further study. RÉSUMÉ On présente les observations cliniques et électroencéphalographiques de 70 chiens épileptiques, dont 69 chiens ont présenté des convulsions motrices géneralisées, caractérisées par une perte de connaissance, des secousses géneralisées tonico‐cloniques et des manifestations végétatives (par example miction, salivation, défécation). Quelques chiens aussi ont présenté des crises motrices partielles qui se sont rapidement géneralisées. On a observé une grande variété de manifestations du comportement chez 33 chiens. Ces manifestations étaient généralement évidentes avant ou après les convulsions généralisées tonico‐cloniques ou se présentaient comme des épisodes indépendants chez des chiens qui avaient aussi des convulsions tonico‐cloniques. Un chien a présenté seulement des signes du comportement paroxystiques. On a observé chez 50 chiens une ou plusieurs anomalies E.E.G. interictiques caractérisées soit par une dysrythmie diffuse paroxystique (38 chiens), soit par des dysrythmies paroxystiques focales (24 chiens), soit par une dysrythmie diffuse continue et lente (18 chiens); un chien avait une dysrythmie lente focale. On a observé les formes d'anomalies suivantes: pointes, bouffées de pointes et de pointes ondes, pointes lentes et ondes lentes. La chlorpromazine et la stimulation photique semblaient activer les anomalies E.E.G. Si le trauma et/ou l'hyprocéphalie pouvaient être considérés comme des facteurs étiologiques dans quelques cas, dans la majorité (46 chiens)on n'a pas décelé de facteurs étiologiques. l'arbre généalogique d'une famille de chiens était en faveur d'une hérédité de l'épilepsie ou du moins de la prédisposition aux crises. l'épilepsie spontaneae qu'on observe chez le chien est un modèle biologique comparable à l'épilepsie chez l'homme et mérite des études ultérieures.",

      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

The criteria for the diagnosis have traditionally been based primarily on tests of intelligence, and this continues despite frequent challenges to the underlying assumptions. MR and corresponding termsmental sub normality and mental deficiency-refer to a heterogeneous group of conditions, most of which are genetic or chromosomal or reflect the consequences of intrauterine infection or iso immunization. Other biologic causes include anoxia at birth, other obstetric difficulties, as well as a relatively few postnatal events, such as sequelae of central nervous system infection or injury, anoxia from repeated or prolonged convulsions, and a variety of other causes including degenerative diseases (such as Tay-Sachs) and toxic encephalopathies (such as lead poisoning). A large proportion of cases of MR have, however, no known origin.",

A typical executive task can be defined as the capacity to maintain one’s attention on the current task, that is, responding only to the correct but not to distractive stimuli. Impairments of executive functions, or executive dysfunctions, have a growing impact on everyday life and academic achievement and are usually an early feature, and one of the core features, in brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that memory therapeutics cannot achieve their clinical benefits in cognition if executive dysfunction is not effectively and simultaneously treated. Improvement of executive functions might be achieved through targeting some signaling pathways in the brain, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. These agents may be useful either as stand-alone interventions for patients with executive dysfunction and/or psychiatric and memory disorders or as essential adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology in various brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders.",

En cuanto a su fisiopatología, esta se deriva de dos momentos, el primero por un proceso de isquemia cerebral aguda y déficit de energía y oxígeno; el segundo, por un proceso de desequilibrios metabólicos, neurotransmisores y factores endocrinos donde los efectos inhibidores de neuroesteroides (adenosina, alopregnanolona, pregnolona y prostaglandina D2) siguen presentes posterior al nacimiento y se cree que son parcialmente los responsables de la alteración de conciencia.

These outbursts may terminate in an epileptic fit. There is an excess in the reaction, with inadequate adaptation to the situation so remote from a well-considered purposeful act that it approaches a pure psychic reflex act in the shape of an almost or entirely unmodified explosion not unlike a convulsion. The explosive diathesis is not characteristic of head injuries, but is also found in hereditary degeneration, in alcoholic degeneration, etc.”",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

It seems to make little or no difference whether the individual suffers from the mild or the severer type of convulsions, sooner or later he will show deterioration of the intellect, or the periodic occurrence of graver forms of insanity. Nevertheless, it may be stated as a general rule that the earlier the disease comes on, the greater the liability to mental deterioration and the more rapid the failure, while in those persons in whom the attacks begin in later years of life, the deteriorating process is much slower, owing to the stability of the nerve tracks acquired in infancy and youth. Epileptics who have had fits for years show a dimming of the reasoning faculties, defects of memory, alternations of character, a sinking to a lower plane of intelligence, and above all a tendency to impulsiveness and irritability. To this rule there are but infrequent exceptions. In many instances of the disease the epileptic is irritable even to violence, unmanageable, careless of the feelings of his family and friends, and is among the most difficult of mental cases to handle. As a general rule it may be stated that the more frequent the seizures, the more rapid the mental deterioration. There are, however, cases who have a great many attacks and who hold up mentally in a surprising manner in spite of the frequent assaults on the nervous system; again, there are cases with very infrequent seizures who deteriorate with great rapidity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The developmental amnesia is a recently known entity that occurs as a consequence of hypoxic-ischemic events in the perinatal period. This is a specific deficit of episodic memory with greater preservation of semantic memory and other memory components such as the immediate and working memory. It occurs in patients without apparent neurological sequelae, with normal psychomotor development and general intelligence. The developmental amnesia has been associated with bilateral involvement of the hippocampus, which is evident in some cases on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as signal disturbance and signs of atrophy, or reduced size of the hippocampus in brain volumetric studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS We present six observations of developmental amnesia, their clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings. RESULTS All of them show impaired episodic memory with preservation of semantic memory, have a normal general intelligence and follow a regular school with special educational needs. CONCLUSIONS It is necessary to keep in mind this entity in monitoring risk newborns by their perinatal history and include the exploration of memory in neuropsychological study of these subjects. On the other hand, we highlight the specificity of the clinical and neuropsychological profile for the diagnosis of developmental amnesia even in the absence of hippocampal lesions on conventional MRI.",

In one fifth of the migraineurs, a neurological disturbance (visual, sensory or motor) appears during or before the development of the headache called migraine aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a transient neuronal depolarization that spreads across unilateral hemisphere from a focus and is followed by a long-lasting depression of neuronal activity. CSD was proposed to be the underlying phenomenon of the migraine aura as it propagates at a similar velocity with visual scotomata and the transient cortical oligemia seen in migraineurs during the aura phase. This data, enabling a better understanding of migraine pathophysiology, will result in new insights into the treatment of other neurological disorders such as cerebrovascular disorders, transient global amnesia, traumatic brain injury, in whose pathophysiology CSD is supposed to take part, beside the treatment of migraine itself.",

Therapeutic hypothermia decreases free radical produc-tion, inflammation, excitotoxicity and intracranial pressure, and improves cerebral metabolism after traumatic brain injury and cerebral ischemia, thus protecting against central nervous system dam-age. Although a series of pathological and physiological changes as well as potential side effects are observed during hypothermia treatment, it remains a potential therapeutic strategy for central nervous system injuries and deserves further study.",

      "abstract": "There are approximately 1.4 million cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) per year in the United States, with about 23 000 survivors requiring hospitalization. The incidence of TBI has increased in the patient population of the Department of Defense and Veterans Healthcare Administration as a result of injuries suffered during recent military and combat operations. Within the past few years, TBI has emerged as a common form of injury in service members with a subset of patients experiencing postinjury symptoms that greatly affect their quality of life. Traumatic brain injury can occur when sudden trauma (ie, penetration blast or blunt) causes damage to the brain. Traumatic brain injury produces a cascade of potentially injurious processes that include focal contusions and cytotoxic damage. The results of TBI can include impaired physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning, which may or may not require the initiation of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions when deemed appropriate. Associated outcomes of TBI include alterations in mental state at the time of injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, and alteration of consciousness). Neurological deficits include loss of balance, praxis, aphasia, change in vision that may or may not be transient. Individuals who sustain a TBI are more likely to have or developed co-occurring conditions (ie, sleep problems, headaches, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder) that may require the administration of multiple medications. It has been identified that veterans being discharged on central nervous system and muscular skeletal drug classes can develop addiction and experience medication misadventures. With the severity of TBI being highly variable but typically categorized as either mild, moderate, or severe, it can assist health care providers in determining which patients are more susceptible to medication misadventures compared with others. The unique development of cognitive and emotional symptoms of TBI can lead to significant impairments, so it is important for all health care providers, including pharmacists, to promote proper use of high-risk psychotropic medications among this patient population by providing effective medication education.",

      "abstract": "A number of mental disorders comprise aberrant perceptions that are often described as possessing a perceptual quality approaching real-life sensory experience, while at the same time lacking a sensory correlate in the real world. Healthy individuals can also have perceptual experience without an external correlate when they engage in mental imagery. Aberrant perceptions differ from mental imagery in their lack of voluntary control and the sense of reality. Early theories suggested that increased imagery vividness could lead to aberrant perceptions in a number of clinical disorders. However, cognitive and neuroimaging studies do not endorse this view, and instead suggest that mental imagery comprises a functional architecture that is at least partly shared with memory and perception. Miscommunication or disconnection between brain areas or functional modules within this architecture may give rise to aberrant perceptions and their sense of reality. We describe the evidence for this view in relation to psychotic hallucinations in schizophrenia, hallucinations in neurodegenerative disorders and flashbacks of traumatic events in post-traumatic stress disorder. We suggest that an impaired neural architecture of imagery, rather than merely increased intensity or vividness of imagery, underlies aberrant perceptions. This view fits with neurobiological models of mental disorders that suggest that psychopathological symptoms arise from disrupted communication between brain areas.",

The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Neuromyositis defined as the association of dermatomyositis or polymyositis and a neuropathy without any found cause is a very controversial entity because of the possibility of, in one hand, muscular modifications caused by neurological involvement and, on the other hand, neurogenic type manifestations caused by polymyositis. The study of 4 cases seen in an Internal Medicine department and the review of the literature allowed us to show that the concept of neuromyositis corresponds to a clinico-pathological reality when the diagnosis is based on the association of definite criteria of both primary muscle and nerve involvement excluding muscular abnormalities that could be the consequence of nerve involvement and vice versa. The criteria, most relevant when associated are: a) for muscular involvement: high increase of muscular enzyme over 6 times the superior limit of the normal values, pseudomyotonic electrical discharges, perifascicular atrophy, intense inflammatory infiltrates and massive necrosis, b) for neurological involvement: early abolition of tendinous reflexes in a patient without notable muscular atrophy and with little or no myalgia, sensitive abnormalities in areas other than those of muscular involvement, especially when they are intense, early weakness of distal muscles, decrease of nerve conduction speed, target fibers and lesions of nerve trunks (and albuminocytological dissociation in the particular case of polyradiculoneuritis). Once the diagnosis of neuropathy settled, it is necessary to exclude an usual cause (alcoholism, diabetes...) before concluding to neuromyositis. When we apply these restrictive (but nevertheless necessary for the validity of diagnosis) criteria, only 6 cases of the literature respond to this entity. It is a peripheral neuropathy in 5 cases (like two of ours) and a polyradiculoneuritis in one case (like our two others). Among these 6 cases, there is a vasculitis in two, frequency much higher to what is observed in adult polymyositis, which suggest a possible causative role of vascular involvement in neuropathy arising. In the other cases we can just give pathogenic hypothesis making the neuropathy and the polymyositis the result of the same process (immunological disturbance, paraneoplastic origin, viral disease). In one of our four patients, who have shown an HTLV-I infection by polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization was positive in muscle which suggest a direct pathogenic role of the virus. HTLV-I infection should be considered as a possible cause of neuromyositis especially in endemic areas.",

HIE is a major cause of neurological disability and mortality in newborns, with over one million neonatal deaths occurring annually worldwide. The severity of brain injury and the outcome of HIE depend on several factors, including the cause of oxygen deprivation, brain maturity, regional blood flow, and maternal health conditions. HIE is classified into mild, moderate, and severe categories based on the extent of brain damage and resulting neurological issues. The pathophysiology of HIE involves different phases, including the primary phase, latent phase, secondary phase, and tertiary phase. The primary and secondary phases are characterized by episodes of energy and cell metabolism failures, increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and activated microglia and inflammation in the brain. A tertiary phase occurs if the brain injury persists, characterized by reduced neural plasticity and neuronal loss. Understanding the cellular and molecular aspects of the different phases of HIE is crucial for developing new interventions and therapeutics. This review aims to discuss the pathophysiology of HIE, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the only approved therapy for HIE, ongoing developments of adjuvants for TH, and potential future drugs for HIE.",

This article will address the common causes, diagnosis and management of iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries.\n\nThe most widely used classification of peripheral nerve injury is that described by Seddon in 1943.1 He divided nerve injuries into three types: neurapraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis.\n\nNeurapraxia (inactivity of the nerve) is a non-degenerative lesion of a nerve characterised by a complete or partial failure to propagate an action, potentially resulting in motor and/or sensory loss. It is usually caused by compression or ischaemia, resulting in ischaemia of the myelin sheath. The nerve remains intact and Wallerian degeneration does not occur. It is reversible if the injurious agent is removed. If the distal segment of the nerve is stimulated, there is a motor response. The lesion recovers by remyelination of the distal segment and takes between two and 12 weeks, depending on the age of the patient and the site of the injury.\n\nIn practice, it is unwise to assume that a lesion is a neurapraxia rather than a more severe injury because this will lead to delay in diagnosis and a poorer outcome. The presence of persistent pain suggests that the injurious agent is continuing to act. The diagnosis should not be made in the presence of a strong Tinel test which indicates that axons have been ruptured.\n\nAn axonotmesis (cutting of the axon) is the result of disruption of the axon and its myelin sheath. The supporting structures, Schwann cells, endoneurium, perineurium and epineurium remain intact. It is usually the result of severe compression or a crush injury. Wallerian degeneration occurs distally, and proximally to the closest node of Ranvier.

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too.

      "abstract": "Introduction “Electrolyte abnormalities are commonly encountered in daily clinical practice, and their diagnosis relies on routine laboratory results. Electrolyte disturbances can affect the brain among many other organs and tissues and must be promptly recognized, as they can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications if neglected or not appropriately treated. Neurological manifestations reflect the severity of acute neuronal dysfunction and thus require urgent treatment. Acute and/or severe electrolyte imbalances can manifest with rapidly progressive neurological symptoms, seizures, and psychiatric manifestations. They are more frequently observed in patients with sodium disorders (especially hyponatremia), hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Objectives Were the psychiatric manifestations secondary to hyponatremia or epilepsy? Or is it a comorbidity? What are the risk factors? And what is the appropriate course of action for this type of patient?” Methods We present, through a clinical case, the situation of a 64-year-old patient who experienced status epilepticus secondary to hyponatremia, requiring hospitalization in the neurology department. Subsequently, she developed psychiatric manifestations with a marked change in behavior. She began experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depressive mood, headaches, somatic complaints, and social isolation. Her condition gradually worsened, necessitating hospitalization in the psychiatry department 3 years later. Results The patient was placed on Carbamazepine by her neurologist, and since then, she has not experienced epileptic seizures. Her follow-up electrolyte panel initially showed slight disturbances before normalizing. Psychiatric manifestations were concurrent with these somatic symptoms and worsened over time. During her psychiatric hospitalization three years later, after a thorough evaluation, she was prescribed Sertraline ans Risperidone in combination with Carbamazepine, resulting in a significant improvement in her condition. Conclusions In summary, this case illustrates the critical impact of electrolyte abnormalities on both neurological and psychiatric health, especially in older patients. Understanding risk factors associated with electrolyte imbalances is crucial for effective diagnosis and management, particularly in the elderly. This underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address the potential serious consequences of electrolyte disturbances on overall patient well-being.

This definition has now been extended to include protection against neurodegeneration and neurotoxins. The extended definition includes interventions that slow or halt the progression of neuronal degeneration. This book will describe the natural mechanisms of neuroprotection, agents used as neuroprotectives, and therapeutic neuroprotection in all neurological disorders where there is danger of progression of neurological damage regardless of the pathological process or clinical features. Prophylactic neuroprotection during anesthesia and surgery is also discussed. Neuroprotection may also be used for prevention of progression of a disease if it can be identified at a presymptomatic stage. The term neuroprotective, although an adjective, will be used as a noun in preference to neuroprotectant.",

This neurosis may be latent as any other inherent tendency to neuropathic instability may be and often is, until some psychical or pathological cause calls it into morbid activity. While hysteria is essentially an imitative and functional disturbance of the peychomotor, sensory and ganglionic centers, it is no more unreasonable to expect its development in conjunction with grave organic lesions of the cord or brain, than to anticipate pain or spasm from profound central disease or even from multiple neuritis of the motor nerves extending to the cord centers or involving contiguous peripheral sensory nerve fibers.

      "title": "Epileptic seizures and headache/migraine: A review of types of association and terminology",
      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "La Esclerosis Multiple es una enfermedad neurologica clinicamente heterogenea donde los sintomas son producidos por mecanismos patogenicos inmunes en relacion a la inflamacion del Sistema Nervioso Central , desmielinizacion y degeneracion axonal, la causa es todavia desconocida. Afecta sobre todo a pacientes adultos jovenes en pleno desarrollo de sus actividades sociales, laborales y familiares, por lo que alteraciones en las funciones superiores cobran, si cabe, mayor importancia al interferir notablemente en la calidad de vida de los pacientes y de su entorno. El deterioro cognitivo severo es poco frecuente dentro de la enfermedad, los ultimos estudios hablan de menos del 5%. Sin embargo la presencia de DC ya en etapas iniciales de la enfermedad objetivado con diferentes test es de entre el 40 al 70% de los pacientes. El patron cognitivo muestra alteraciones en el razonamiento abstracto, problemas de atencion, velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y deficit de memoria reciente. El grado de deterioro se ha relacionado con la carga lesional y atrofia cerebral en resonancia magnetica , el tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad, el grado de discapacidad y se ha implicado tanto a sustancia blanca como a sustancia gris . Otros factores que pueden incidir en el rendimiento cognitivo de estos pacientes pueden ser la depresion y la fatiga, sintomas frecuentes en pacientes con EM. La homocisteina es un aminoacido que se sintetiza en el organismo a partir de la metionina, se ha demostrado que su nivel aumentado en plasma es un factor de riesgo independiente de ateroesclerosis y de enfermedad tromboembolica. Su aumento se produce principalmente por alteraciones geneticas en las enzimas encargadas de su produccion o bien por factores dieteticos. En los ultimos anos se ha investigado su posible relacion con el DC en varias enfermedades neurologicas como en la Enfermedad de Alzheimer o en la Enfermedad de Parkinson dado su efecto toxico a nivel de SNC a diferentes niveles de actuacion. En la EM tambien hay hallazgos que encuentran una posible relacion entre hiperhomocisteinemia y mayor grado de DC en estos pacientes. Parece interesante profundizar en dicha linea, dada la importancia del DC y su influencia en la calidad de vida de los pacientes .A partir de los resultados obtenidos en el estudio en las diferentes pruebas aplicadas y del posterior analisis estadistico realizado, podemos concluir: En nuestra muestra no se ha demostrado que pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Deterioro Cognitivo asocien niveles elevados de homocisteina. No se ha hallado ningun dominio cognitivo especifico afectado asociado a hiperhomocisteinemia. La fatiga y la depresion no se muestran como factores asociados al Deterioro Cognitivo. El 67 % de los pacientes han presentado Deterioro Cognitivo. Los dominios que se han visto mas afectados han sido la velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y la atencion. El test mas sensible para la deteccion de Deterioro Cognitivo en pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple ha resultado el Symbol Digit Modalities Test. No se han encontrado diferencias en cuanto a presencia de Deterioro Cognitivo entre pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Sindrome Clinico Aislado. Se ha asociado el Deterioro Cognitivo a mayor edad, menor nivel de estudios, formas progresivas de la Esclerosis Multiple, mayor tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad y discapacidad medida por la EDSS.",

Nystagmus, by definition, is involuntary eye movements off of fixation that are initiated by a slow phase. By contrast, nystagmoid movements are often saccades that interrupt fixation or have a fast phase followed by a slow phase. Types of nystagmoid eye movements include saccadic intrusions, such as square wave jerks and ocular flutter/opsoclonus, voluntary nystagmus, superior oblique myokymia, as well as the Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon. In addition, sensory intermittent exotropia is a clinical entity that should be on the differential when considering patients with involuntary eye movements, many of whom will also have a history of decreased visual acuity. Other ocular comorbidities in these patients include optic nerve and retinal pathology, as well possible neurological findings such as head trauma or demyelinating disease.",

Some neuromuscular diseases are also associated with central nervous system disease, such as ALS, but most are restricted to the peripheral nervous system. The multitude of possible sites of injury can make neuromuscular diseases difficult to diagnose.

He then shares several pearls in diagnosing and treating patients with specific neuromuscular diseases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s environment, is an artificial construction. In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders and the epilepsies share common etiologies and pathologies. The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Schizotypy refers to a set of personality traits thought to reflect the subclinical expression of the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia. Here, we review the cognitive and brain functional profile associated with high questionnaire scores in schizotypy. We discuss empirical evidence from the domains of perception, attention, memory, imagery and representation, language, and motor control. Perceptual deficits occur early and across various modalities. While the neural mechanisms underlying visual impairments may be linked to magnocellular dysfunction, further effects may be seen downstream in higher cognitive functions. Cognitive deficits are observed in inhibitory control, selective and sustained attention, incidental learning, and memory. In concordance with the cognitive nature of many of the aberrations of schizotypy, higher levels of schizotypy are associated with enhanced vividness and better performance on tasks of mental rotation. Language deficits seem most pronounced in higher-level processes. Finally, higher levels of schizotypy are associated with reduced performance on oculomotor tasks, resembling the impairments seen in schizophrenia. Some of these deficits are accompanied by reduced brain activation, akin to the pattern of hypoactivations in schizophrenia spectrum individuals. We conclude that schizotypy is a construct with apparent phenomenological overlap with schizophrenia and stable interindividual differences that covary with performance on a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks known to be impaired in schizophrenia. The importance of these findings lies not only in providing a fine-grained neurocognitive characterization of a personality constellation known to be associated with real-life impairments, but also in generating hypotheses concerning the aetiology of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Brain Damage in Aphasia",
      "abstract": "Abstract By definition, aphasia is the result of brain damage; therefore, a neuropathology of aphasia exists. Both the type of pathology and the location of the brain lesion are significant to the clinicians caring for an aphasic patient. Techniques that demonstrate lesion type and site are crucial to the neuropathology of aphasia. Several generalizations can be offered (Benson, 1979a): Aphasia is produced lry damage to brain structures. Neuropathological pro cesses that involve nonbrain portions of the nervous system (e.g., cranial nerves) and secondary neurological dysfunctions such as systemic or psychogenic disorders do not produce aphasic language syndromes. Metabolic and toxic disorders (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) produce a broad, overall disruption of brain function, not a focal aphasia. Also, because language loss, by definition, is a requirement for aphasia, congenital and developmental disorders in which language failed to develop cannot be considered sources of aphasia.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects around 70 million people in the world, which represents approximately 1%of the world population. Seizures are transitory episodes produced by excessive neuronal discharges. They are characterized bytransient behavioral changes that are caused by abnormal and excessive neuronal synchronization in the brain. These episodes canbe triggered by genetic or acquired factors that alter normal brain function such as autoimmune diseases, genetic mutations,encephalopathies, head trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, febrile seizures or statusepilepticus. Temporal lobe epilepsy is a seriousneurological disorder, which represents 60% to 70% of drug-resistant epilepsy, and is an important form of epilepsy acquired byany of the factors mentioned. Seizures can generate recurrent cycles of excitotoxicity and oxidative stress that cause neuronaldamage and cell death. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the endogenous antioxidant system and the overproduction ofreactive oxygen species (ROS), consequently, oxidation of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids occurs in the brain, resulting inapoptosis, proteopathies, mitochondrial dysfunction, glial cell activation and neuroinflammation. ROS are responsible for thegeneration of oxidative stress and could be involved in neuronal damage that contributes to the establishment of epileptogenesis andspontaneous seizures in patients and experimental models. The administration of agents with antioxidant and anti-inflammatoryproperties could represent a therapeutic alternative aimed at reducing oxidative stress during epileptogenesis or seizures to reducethe severity of the pathological processes involved, and thus attenuate the neurobiological consequences that occur in temporal lobeepilepsy.",

      "abstract": "La importancia de este trabajo radica en varios aspectos: en primer lugar, es importante tener en cuenta que el exito de la cirugia se ha valorado en terminos que el paciente quede libre de crisis, de que estas disminuyan considerablemente o disminuya la dosis y cantidad de medicacion. Si bien, tales parametros, indudablemente, demuestran algun nivel de mejoria, no son evidencia contundente sobre la condicion cognoscitiva del paciente. Esto se explica, porque se pueden encontrar pacientes con epilepsia farmacorresistente que cognoscitivamente estan bien, aunque presenten anormalidades en la actividad electrica del cerebro. Es decir, no todos los pacientes epilepticos presentan deterioro de la actividad cognoscitiva, pero la cirugia si puede causar danos en esta por que se extrae la parte media del hipocampo, que afecta directamente el lobulo temporal en el cual se encuentran las areas del lenguaje y la memoria. La condicion cognoscitiva, entendida como la actividad de la corteza cerebral, es la que nos permite la interaccion con el medio, facilita procesos de adaptacion y garantiza el aprendizaje y, en este sentido, es importante determinar tal condicion en los pacientes sometidos a cirugia de epilepsia. Si la condicion permanece estable, ello significaria que el paciente puede mantener o incluso mejorar su nivel de desempeno. Si la condicion mejora, ampliaria las perspectivas del paciente en cuanto a su nivel de desempeno en las diferentes areas. Si tal condicion ha desmejorado, crearia la necesidad de ofrecer programas de rehabilitacion cognoscitivas, de tal manera que puedan, por lo menos compensar, sus defectos. Por lo anterior, corroborar el exito de la cirugia, necesariamente implica conocer los efectos de tal intervencion sobre la cognicion, por el papel de esta sobre la calidad de vida del paciente. A pesar de que la disminucion de las crisis y la mejoria en la calidad de vida tienen gran importancia en la valoracion del resultado de este procedimiento; se conoce todavia muy poco sobre el efecto a largo plazo que este tiene sobre ellos. Esta es la oportunidad para arrojar luz sobre dichos aspectos. Lo que esta investigacion pretende es comprobar por medio del analisis estadistico, la validez y confiabilidad de los resultados, con el fin de determinar la eficacia y efectividad de los procedimientos empleados: Test de WADA y evaluacion neuropsicologica. Al igual servira como referencia cientifica y bibliografica, brindando informacion a las personas interesadas en el campo de la cirugia de epilepsia del lobulo temporal. Se trata de una nueva investigacion en la linea de la neuropsicologia que ha venido desarrollando la facultad de Psicologia de la Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, constituyendose en un punto de partida para futuros trabajos en este campo. Los resultados obtenidos, se constituiran en un aporte para retroalimentar la labor del equipo interdisciplinario del Instituto Neurologico de Antioquia (INDEA); en las areas de: neurologia, neurorradiologia, neuropsicologia y trabajo social, quienes a partir de estos datos podran maximizar los resultados con el minimo riesgo para los pacientes.",

      "abstract": "We present the results of the autopsy of a retired professional football player that revealed neuropathological changes consistent with long-term repetitive concussive brain injury. This case draws attention to the need for further studies in the cohort of retired National Football League players to elucidate the neuropathological sequelae of repeated mild traumatic brain injury in professional football.The patient's premortem medical history included symptoms of cognitive impairment, a mood disorder, and parkinsonian symptoms. There was no family history of Alzheimer's disease or any other head trauma outside football. A complete autopsy with a comprehensive neuropathological examination was performed on the retired National Football League player approximately 12 years after retirement. He died suddenly as a result of coronary atherosclerotic disease. Studies included determination of apolipoprotein E genotype.Autopsy confirmed the presence of coronary atherosclerotic disease with dilated cardiomyopathy. The brain demonstrated no cortical atrophy, cortical contusion, hemorrhage, or infarcts. The substantia nigra revealed mild pallor with mild dropout of pigmented neurons. There was mild neuronal dropout in the frontal, parietal, and temporal neocortex. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was evident with many diffuse amyloid plaques as well as sparse neurofibrillary tangles and tau-positive neuritic threads in neocortical areas. There were no neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex. Lewy bodies were absent. The apolipoprotein E genotype was E3/E3.This case highlights potential long-term neurodegenerative outcomes in retired professional National Football League players subjected to repeated mild traumatic brain injury. The prevalence and pathoetiological mechanisms of these possible adverse long-term outcomes and their relation to duration of years of playing football have not been sufficiently studied. We recommend comprehensive clinical and forensic approaches to understand and further elucidate this emergent professional sport hazard.",

      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the systemic circulation. Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

Systemic asphyxia resulting from a disruption in placental gas exchange occurs perinatally in 2–4 per 1000 full-term infants. Approximately 15–20% of infants who develop brain damage subsequently die during the newborn period, and up to 25% of survivors exhibit permanent neurological disabilities. Neurologic abnormalities, such as movement disorders (e.g., ataxia, choreoathetosis, diplegia, or dystonia), epilepsy, and developmental delay, are possible lifelong consequences that occur following perinatal HI. Preterm or term HI infants have damage in the forebrain and brain stem, with basal ganglia and somatosensory systems showing selective vulnerability. The mechanisms for this brain damage and the resulting neurologic disorders in newborns are still not understood. Unfortunately, no treatments for the prevention or amelioration of this neurologic injury are available for infants and children who have suffered HI.",

      "title": "Protecting axons in multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Typically patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience acute episodes of neurological dysfunction, which recover followed, at a later stage, by slow and insidious accumulation of disability (disease progression). Disease progression reflects axon damage and loss within the central nervous system. However, the precise mechanism of axon injury in MS is not clear. Inflammation occurring during acute relapses undoubtedly causes some degree of acute axon damage, but epidemiological data and treatment studies have suggested that inflammation alone is not the sole cause of axonopathy. Indeed, there appears to be dissociation between inflammation and disease progression once a certain level of clinical disability has been reached because immune suppression in patients who have established disease progression does not halt the slow decrease of function. The slow and insidious loss of neurological function that occurs during the progressive phase of the disease implies a degenerative process. Whether axon drop-out occurs at these later stages because of previous inflammatory damage to axons; because of low grade inflammation causing damage to already vulnerable demyelinated axons; because of loss of trophic environment for axons to survive; or as part of a completely independent neurodegenerative process is not clear. Understanding disease mechanisms involved in the axonopathy of MS allows for the development of rational therapies for disease progression.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs.

Disorders of attention often occur in neurodegenerative conditions where they can appear in the context of complex cognitive impairment, or even constitute the central core of the syndrome. This chapter focuses on attention disorders such as the inability to process several visual objects at a time (simultagnosia), the unawareness of an object when presented in competition to another one (extinction), or when occurring on one side of space (visual neglect). Other disorders may affect the general ability to respond to external stimuli and to sustain attention over time. These disorders are described with reference to the corresponding altered brain networks and to the most common diagnostic tests in clinical practice.

An addictive drug that mimics or blocks a neurotransmitter or receptor is like a weight thrown suddenly onto one side (let’s call it the drug side) of a balanced seesaw. The sum of all the adaptations is like a counterweight added slowly to the opposite side (the adapting side) until the level state is reached again. If a drug floods the brain suddenly (a drug spike), an immediate change in brain function results. In the vernacular, if this effect is hedonic (pleasurable), it is called a drug “high;” the drug side of the seesaw drops. If the same drug is trickled slowly into the brain instead of spiking, adaptations can occur even while the drug level is increasing; the “high” is muted or nearly absent, while a plateau drug level is established.",

A wide variety of neurological complications are characteristic features of Sjogren's syndrome, of which peripheral neuropathy is a major neurological manifestation. Based on the predominant neuropathic symptoms, patients can be considered to have several forms of neuropathies, including sensory ataxic neuropathy, painful sensory neuropathy without sensory ataxia, multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy. Acute or subacute onset is observed more frequently in multiple mononeuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, whereas disease progression is usually chronic in other forms of neuropathies. Sensory symptoms without substantial motor involvement are observed predominantly in sensory ataxic, painful sensory, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies. In contrast, motor impairment is apparent in multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy. Autonomic symptoms such as abnormal pupils and orthostatic hypotension are particularly noted in patients with sensory ataxic, painful, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies. Sural nerve biopsy specimens reveal predominantly large fiber loss in sensory ataxic neuropathy and predominantly small fiber loss in painful sensory neuropathy. Vasculitis is observed most frequently in multiple mononeuropathy. The autopsy findings of patients with sensory ataxic and painful neuropathies demonstrate neuronal loss in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia with CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Differential therapeutic responses to corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin can be seen among the various neuropathic forms. In conclusion, the clinicopathological features of neuropathies associated with Sjogren's syndrome are highly variable. The neuropathy classification is important from a therapeutic point of view.",

Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

It is an attempt that often proves difficulty by lack of access to specific investigations and the lack of neuroophthalmology specialists. In most cases, the sudden decrease of vision occurs in the stroke of the eye by occlusion of central retinal artery or one of its branch, occlusion of vein, occlusion of optic nerve vessels or by demyelinating processes of the optic nerve. Rapid diagnosis of eye disease by appropriate clinical or paraclinical investigations, leads to prompt treatment with decreased risk of complications, but in many cases it requires preventive measures.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

The aggressiveness of the treatment for NCSE depends on its neurological prognosis. Aphasic status epilepticus (ASE) is a subtype of focal NCSE without consciousness impairment. The impact of ASE on neurological prognosis is poorly documented. We describe a case of postoperative ASE resulting in verbal and memory deficits.A 54-year-old, right-handed man with focal impaired awareness seizures underwent partial resection for a left temporal lobe tumor. No neurological deficits were observed immediately after surgery. Three days later, however, a focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FBTCS) occurred, followed by aphasia. Electroencephalography revealed 1.5 Hz left-sided periodic discharges. He was diagnosed with ASE. Multiple anti-seizure drugs were ineffective for the resolution of the patient's verbal disturbance. Nine days after the FBTCS, deep sedation with intravenous anesthetics was performed and the ASE stopped. Thereafter, his symptoms gradually improved. However, the prolonged ASE resulted in verbal and memory deficits. Automated hippocampal volumetry revealed an approximate decrease of 20% on the diseased side on magnetic resonance imaging 3 months after surgery.Prolonged ASE can induce verbal and memory deficits. Early intervention with intravenous anesthetics is required to obtain a favorable neurological prognosis.",

Approximately 65% of patients with cerebral palsy have the spastic type.2 The term does not imply a specific cause. Prematurity, anoxia, infection, trauma, and metabolic or other pathologic processes may be responsible in individual patients.",

A 19‐year‐old male is reported who was assaulted and placed in a head‐down position in the back of a car were he was later found dead. Brush abrasions indicated that he had been dragged to the vehicle. The head and right shoulder were wedged into the foot well with the body uppermost. At autopsy, there was marked congestion of the face, neck, and upper chest with conjunctival ecchymoses, bruising of the face and scalp, focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, minor cerebral contusion, and diffuse cerebral swelling with early hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ). Toxicology was negative. Death was attributed to HIE resulting from the unusual positioning of the body. Cases of positional asphyxia involving others may not always include restraint, and when encountered should initiate a careful evaluation of the possible events and lethal pathophysiological processes.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mild head trauma (MHT) is defined as loss of consciousness of less than 30 minutes, GCS&gt; 13, post-traumatic amnesia duration of less than 24 hours. The aim of our study is to analyze all the neurological and psychological consequences of MHT Methods: We carried out a prospective study on 40 cases of mild head trauma in the neurosurgical diagnostic center of Ibn Rochd Hospital Casablanca over a period of 4 months. Results: The average age was 30 years, with 70% male predominance. At the time of the accident, more than 50% were in professional activity. Road accidents represent 78% of the causes. Hemorrhagic contusion was found in 35% of cases, epidural hematoma in 27%, and only 20% without any radiological abnormalities. The neuropsychiatric sequelae most frequently found are irritability in 92%, followed by headache and restlessness in 90% of cases, rapid mood changes in 87.5%, rapid fatigue, intolerance to noise and light, dizziness as well as memory disorders and sleep disorders are frequent. Patients with hemorrhagic contusions have heavier sequelae, a close relationship was observed between the sequelae of MHT and the disappearance of friendly relations in more than 50% of our patients, as well as the job loss. In 45% of patients, with a marked decline in leisure activities and sports practice. Conclusion: MHT is a frequent pathology, with a good evolution but sometimes heavy and underestimated neuropsychiatric sequelae. The legal implications are important and lack specificity and the cost is enormous.",

Motor deficits can result from the damage of pure motor, sensory, or cognitive systems, or from combinations of the three. While sensory deficits can be partially compensated by learning specific strategies to use the remaining senses, motor deficits due to lesion of the motor output areas and from cognitive functions linked to action planning or to space representation have strong debilitating consequences. As examples of these conditions, in this chapter we will discuss the methods used to rehabilitate some intrinsic or extrinsic motor disorders such as hemiplegia, apraxia, and those disorders resulting from misrepresentation of space.",

      "abstract": "The hippocampus (named after its resemblance to the seahorse, from the Greek ἱππόκαμπος, \"seahorse\" from ἵππος hippos, \"horse\" and κάμπος kampos, \"sea monster\") is a major component of the brains of humans and other vertebrates.Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain.It belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory and spatial memory that enables navigation.The hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex; (allocortical) [1][2][3] and in primates it is located in the medial temporal lobe, underneath the cortical surface.It contains two main interlocking parts: the hippocampus proper (also called Ammon's horn) [4] and the dentate gyrus.In Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms.Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy.People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia (the inability to form and retain new memories).In rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation.Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampus respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment.Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.",

This chapter examines some of these conditions; the similarities and differences between them and dementia, and discusses implications for treatment. Certain chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension are associated with mildly impaired cognitive functioning. Delerium may be mistaken for dementia in older people. Parkinson's disease occurs as a result of cell loss in the basal ganglia, an area in the underlying structure of the brain. A cerebrovascular accident or stroke occurs as a result of an infarction in the blood vessels to and within the brain, or a haemorrhage in the brain. Although head injuries affect larger numbers of younger people, falls and related head injuries are more common in older people. The onset of dementia is often accompanied by depression and anxiety. Depression is the most common emotional problem affecting older people, and is often undiagnosed.",

Various functions are impaired in depression due to the deregulated secretion of brain neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors. Moreover, it leads to immune system dysfunction and structural brain alterations. Therefore, administering proper and effective treatment for depression requires comprehensive knowledge of its underlying causes.

Many types of seizures, conventionally regarded as resulting from an imbalance in neuronal excitatory and inhibitory interactions, are recognized. Seizures are broadly characterized on the basis of their origins: generalized or partial. Partial seizures are broadly classified as simple or complex and are characterized by asymmetrical clinical signs. Complex partial seizures include temporal and frontal lobe epilepsies, as well as those historically described as psychomotor seizures. CNS function is derived by the action of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Neurons implicated in epilepsy typically are arranged in layers in the cerebral cortex, receiving their initiating impulses from neurons located in the thalamic cortex. Interference with these mechanisms results in disruption of the postdepolarization hyperpolarization phase, resulting in repetitive neuronal depolarization.",

Neurodegenerative autonomic disorders arise from degeneration of autonomic structures either in the central or peripheral nervous systems (e.g. multiple system atrophy, autonomic neuropathy). Syndromic or \"benign\" autonomic disorders are not associated with any known neurodegeneration, but still cause autonomic symptoms (e.g. neurocardiogenic syncope or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)). This chapter addresses the signs and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction and reviews diagnostic evaluation and treatment.",

The majority of sleep-related movement disorders is represented by benign conditions which have no known adverse effects on health. Many of these disorders include muscular jerking of the torso or legs. Some disorders consist of repetitive movement of the legs. The severity of each of these disorders varies greatly and, in severe forms, the sleep-related movement disorders can result in sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, similar movements can arise from disease of muscle, nerve, spinal cord or even brain, so if movement is frequent or severe, it is best to consult a health care professional.",

Cerebral palsy that is the most common motor delay, is a nonspecific, descriptive term pertaining to disordered motor function that is evident in early infancy and is characterized by changes in muscle tone, muscle weakness, involuntary movements, ataxia, or a combination of these abnormalities. A wide range of causative disorders and risk factors have been identified for cerebral palsy, and broadly classified into 5 groups; perinatal brain injury, brain injury related to prematurity, developmental abnormalities, prenatal risk factors, and postnatal brain injury. Delay in attaining developmental milestones is the most distinctive presenting complaint in children with cerebral palsy. A detailed history and thorough physical and neurologic examinations are crucial in the diagnostic process. The clinician should be cautious about diagnostic pronouncement unless the findings are unequivocal. Several serial examinations and history review are necessary. All children with cerebral palsy should undergo a neuroimaging study, preferably MRI, because an abnormality is documented on head MRI(89%) and CT(77%). The high incidence rates for mental retardation, epilepsy, ophthalmologic defects, speech and language disorders and hearing impairment make it imperative that all children with cerebral palsy be screened for mental retardation, ophthalmologic and hearing impairments, and speech and language disorders; nutrition, growth, and swallowing also should be closely monitored",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury usually results in conditions that affect motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. In addition to the injuries associated with the musculoskeletal system, these primarily affect the mobility of the patient in the early stages of rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, improvements of motor and sensory deficits are important to maintain independence in activities of daily living such as ambulation. Improvements can be attributed to recovery of neuronal structure and function and the adoption of compensatory strategies. The ability to walk again is often the ultimate goal of rehabilitation for patients with spinal cord injuries. Ambulation in patients with spinal cord injury is influenced by the level of injury and the different levels of muscle paralysis, sensory impairment, the lack of trunk control, and spasticity. Depending on the level and completeness of the spinal cord injury, the motor function available is the main determinant of waking ability. Several other factors, including muscle tone, proprioception, endurance, age, range of motion, and additional impairments or comorbidities, are also important in determining options available for walking after spinal cord injury. All spinal cord injury patients can be candidates for gait and gait training, but gait training and gait cannot replace important rehabilitation exercises such as mobilities, bed training, exercise training for daily living, or wheelchair use training.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

      "title": "Spreading Depolarizations Occur in Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries and Are Associated with Postinjury Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Millions of people suffer mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) every year, and there is growing evidence that repeated injuries can result in long-term pathology. The acute symptoms of these injuries may or may not include the loss of consciousness but do include disorientation, confusion, and/or the inability to concentrate. Most of these acute symptoms spontaneously resolve within a few hours or days. However, the underlying physiological and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are known to occur in rodents and humans following moderate and severe TBIs, and SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in more mild injuries. Using a closed skull impact model, we investigated the presence of SDs immediately following a mTBI. Animals remained motionless for multiple minutes following an impact and once recovered had fewer episodes of movement. We recorded the defining electrophysiological properties of SDs, including the large extracellular field potential shifts and suppression of high-frequency cortical activity. Impact-induced SDs were also associated with a propagating wave of reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). In the wake of the SD, there was a prolonged period of reduced CBF that recovered in approximately 90 min. Similar to SDs in more severe injuries, the impact-induced SDs could be blocked with ketamine. Interestingly, impacts at a slower velocity did not produce the prolonged immobility and did not initiate SDs. Our data suggest that SDs play a significant role in mTBIs and SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs.",

US law equates brain death with cardiopulmonary death, but specific criteria need to be met for diagnosis of brain death or death by neurologic criteria (DBNC). There are established prerequisite criteria to consider a patient for brain death that include: (1) a cause of CNS catastrophe deemed irreversible; (2) no confounding metabolic abnormality; (3) no drug intoxication or CNS depressants; (4) a normothermic state; and (5) a normotensive state. If these criteria are met, then the patient can be formally considered for DBNC.",

Neuro-ophthalmologists frequently encounter these patients in clinical practice.A literature review was completed in PubMed using the following terms paired with \"migraine\" and \"headache:\" dry eye, eye pain, monocular diplopia, binocular diplopia, photophobia, visual field defect, tunnel vision, floaters, amaurosis fugax, transient visual obscuration, autonomic symptoms, anisocoria, visual snow, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, and palinopsia.Patients with migraine experience a wide range of visual disturbances including aura and more complex perceptual abnormalities such as Alice in Wonderland syndrome and visual snow. Visual disturbances may consist of positive and/or negative phenomena and may be binocular or monocular. Migraine and other primary headache disorders can be associated with photophobia, eye pain, dry eye, autonomic features, and anisocoria.Patients with primary headache disorders may experience a wide range of visual and ophthalmic symptoms. An understanding of the typical features of these disorders allows providers to help patients find appropriate treatment without unnecessary testing and to recognize when atypical presentations require additional evaluation.",

Signs of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron damage, which are not explained by any other disease process, and are the reasons behind ALS. It attacks the neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These neurons transmit messages from brain and spinal cord to the voluntary muscles. At first, it causes mild muscle problems. Some people show symptoms like difficulty in walking, running, writing and speech. Eventually, the patient may lose the strength and cannot move. Due to the depletion of neuronal transmission to muscles in the chest, the patient may report difficulty to breath. The loss of lower motor neurons leads to flaccid paralysis, decreased muscle tone, decreased reflexes, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy. The defining feature of ALS is the death of both upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex of the brain, the brain stem, and the spinal cord. There are small eosinophilic, hyaline intra-cytoplasmic inclusions that stain positive for cystatin and transferring and are present in 70–100% of cases. Environmental and lifestyle factors play a major role in the development of ALS, but no conclusive evidence is available to support making specific changes to decrease the risk of the disease, Genetic mutations can lead to inherited ALS, which appears nearly identical to the non-inherited form. Patients with ALS generally have higher levels of glutamate in the brain, around the nerve cells in their spinal fluid. ALS patients may experience pain involving more than one type, no rigid treatment program that involves the sole use of a single agent should be employed to treat ALS-associated pain conditions. Opioids have proven to be effective in providing pain relief in advanced disease. Nevertheless, these therapies lack the ability to induce long-term lasting effects without constant administration. Over the last decade awareness of ALS has significantly increased, diagnosis is being achieved in a more timely fashion, and overall care is better. This review gives a comprehensive information about the symptoms, pathophysiology common causes, drugs currently used in the treatment.",

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide management, in particular, treatment options, any genetic implications, and prognosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the family prototype and is a diffuse neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron cell death, causing progressive paralysis of limb, bulbar (speech and swallowing) and respiratory muscles, and resulting in death from respiratory failure. The cardinal clinical feature of combined upper and lower motor neuron signs in various body regions (bulbar, arms, trunk, legs) forms the basis for diagnostic criteria. There is no cure and the disease progresses relentlessly, with few patients surviving beyond 5 years from symptom onset.",

Chronic pain “associated with lesions of the CNS” is termed central pain syndrome (Merskey, 1986; Bonica, 1991). There are many situations in which there is injury of both the peripheral and central nervous system, particularly with injuries of the conus medullaris.

Symptoms of pain, weakness, paresthesia, or palsy; physical exam findings; electromyography; and nerve conduction studies are used to make the diagnosis. Most conditions respond well to conservative measures, such as rest from the offending exercise and correction of poor technique, but surgery may be required for complete clinical resolution in severe cases.",

Fictional movies have misrepresented ECT to suggest brain damage and to ridicule mental illness and psychiatric patients. “Brain damage” has become a colloquial expression without consistent meaning. In contrast, brain injury is the medical term for destruction of brain cells, such as from kinetic impact (concussion), hypoxia, or infection. Studies of both high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and enzyme assays find that causes of brain injury are accompanied by observable structural changes on MRI and elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of brain enzymes that leak from injured brain cells. Concussion is also followed by intracerebral bleeding, progressive brain atrophy, diffuse axonal injury, cranial nerve injury, and 2–4 fold increased risk for dementia. In contrast, there is no evidence that ECT produces any of these. Studies of ECT patients find no brain edema, structural change persisting 6 months, or elevated levels of leaked brain enzymes. Statistical comparisons between brain injury and ECT effects indicate no similarity ( P &lt; 0.00000001). Moreover, the kinetic, thermal, and electrical effects of ECT are far below levels that could possibly cause harm. This robust evidence shows that there is no basis to claim that ECT causes brain injury.",

The Facial nerve (FN) is responsible for the motor innervation of the muscles of the face. Some branches of the trigeminal nerve are responsible for the sensory part of the facial muscles and other branches act on the motor part of the chewing muscles. Traumatic Facial Paralysis (TFP) is the one where there was section or traction or compression or ischemia of the FN, in surgery for tumor resection or trauma in general. In this case occurs the nerve’s section in one surgery. Facial Paralysis (FP) can be evaluated subjectively through the House and Brackmann classification scale (HB) [1]. It is considered a chronic FP when it persists for a period longer than 6 months and leaves sequelae, such as synkinesis, contractures and lack of complete innervation of some nerve branches. Some patients who evolve with chronic FP may also evolve with alteration of the occlusal plane. The occlusal plane is the meeting point between the antagonist teeth, plane that is in the final stop of the masticatory cycle. The rehabilitation of this plan is performed according to the needs of each patient, in this case was made through implant prostheses.",

      "abstract": "Lesions of the brain stem can either affect the nuclei or the fascicles of the third, fourth or sixth cranial nerves and thus produce ocular motor disorders. Lesions of the oculomotor nuclear complex differ from lesions of the third nerve, since the motoneurones in the nucleus are specifically grouped. Similarly, a lesion of the sixth nerve nucleus results in a conjugate gaze palsy and not in an abducens palsy, because of 'interneurones' being intermingled with the abducens motoneurons. Isolated lesions of a nerve fascicle, which is the part of the cranial nerve running through the brain stem, usually cannot be distinguished clinically from lesions of the nerve outside the brain stem unless other brain stem signs are present. In the case of an isolated ocular motor nerve palsy, modern imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, may help to localize the lesion to the brain stem. Most often, however, brain stem lesions also involve structures surrounding the ocular motor nuclei or fascicles, sometimes leading to characteristic eponymic syndromes. In congenital eye movement disorders the pathoanatomical situation is more complex. Since the lesion takes place during intrauterine or early postnatal development, corrective misdirection of neurones occurs in addition to aplasia or hypoplasia of parts of the cranial nerves. Correspondingly, abnormal movements accompanying an attempted eye movement can be observed in some characteristic syndromes.",

The neurological complications secondary to bacterial meningitis contribute to the high mortality rate and to disability among the survivors. Cerebrovascular complications, including infarction and hemorrhage, are common. Inflammation and increased pressure in the subarachnoid space result in cranial neuropathy. Seizures occur in either the acute or delayed phase after the infection and require early detection and treatment. Spreading of infection to other intracranial structures, including the subdural space, brain parenchyma, and ventricles, increases morbidity and mortality in survivors. Infection can also spread to the spinal canal causing spinal cord abscess, epidural abscess, polyradiculitis, and spinal cord infarction secondary to vasculitis of the spinal artery. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction is also an uncommon complication after bacterial meningitis. Damage to cerebral structures contributes to cognitive and neuropsychiatric problems.  Being aware of these complications leads to early detection and treatment and improves mortality and outcomes in patients with bacterial meningitis.",

Imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly of the dopaminergic system, accounting for the often dramatic clinical features, has been uncovered and is successfully repressed by dopamine antagonists [5, 26].

Imbalance is caused by profound neuronal dysfunction due to neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative dysregulation and is also detectable in less spectacular and therefore initially often ignored symptoms [36, 38]. In fact, a remarkable worsening of cognitive/mental performance can be observed during early episodes of the psychosis [20, 36], supporting the concept of a major neuronal damage occurring at that time.",

      "title": "Neurostimulateur hautement intégré et nouvelle stratégie de stimulation pour améliorer la miction chez les paraplégiques",
      "abstract": "RESUME Une lesion de la moelle epiniere est un probleme devastateur medicalement et socialement. Pour la population des Etats-Unis seulement, il y a pres de 10 000 nouveaux cas chaque annee. A cause des nombreux types de lesions possibles, divers degres de dysfonctionnement du bas appareil urinaire peuvent en decouler. Une lesion est dite complete lors d’une perte totale des fonctions sensorielles et motrices volontaires en dessous du niveau de la lesion. Une lesion incomplete implique que certaines activites sensorielles et/ou motrices soient encore presentes. Si la lesion se produit au dessus du cone medullaire, la vessie developpera une hyperreflexie qui se manifeste par des contractions reflexes non-inhibees. Ces contractions peuvent etre accompagnees d’une augmentation de l’activite du sphincter externe. Par consequent, cela mene a un etat d’obstruction fonctionnelle de la vessie, qui induit une forte pression intravesicale a chacune des contractions reflexes et qui peut potentiellement endommager le haut appareil urinaire. Dans ce contexte, la neurostimulation est l'une des techniques les plus prometteuses pour la rehabilitation de la vessie chez les patients ayant subi une lesion de la moelle epiniere. Le seul neurostimulateur implantable commercialise, ciblant l'amelioration de la miction et ayant obtenu des resultats satisfaisants, necessite une rhizotomie (section de certains nerfs) afin de reduire la dyssynergie entre la vessie et le sphincter. Cependant, la rhizotomie est irreversible et peut abolir les reflexes sexuels, de defecation ainsi que les sensations sacrales si encore presents dans le cas de lesions incompletes. Afin d'eviter la rhizotomie, nous proposons une nouvelle strategie de stimulation multi-site appliquee aux racines sacrees, et basee sur le blocage de la conduction des nerfs a l'aide d'une stimulation a haute frequence comme alternative a la rhizotomie. Cette approche permettrait une meilleure miction en augmentant selectivement la contraction de la vessie et en diminuant la dyssynergie. Huit experiences en phase aigue ont etes menees sur des chiens pour verifier la reponse de la vessie et du sphincter uretral externe a la strategie de stimulation proposee. Le blocage a haute-frequence (1 kHz) combine a la stimulation basse-frequence (30 Hz), a augmente la difference de pression intra-vesicale/intra-uretrale moyenne jusqu'a 53 cmH2O et a reduit la pression intra-uretrale moyenne jusqu'a hauteur de 86 % relativement au niveau de reference. Dans l’objectif de tester la strategie de neurostimulation proposee avec des experiences animales en phase chronique, un dispositif de neurostimulation implantable est requis. Un prototype discret implementant cette strategie de stimulation a ete realise en utilisant uniquement des composants discrets disponibles commercialement. Ce prototype est capable de generer des impulsions a une frequence aussi basse que 18 Hz tout en generant simultanement une forme d’onde alternative a une frequence aussi haute que 8.6 kHz, et ce sur de multiples canaux. Lorsque tous les etages de stimulation et leurs differentes sorties sont actives avec des frequences d’impulsions (2 mA, 217 μs) et de sinusoides de 30 Hz et 1 kHz respectivement, la consommation de puissance totale est autour de 4.5 mA (rms). Avec 50 mW de puissance inductive disponible par exemple et 4.5 mA de consommation de courant, le regulateur haute-tension peut etre regle a 10 V permettant ainsi une stimulation de 2 mA avec une impedance nerf-electrode de 4.4 kΩ. Le nombre effectif de sorties activees et le maximum realisable des parametres de stimulation sont limites par l’energie disponible fournie par le lien inductif et l’impedance des interfaces nerf-electrode.\nCependant, une plus grande integration du neurostimulateur devient de plus en plus necessaire a des fins de miniaturisation, de reduction de consommation de puissance, et d’augmentation du nombre de canaux de stimulation. Comme premiere etape vers une integration totale, nous presentons la conception d’un neurostimulateur hautement integre et qui peut etre assemble sur un circuit imprime de 21 mm de diametre. Le prototype est base sur trois circuits integres, dedies et fabriques en technologie CMOS haute-tension, ainsi qu’un FPGA miniature a faible puissance et disponible commercialement. En utilisant une approche basee sur un abaisseur de tension, ou la tension induite est laissee libre jusqu’a 20 V, l’etage d’entree de recuperation de puissance inductive et de donnees est totalement integre.----------ABSTRACT Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition medically and socially. For the population of USA only, the incidence is around 10 000 new cases per year. SCI leads to different degrees of dysfunction of the lower urinary tract due to a large variety of possible lesions. With a complete lesion, there is a complete loss of sensory and motor control below the level of lesion. An incomplete lesion implies that some sensory and/or motor activity is still present. Most patients with suprasacral SCI suffer from detrusor over-activity (DO) and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). DSD leads to high intravesical pressure, high residual urine, urinary tract infection, and deterioration of the upper urinary tract. In this context, neurostimulation is one of the most promising techniques for bladder rehabilitation in SCI patients. The only commercialized implantable neurostimulator aiming for improved micturition and having obtained satisfactory results requires rhizotomy to reduce DSD. However, rhizotomy is irreversible and may abolish sexual and defecation reflexes as well as sacral sensations, if still present in case of incomplete SCI. In order to avoid rhizotomy, we propose a new multisite stimulation strategy applied to sacral roots, and based on nerve conduction blockade using high-frequency stimulation as an alternative to rhizotomy. This approach would allow a better micturition by increasing bladder contraction selectively and decreasing dyssynergia. Eight acute dog experiments were carried out to verify the bladder and the external urethral sphincter responses to the proposed stimulation strategy. High-frequency blockade (1 kHz) combined with low-frequency stimulation (30 Hz) increased the average intravesical-intraurethral pressure difference up to 53 cmH2O and reduced the average intraurethral pressure with respect to baseline by up to 86 %.\nTo test the proposed neurostimulation strategy during chronic animal experiments, an implantable neurostimulateur is required. A discrete prototype implementing the proposed stimulation strategy has been designed using commercially available discrete components. This prototype is capable of generating a low frequency pulse waveform as low as 18 Hz with a simultaneous high frequency alternating waveform as high as 8.6 kHz, and that over different and multiple channels.",

      "title": "Practical approach to the patient with acute neuromuscular weakness",
      "abstract": "Acute neuromuscular paralysis (ANMP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid onset muscle weakness progressing to maximum severity within several days to weeks (less than 4 wk). Bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness may or may not be present. It is a common neurological emergency which requires immediate and careful investigations to determine the etiology because accurate diagnosis has significant impact on therapy and prognosis. Respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness is considered as more critical than lung disease because its development may be insidious or subtle until sudden decompensation leads to life threatening hypoxia. Also, the arterial blood gas finding of severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis may not be apparent until respiratory failure is profound. Hence, the requirement for respiratory assistance should also be intensively and promptly investigated in all patients with neuromuscular disease. The disorder is classified based on the site of defect in motor unit pathway, i.e., anterior horn cells, nerve root, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle. Identification of the cause is primarily based on a good medical history and detailed clinical examination supplemented with neurophysiologic investigations and sometimes few specific laboratory tests. Medical history and neurological examination should be focused on the onset, progression, pattern and severity of muscle weakness as well as cranial nerves testing and tests for autonomic dysfunction. Associated non neurological features like fever, rash or other skin lesions etc. should also be noted. Globally, Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most frequent cause of ANMP and accounts for the majority of cases of respiratory muscles weakness associated with neuromuscular disorders. Newly acquired neuromuscular weakness in intensive care unit patients consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy and drug induced neuromuscular weakness which may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to certain medications like intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents.",

Partial motor seizures may occur. Brain imaging usually discloses gross structural abnormalities in the majority of cases. Metabolic disorders were present in a few cases. The course is with early death or marked psychomotor retardation and intractable seizures with frequent evolution to West syndrome. Antiepileptic drugs remain as first-line treatment.

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

      "abstract": "Epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) encompasses a group of congenital genetic disorders characterized by the association of an epidermal nevus with systemic anomalies including the brain. The most frequent subtype with neurological features is <i>linear sebaceous nevus syndrome</i> (LSNS), followed by keratinocytic nevus syndrome (ENS). Both are caused by postzygotic <i>RAS</i> mutations. All forms of ENS are mosaic disorders that share a common embryological basis and pathogenesis as <i>neurocristopathies</i>. The lines of Blaschko indicate the cutaneous migratory pathways of neural crest. Neural crest defects explain the development of nevi and associated multisystemic anomalies: brain, ocular, osseous, muscular, orodental, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal/urinary, and adipose tissue. Epilepsy and cognitive and motor deficits are caused mainly by hemimegalencephaly (HME), a closely related mosaic anomaly caused by somatic mutations in PI3K–AKT3–mTOR pathway that determines overgrowth. The usual onset of epilepsy is in the neonatal period or early infancy, often as infantile spasms. The pioneer description of nevus sebaceous in 1895 by Jadassohn is the basis for delineating the LSNS. The eponym \"Schimmelpenning syndrome\" as a substitute for that long-established term makes no sense in the context of the large number of authors who contributed to defining this syndrome. A review of 111 cases of LSNS and other subtypes enabled a classification of neurological phenotypes; epilepsy occurred in 77% and HME in 38%. Three distinctive additional syndromes also are within the spectrum of ENS: CLOVES, SCALP, and Heide's syndrome. The impact of epilepsy in patients affected by ENS is related to time of onset and extent of brain anomalies. Timing of the mutation determines the phenotype and severity of the systemic lesions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract 1 D. Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenité ( 1 University La Sapienza (Rome), Italy and University of Utrecht, Netherlands ) Epileptic activity can disturb cognition even when no clinical signs or symptoms are present. These short-lasting discharges of 10 seconds or less are called subclinical EEG-discharges and can occur during sleep or wakefulness. Not only are these discharges an expression of underlying brain dysfunction, but also they have themselves a negative effect on performance of tasks. Since 1939 research has been undertaken to unravel the impact of these subclinical discharges, either isolated and focal or long-lasting and generalised. It is by far easier to determine the direct impact of short lasting epileptiform discharges on cognition when the patient is awake than when asleep and most studies were performed even during evoked epileptiform discharges using hyperventilation or photic stimulation. The more complex the task, the more disturbance can be found. Individual differences are important and interaction between performance of the task and occurrence of epileptiform discharges complicates matters further. Much more recently long-term follow-up studies have been undertaken in patients with rolandic and occipital epilepsy and those with epileptic activity during sleep to determine their cognitive evolution. Mainly transient deficits were found and these appeared to be correlated in time with worsening of the EEG in the active phase Besides scientific purposes, insight into the various factors involved in cognitive impairment in patients with subclinical EEG-discharges is of practical importance.

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

The praxic disorder may affect various body parts such as the eyes, face, trunk, or limbs, and may involve both sides of the body (i.e. ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e. limb-kinetic apraxia), or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of apraxia of gait.",

Typically, it is antedated by an infectious illness, most commonly measles, mumps, influenza A or B, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, or hepatitis A or B, or infection with herpes simplex, human herpesvirus 6, varicella, rubella, vaccinia, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, Legionella, Campylobacter, or Streptococci . ADEM can also follow immunizations: rabies, diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis, smallpox, measles, Japanese B encephalitis, and hog.1,2⇓ Characteristic clinical features include sudden onset of multifocal neurologic disturbances such as bilateral optic neuritis, visual field defects, aphasia, motor and sensory deficits, ataxia, movement disorders, and signs of an acute meningoencephalopathy with meningismus, a depressed level of consciousness, focal or generalized seizures, and psychosis. Maximal deficits are reached within several days and remission may be similarly rapid. More often, however, resolution is partial and takes weeks or months. High mortality rates (up to 20%) were frequent in the past, particularly when ADEM followed measles. However, with the introduction of effective vaccination strategies and the decline of measles, death is rare.2 MRI reveals multifocal areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences that commonly enhance synchronously with contrast medium.3,4⇓ Extensive perifocal edema may be seen. White matter involvement predominates but gray matter can also be affected, particularly basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem. Lesions may also be restricted to the brainstem or cerebellum. Tumor-like lesions also occur. CSF usually shows pleocytosis but only rarely intrathecal oligoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G production, which almost invariably ceases as patients improve. Whereas high-dose steroids, plasma exchange, IVIg, immunomodulators, and hypothermia have been tried, no treatment is established.5-9⇓⇓⇓⇓ This textbook view of ADEM is based on a compilation of features extracted from single cases and small …",

      "abstract": "People with epilepsy will benefit from the adoption of the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) for seizure prediction. Epilepsy is a frequent neurological condition of the brain's Central Nervous System that has negative consequences for patients. The human brain has millions of neurons, each of which is responsible for a distinct motor action in the human body. The neurons send out aberrant electrical signals that go throughout the body, causing involuntary movements and seizures. During the seizure, the patient collapses and experiences jerky movements, tongue biting, nausea, and other symptoms. Recurrent seizures are a hallmark of epilepsy patients. EEG (Electroencephalogram) is one of the common procedures to observe the signals produced by brain and helps to examine seizure occurrence in the patients. Seizure has four different stages ictal (during seizure), pre-ictal (before seizure), inter ictal (time interval between two successive seizures) and post ictal (after seizure) (after seizure). The patient will be kept in a safer state if the pre-ictal stage of the patient can be predicted. With the introduction of cutting-edge Neural Network techniques, their various activation functions, and Gradient Boosting, the patient's pre-ictal state can be predicted and diagnosed, allowing proper seizure medication to be administered. The suggested model uses the Neural Network Based Ramp Raise Optimized Algorithm (NNBRROA) with hyper parameter tuning to predict pre-ictal patients with 98 percent accuracy.",

      "title": "Peripheral Nerve Injury and Current Treatment Strategies",
      "abstract": "Neuronal cells are the main fundamental anatomic unit of the system. Nerve injuries are generally divided into three categories as neuropraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis. Neurotmesis is the most severe form. Schwann cells are activated within 24 hours of the injury and the healing cascade continued with the cells, which are stimulated by Schwann cells. And neurotrophic factors like nerve growth factor (NGF) have a crucial role in regeneration and degeneration processes. Additionally, Schwann cells upregulate the expression of some proteins, such as fibronectin, which are crucial for axonal regeneration. All this information about nerve healing sheds light on treatment studies. Iatrogenic nerve injury has an important place in peripheral nerve injury. Causes may be direct surgical damage, wrong intraoperative patient positioning, anaesthesia-related reasons or limb tourniquets. Typical symptoms are motor or sensory deficits such as paraesthesia, weakness, paralysis and pain. Many of the traumatic nerve injuries require surgical repair. Direct nerve repair and autologous nerve grafts are still gold-standard treatment options. Additionally, nerve conduits are very successful to provide an ideal peripheral support for neuronal recovery but are still insufficient. In recent years, research efforts have focused on the neurotrophic factors and cell-based therapies to perform better microenvironment for neuronal healing.",

      "title": "Congenital Cataracts, Facial Dysmorphism, and Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, and neuropathy (CCFDN) is characterized by abnormalities of the eye (bilateral congenital cataracts, microcornea, microphthalmia, micropupils); mildly dysmorphic facial features apparent in late childhood; and a hypo/demyelinating, symmetric, distal peripheral neuropathy. The neuropathy is predominantly motor at the onset and results in delays in early motor development, progressing to severe disability by the third decade. Secondary scoliosis and foot deformities are common. Sensory neuropathy develops after age ten years. Most affected individuals have a mild non-progressive intellectual deficit and cerebellar involvement including ataxia, nystagmus, intention tremor, and dysmetria. All have short stature and subnormal weight. Adults have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Parainfectious rhabdomyolysis (profound muscle weakness, myoglobinuria, and excessively elevated serum concentration of creatine kinase usually following a viral infection) is a potentially life-threatening complication. To date all affected individuals and carriers identified have been from the Roma/Gypsy population. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CCFDN is based on clinical findings. CTDP1 is the only gene in which pathogenic variants are known to cause CCFDN. Targeted analysis identifies the pathogenic variant IVS6+389C>T in intron 6, the CTDP1 founder variant in the Roma/Gypsy population. Management Treatment of manifestations: Cataracts are treated surgically; exaggerated inflammatory response and foreign-body reaction to contact lenses and intraocular lenses warrant close postoperative follow up. Peripheral neuropathy is managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Secondary spine and foot deformities may require surgical intervention. Hormone replacement therapy for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may help prevent osteoporosis. Prevention of secondary complications: Close monitoring during and after anesthesia for potentially life-threatening complications (pulmonary edema, inspiratory stridor, malignant hyperthermia, and epileptic seizures). Awareness of rhabdomyolysis as a potential complication following viral infections in order to seek medical attention with the first recognizable symptoms and to provide oral corticosteroid treatment (for 2-3 weeks for optimal recovery). Surveillance: Annual examinations for possible ophthalmologic, neurologic, and endocrine manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling CCFDN is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "title": "Erythropoietin enhanced recovery after peripheral nerve injury",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injuries are common disorders affecting the US population and represent a great economic and social burden. Acute injuries to peripheral nerves are most often due to an acute trauma or iatrogenic injury, with the resultant neurological deficit dependent on the injury type and severity. Clinical manifestations include a variable degree of motor and/or sensory deficits, with complete loss of motor function and intractable neuropathic pain seen in severe injuries. Current treatment strategies are limited and are lacking in their ability to improve outcomes. Surgical intervention is reserved for the most severe nerve injuries, leaving the mild to moderate injuries as the most challenging to treat clinically due to the lack of effective therapeutic options. In some cases, return of functional ability may occur spontaneously over time. Conversely, neurologic deficits may persist long-term with an incomplete restoration of function; complete recovery, if it occurs at all, can take months or even years. Even with surgical intervention, outcomes are variable and return to normal function is achieved in less than 50% of patients (Pfister et al., 2011). Erythropoietin (EPO) as neuroprotective agent in the peripheral nervous system (PNS): EPO has typically been associated with hematopoietic properties, but recent studies have found that it is much more ubiquitous with widespread effects throughout the body. Notably, EPO has shown therapeutic benefits in a variety of disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems (Sargin et al., 2010). Systemic EPO therapy has been shown to improve behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological outcomes in animal models of neuropathic pain (Campana et al., 2003), and diabetic neuropathy (Bianchi et al., 2004). The findings from these studies demonstrate EPO's ability to ameliorate the deleterious effects associated with peripheral nerve damage and dysfunction, which may be therapeutically exploited for clinical use in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies. There are many questions and unknowns surrounding the mechanisms of EPO-mediated neuroprotection, and the events at the cellular and molecular levels remain poorly understood. In their description of a novel \"axonoprotective\" pathway, Keswani et al. (2004) demonstrated that axonal injury stimulates the local Schwann cells to upregulate production of EPO. They also showed that EPO binding to the EPO receptor (EPO-R) was a necessary step to confer EPO's axonoprotective properties. To explain this, they propose that the Schwann cell-derived EPO binds to the EPO-R expressed on the surface of neighboring neurons, initiating a signaling pathway to prevent axonal degeneration of injured neurons. In their model, EPO-R was found to be predominantly expressed by neurons, leading them to conclude that neurons were the major EPO target in the PNS (Keswani et al., 2004). More recently, there has been evidence to support the presence of the EPO-R on Schwann cells. Li et al. (2005) discovered EPO-R expression on the surface of Schwann cells, and that injury to adjacent nerves upregulated Schwann cell expression of both EPO-R and EPO. Increased EPO in the local environment promoted Schwann cell recruitment and migration to the site of the lesion. Inoue et al. (2010) confirmed this result in vitro, while also demonstrating that the Schwann cell migration due to EPO occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Direct interaction of EPO with EPO-R on Schwann cells leads to Schwann cell activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Downstream effects that have been observed include Schwann cell dedifferentiation and proliferation, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis via inactivation of pro-apoptotic mediators, suppression of the inflammatory response, and amelioration of oxidative stress in the local microenvironment (Li et al., 2005; Lykissas et al., 2007). These findings suggest, through an autocrine pathway and positive feedback loop, that Schwann cells attempt to mediate the effects of the injury by minimizing the damage to local nerve structures and to direct the process of regeneration and repair of the injured peripheral nerves. While they do not offer any direct mechanistic detail, these studies highlight EPOs significance in neuroprotection. EPO has also been shown to give neuronal tissue anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic properties. In an in vitro study, Csete et al. (2004) demonstrated that not only is EPO administration responsible for decreased neuronal apoptosis, but also that it drives dopaminergic neuroblast proliferation. In EPO-treated cells there were significantly increased levels of dopaminergic neuroblasts compared to untreated cells, after both 24 and 48 hours of growth, showing EPO's neurotrophic potential. EPO therapy following acute peripheral nerve injury: Our lab took an interest in EPO's role following acute peripheral nerve injury. In our introductory investigation, we looked at EPO's therapeutic potential using a validated murine model of peripheral nerve crush (Elfar et al., 2008). In injured mice, administration of EPO accelerated functional recovery and improved histologic appearance in all EPO-treated groups. Interestingly, therapeutic benefit and functional improvement was observed in each of the groups that received EPO therapy, whether treatment was initiated immediately, 24 hours, or 1 week post-injury. These findings highlight that the timing of post-injury EPO administration may be flexible with a wide window of therapeutic efficacy, although the significance of this benefit and its utility in a clinical setting has yet to be elucidated. Importantly, we observed an improvement in the EPO-treated groups greater than that which could be fully explained by axonal regeneration and repair alone, as axonal regrowth occurs at a rate of approximately 1 mm/day. This lead us to posit that EPO may have additional neuromodulatory actions which have not yet been determined, but may be important for the process of nerve regeneration and repair following injury. In our current study, we provide significant data to suggest an additional mechanism by which EPO promotes neuroregeneration and functional recovery in acute nerve injuries - by stimulating and enhancing the myelinating activity of local Schwann cells. This study demonstrates that EPO exerts direct effects on nerve fibers by promoting myelination, that these effects are mediated by interactions between EPO and local Schwann cells, and that exogenous administration of EPO potentiates these effects both in vivo and in vitro (Sundem et al., 2016). First, we reproduced the behavioral results from our original study (Elfar et al., 2008), again finding significant improvement in the functional status of injured mice treated with EPO at both 7 and 14 days following acute crush injury. Histologically, the total axon number in cut nerve specimens was comparably reduced in treated and untreated groups at day 7 post-injury, as expected in this type of injury to peripheral nerves. However, in injured nerves of EPO-treated mice, a greater number of surviving axons were myelinated compared with untreated mice, findings that support EPO-mediated protection and restoration of myelin on spared axons. We then confirmed these findings with our in vitro experiments. When Schwann cells were stressed with an nitric oxide (NO)-rich microenvironment, effectively recreating the pathologic state expected at the site of inflammation in vivo, EPO-treated primary Schwann cell cultures were able to overcome the NO-driven myelin inhibition (Sundem et al., 2016). These results provide evidence that supports EPO having a direct influence on myelin status in the PNS, and validate previous findings of Schwann cells as a primary target of EPO-mediated neuroprotection. Taken together, these findings support the potential therapeutic role of EPO in peripheral nerve injuries with Schwann cells as a therapeutic target. EPO delivery: In the previously mentioned study (Sundem et al., 2016), we reported a novel finding of therapeutic efficacy with local delivery of EPO. EPO has been extensively studied in human populations and is widely used clinically. While it is a relatively safe and well-tolerated drug, there is the possibility of adverse effects with systemic administration, potentially limiting its utility for continuous therapy. Armed with the knowledge of EPO's direct and indirect effects on Schwann cells and neurons, we developed a local drug delivery system and conducted an experiment to compare this novel method of EPO delivery with systemic administration, the standard of care. When EPO (in a fibrin glue matrix) was placed directly on the nerve intraoperatively following the crush injury, functional recovery was enhanced when compared to control-treated mice, mimicking that seen with systemic EPO treatment (Sundem et al., 2016). Additionally, pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated extended release of the drug, release of 90% of the drug over the course of 6 days. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2015) demonstrated EPO's efficacy when injected in a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microsphere. In this delivery method, EPO release was noted for as long as 14 days post-injection. The therapeutic efficacy of this delivery method was supported by their functional, electrophysiological, and histological analysis following acute peripheral nerve injury. Given the drawbacks of systemic EPO administration, the above delivery methods could be viable alternatives and provide a gateway to clinical EPO therapy in peripheral nerve injuries. Limitations and questions remaining: Numerous neuroprotective agents have been tested in large scale human trials. Despite robust theoretical background and promising experimental data from animal studies, none of these trials resulted in unequivocal success; therefore, there is no neuroprotectant currently approved for use in acute injury of peripheral nerves. While EPO's therapeutic potential as a neuroprotective agent is certainly promising, its role in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury in humans remains uncertain. Clinical trials are the next step in the investigation and will allow us to determine if the therapeutic efficacy and benefit observed in animal models translates to beneficial and clinically meaningful effects in humans. Of note, there was a retrospective study published recently which assessed the neurologic impairment in patients with postoperative nerve palsies treated acutely with combined therapy of EPO and tapered oral corticosteroids (Bernstein et al, 2016). Patients who received a combination of EPO and steroids exhibited drastic improvement in their sensory and motor function, with nearly complete resolution of the impairment. Drawbacks of this study include the retrospective nature, unclear significance of synergism from dual therapy, and an inability to determine whether EPO alone would result in the same clinical improvement. While no conclusions may be drawn from the results of this clinical investigation, these findings do add evidence to further support the necessity and utility of conducting randomized controlled human trials. Recombinant human EPO is an FDA-approved drug that is widely used in clinical practice, so EPO's safety profile, adverse effects, tolerability, and contraindications have been well established. A limitation of drug repurposing involves the unknown pharmaceutical data, since these parameters are commonly undefined for a drug when its novel therapeutic application is under investigation. Therefore, the optimal dosage, timing and duration of therapy have yet to be clarified for the therapeutic use in nerve injury. These details will need to be investigated further in carefully designed animal studies and future clinical trials. Conclusions and future directions: In summary, erythropoietin possesses many neuroprotective properties related to its multimodal mechanism of action in acute nerve injury. In our opinion, the efficacy of systemically administered EPO is very promising for therapeutic promotion of nerve regeneration. This route of drug administration has shown therapeutic benefit in animal models and is known to be a well-tolerated therapy for those seeking treatment for anemia. With wide applicability, a well-characterized safety profile, few adverse effects, and prior FDA-approval for use in humans, EPO is a great candidate for therapeutic use and application as a neuroprotective agent in peripheral nerve disorders. Encouragingly, preliminary results already indicate that early administration of EPO can accelerate the functional recovery and improve neurologic outcome in acute peripheral nerve injury. Well-designed human studies and early phase clinical trials are necessary to improve our understanding of its neuroprotective potential and delineate its clinical significance for treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, a local drug delivery system could prove superior to systemic EPO therapy, however further research is needed to design a safe, efficacious, and feasible mechanism as well as to characterize the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of that system.

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

Early identification of fall risk is likely to result in earlier implementation of intervention and to minimise development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. A comprehensive falls risk factor assessment should be performed for older people who present for medical attention after a fall, those who had more than one fall in the preceding year or those who have abnormalities of gait or balance. Falls are as a result of extrinsic risk factors, intrinsic risk factor or a combination of both. Syncope is defined as a transient, self limited loss of consciousness usually leading to a fall. Syncope and falls are often considered two separate entities with different aetiologies. Disorders affecting balance in the elderly are cerebral, cerebellar, spinal cord disorders; dementia; arrhythmias; postural hypotension; cerebrovascular disease; musculoskeletal/orthopaedic disorders; intervertebral disc disorders; psychological factors; visual impairment. Effective interventions include: (1) Health promotion and falls prevention. (2) Single interventions. (3) Medication review. (4) Exercise. (5) Home modifications. (6) To improve safety in the home.

      "abstract": "transient global anemia: transient global anemiaFigureImagine you are crewing a race boat, and in the middle of a gnarly wave, you become cognitively unresponsive but otherwise completely functional. (Cogn Behav Neurol 2017;30[1]:1.) Is this possible? Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a diagnosis that can actually be associated with a person forgetting recent memories and unable to create new ones. Fisher and Adams first described the syndrome in 1964 (Trans Am Neurol Assoc 1958;83:143), and Hodges and Warlow established the following diagnostic criteria (Brain 1990;113[Pt 3]:639): Episode witnessed by an observer Anterograde amnesia during the episode Clouding of consciousness and loss of personal identity without other neurobehavioral deficits No other focal neurologic signs during or after the attack No evidence of seizure Resolution within 24 hours No recent head injury or active seizure disorder Aside from the trouble it may cause for you trying to explain to your spouse where you have been, it's not the worst diagnosis to have—it is self-limiting and there are no permanent sequelae. Interestingly, those reporting TGA have been able to carry on with cognitive and motor activities during the episode without a hitch. They simply become very confused, disoriented, and perseverative, with amnesia to recent events but intact memory for the longer term. The onset is usually fairly rapid, and an episode typically lasts two to eight hours. This is a pretty rare disease, occurring in only two to 10 people per 100,000, and some even loosely compare it with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. TGA is a cerebral reaction to an acute stress episode, while takotsubo is a cardiac reaction to acute stress. (J Neurol Sci 2017;376:196.) We generally function with three types of memory: immediate, short-term, and long-term. Immediate or working memory helps you remember a phone number for the pizza place that was just read to you. This is stored in the superior frontal cortex. Short-term or episodic memory requires hippocampus and parahippocampal area functions in the medial temporal lobe. It will help you remember that you were given that phone number because you are supposed to pick up a pizza with anchovies and artichokes on the way home. Long-term or remote memory will enable you to remember where you live to get that pizza home. This memory function resides in the visual association cortex, temporal cortex, and other cortical areas, depending on the type of memory. Mysterious but Harmless The pathophysiology of TGA has yet to be worked out; theories include venous congestion, arterial ischemia, migraine, or epilepsy. Experimental compression of the brachiocephalic vein has demonstrated retrograde flow in the venous system backing up all the way to the basilar plexus, which is associated with the mesial temporal region that is responsible for short-term memories. (Neurology 2006;66[12]:1873.) This, in addition to the discovery that many patients with TGA have incompetent internal jugular vein valves, supports the venous congestion and ischemia theory of why TGA occurs. But this theory fails because incompetent valves are permanent features, and TGA tends to occur only once per patient with a low rate of recurrence (2-25%). Several pre-attack occurrences have been associated with TGA, including physical exertion, events associated with water, sexual activity, use of marijuana, Viagra, and valsalva maneuvers, but none has been proven to be causal or explain the phenomenon. Other causes of transient amnesia must be ruled out when considering TGA, such as epileptic seizures, transient ischemia of the posterior cerebral artery, migraine headache, benzodiazepine, zolpidem intoxication, and alcoholic blackouts or a dissociative fugue state. Transient epileptic amnesia should also be considered. This rare form of epilepsy is characterized by recurrent transient episodes of isolated memory loss. It is different from partial complex seizures in that it typically has no other neurologic characteristics such as aura or postictal state. The treatment of TGA is simply supportive, monitoring the patients while their memory returns. ECG or EEG may be useful, as are basic labs such as glucose, sodium, and toxins. CT or MRI are typically performed, but have low yield. The most useful therapy is reassuring the patient and family because TGA can be unsettling. The next time somebody wants to convince you that he has lost his memory, don't forget about amnesia. But check the back seat for that pizza.",

      "abstract": "RESUMO: Introducao: Epilepsia e uma desordem cerebral caracterizada pela predisposicao duradoura para ocorrencia de crises epilepticas, as quais sao a expressao clinica de descargas neuronais corticais hipersincronicas. Sem fronteiras raciais, geograficas ou sociais, a epilepsia e uniformemente distribuida em todo o mundo, com predominio na populacao idosa. A caracterizacao clinica das crises e suficiente para o diagnostico, mas este pode ser refinado por exames complementares (eletroencefalograma e neuroimagem). Tais crises podem reproduzir ou bloquear todos os tipos de comportamento motores e nao motores: desde crises convulsivas tonico-clonicas generalizadas, ate piloerecao em antebraco, por exemplo. As manifestacoes atipicas dessas crises foram definidas pela semiologia clinica, quando atenderem aos seguintes criterios: nao estiverem descritas na Classificacao Internacional das Crises Epilepticas e/ou sua semiologia clinica for sugestiva de crise nao epileptica e o eletroencefalograma (EEG) comprovar que se trata de crise epileptica. O amplo espectro clinico dessas crises frequentemente promove um retardo no diagnostico, ocasionando prejuizos ao tratamento e prognostico. Destaca-se a necessidade de reconhecer as crises atipicas, a fim de diminuir o numero de pacientes subdiagnosticados e, portanto, sem o tratamento adequado. Pretende-se, por meio deste estudo, avaliar a prevalencia e a semiologia das crises epilepticas atipicas (CEA) nos pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, com 1244 pacientes atendidos no ambulatorio de epilepsia do Hospital Universitario da Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU-UFAL), entre fevereiro de 2013 e maio de 2019. A presenca de CEA, sua semiologia ictal e sua relacao com o perfil epidemiologico dos pacientes foram analisadas. Foram incluidos os pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia e excluidos 305 pacientes, por apresentarem um diagnostico duvidoso de epilepsia e/ou por terem comprometimento cognitivo suficiente para comprometer a clareza das informacoes prestadas. Resultados e discussao: Foi observada uma prevalencia de 5,79% de pacientes com componente atipico de crises epilepticas, dos quais 1,85% apresentaram crises exclusivamente atipicas. Neste grupo, observou-se a hegemonia do sexo feminino e de pacientes com idade acima de 50 anos, ambos com prevalencia de 60,8%. Alem disso, nos pacientes com CEA, houve um predominio evidente de crises com um componente focal, com sindrome epileptica indeterminada,  exame neurologico normal e com uma frequencia  de mais de uma crise por mes. Conclusao: As crises epilepticas atipicas descritas no trabalho caracterizam-se por manifestacoes escassamente ou nunca descritas na literatura. A nossa proposta de definicao de CEA ajudou a caracterizar esse tipo de crise e a situa-la no contexto das CE em geral. Observamos uma expressiva prevalencia de CEA nos pacientes com epilepsia. Reconhecer essas crises facilita o diagnostico precoce das epilepsias. A partir desse diagnostico, pode-se identificar as causas subjacentes, potencialmente trataveis. Desse modo, sera possivel mudar o prognostico do controle das crises e de suas causas, como tumores cerebrais, encefalites, acidentes vasculares cerebrais, disturbios metabolicos.",

      "abstract": "Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease. It is a fatal and progressive disease that attacks specific nerve cells (motor neurons) in the spinal cord and the brain. Motor neurons control the voluntary movement of muscles. MND is also known as Lou Gehrig´s disease, maladie de Charcot and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).‘Amyotrophic’ refers to the loss of muscle mass; ‘lateral’ refers to the nerve tracks that run down both sides of the spinal cord, where many of the neurons affected by MND are found; ‘sclerosis’ refers to the scar tissue that remains after the nerves damage. Motor neurons reach to the spinal cord from brain and to the muscles throughout the body from spinal cord. When motor neurons are not working, the capacity of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. Patients are often initially prompted to seek medical advice because of a persistent muscle twitch, muscle fatigue, or even muscle wasting. This generally initiates in the hands or lower legs, frequently accompanied by cramps. As MND progresses, patients lose the ability to dress and feed themselves, sit up, walk, or even speak. The bodily functions that remain intact until or near death are the control of urination and bowel movements, sexual function, eye movement, and intellect. Generally, patients survive three to five years after diagnosis. Death generally occurs due to respiratory failure. MND is most common in the age range of 40 to 70 years and about 20 per cent more common in men than in women. The cause of the disease is still unclear. Present treatment of MND is aimed at symptomatic relief, prevention of complications and maintenance of optimal function and optimal quality of life. Researchers have shown that the antibiotic stops “cell suicide” (neuronal apoptosis). Apoptosis includes the activation of nitric oxide and caspase enzyme. The present paper includes the information about the possible treatment of MND by herbal medicines.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) morbidit), and mortality are due to primary and secondary injury. Primary injury is due to mechanical forces during the trauma process and secondary injury is subsequent process following the primary impact. This secondary injury processes involving increased excitatory amino acids, ionic imbalance, decreased ATP level, unusual proteolytic enzyme activity, and oxidative stress which contibute to delayed neuronal dysfunction and neuronal death. The mammalian brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress because of the high oxygen consumption needed for maintaining neuronal ion homoeostasis during the propagation of action potentials. There is a close relationship between degree of oxidative stress and severity of brain insults, which results from a perturbation of calcium homeostasis, energy metabolism, and increased lipid peroxidation.\r\nIn this review we discuss oxidative stress during traumatic brain injury, and it implication on pathology of traumatic brain injury.\r\nKeywords .• Traumatic Brain Injury, Reactive Oxygen Species",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma is caused by an extreme event that occurs unexpectedly and suddenly, is life-threatening or is perceived to be so, and has an intense impact on the senses of the person involved. A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

      "abstract": "Post-operative sleep disturbance, with suppression of rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep followed by a subsequent rebound, seems to be related to the magnitude of trauma and thereby to the surgical stress response. In this context, cortisol, autonomic stimulation, and certain cytokines may lead to abnormal sleep. Furthermore, the environment, pain and the administration of analgesics seem to be important factors in the precipitation of sleep abnormalities. Post-operative sleep disturbance may contribute to the development of episodic hypoxaemia, haemodynamic instability and altered mental status, all of which have an influence on post-operative morbidity and mortality. Prevention or reduction of the post-operative sleep disturbance may be achieved by minimizing surgical trauma, changing the conventional nursing procedures, avoiding opioids and treating pain with non-opioid analgesics, although none of these methods has been thoroughly studied. Post-operative sleep disturbance represents an important research field, since it may have a significant adverse impact on post-operative outcome.",

A satisfactory physiologic and pathologic explanation for the acute or chronic clinical symptoms manifested has not been clearly established. For example, the individual nervous and mental phenomena that so frequently appear as an aftermath to brain injury have been attributed by some to generalized gliosis or to other diffuse tissue change. To the contrary, there are others who believe that such manifestations are to be explained largely on a functional basis. Is the solution of the problem to be sought in histologic studies? Can sufficient alterations be found in the various cellular elements to account for immediate as well as remote symptoms? What alterations take place in these cells, and what is their significance?

      "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic progressive neurodegenerative disease of undetermined cause characterized clinically by combinations of cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and autonomic disorders. 1,2 Many patients with MSA initially develop extrapyramidal symptoms and later experience autonomic disturbance or cerebellar features, or both; others start with autonomic disturbance, and some first manifest cerebellar symptoms and later develop autonomic or extrapyramidal features. Many patients develop only extrapyramidal and autonomic symptoms, but in most of these cases, subsequent neuropathologic studies also demonstrate degenerative changes in the cerebellum and brainstem. 3,4 The term MSA encompasses striatonigral degeneration (SND), the Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), and many cases of sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy (sOPCA). Autopsy examination discloses neuronal loss and gliosis within some or all of the following structures: inferior olives, pons, cerebellum, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, striatum (mainly putamen), and the intermediolateral columns and Onufs nucleus of the spinal cord. 5\n\nRecently there have been descriptions of distinctive neuropathologic features of MSA consisting of oligodendroglial 6–11 and neuronal 12–14 intracytoplasmic and intranuclear argyrophilic inclusions containing accumulations of tubular structures. The glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) are present in all MSA brains, regardless of whether the patients were diagnosed in life as having SND, SDS, or sOPCA-type MSA. 6,14,15 In contrast, GCIs were not initially 6 found in a large number of neurologic controls, including patients with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Machado-Joseph disease.

Acute causes of focal seizures in infancy consist of infection, stroke, bleeding, metabolic derangement, electrolyte imbalance, or mass lesion. Postnatal acquired microcephaly with a reduction of the circumference up to two standard deviations can occur by the first year of life. Infants can also have gut motility disorders and movement disorders including dystonia leading to scoliosis, choreoathetosis, and acute dyskinesia. While seizures decrease in frequency with age, patients rarely become seizure free. During seizure-free periods, patients may advance in developmental milestones but may decline during periods of increased seizure frequency. Infants may have normal to mildly abnormal development at birth but exhibit psychomotor plateau/decline following seizure onset, manifesting as hypotonia, spasticity, intellectual disability, and postnatal acquired microcephaly.",

      "abstract": "Background: The Stroop effect is a simple phenomenon that reveals a lot about the brain processes information. The Stroop effect is our tendency to experience difficulty naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color. It is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The childhood disorder is an any illness, impairment, or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children. Some of the childhood disorders like Mild Mental Retardation, Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders, Eating disorders of infancy or early childhood, Tic disorders. Visual perceptual discrimination is the brainÂ’s ability to accurately perceive information in a complex, fluid and confusing situation and, even more importantly, to accurately differentiate amongst confusable types of information and ability to identify detail seeing Items like differences in shape, color and orientation. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to assess the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders. To evaluate the level of visual perceptual discrimination before and after administration of Stroop task performance among various childhood disorders. To associate the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. Materials and Methods: The research approach used in the study was Quantitative in nature. Pre Â–Experimental One group Pre- test Post test design was used. Purposive Sampling technique was used to select the samples. A total of 30 ChildrenÂ’s with various childhood disorders were selected for this study. Visual Perceptual Discrimination checklist was used to assess the Visual Perceptual Discrimination Problems among children with childhood disorder and administering stroop task performance using Flashcard was used for intervention and Post test was conducted by using same tool in same manner. Results and Conclusion: The result showed that majority of the childhood disorders at selected home 26(86.7%) had low and 4(13.3%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination during Pre test. The Calculated pairedÂ‘tÂ’ value was t= -8.55 and was found to be statistically significant at -P=&lt;0.001 level. After Intervention majority of childhood disorders at selected home 16(53.3%) had low and 14(46.7%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination. There was area of residence and type of childhood disorders had shown statistically significant association between post testlevel of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. The other demographic variable had not shown statistically significant association between the post-test level of visual Perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables .The researcher concluded that by administering Stroop task performance shows that the intervention helps in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination in good range and found to be one of the helpful interventions in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination among children with various childhood disorders. The study had proved that Effectiveness and excellent changes in improvement of visual perceptual discrimination among Children\\s with various childhood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Stress, defined as coping with environmental challenges, involves the activation of the neuronal and neurohormonal systems. Central monoaminergic (noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic) neural networks, limbic structures, the sympathoadrenal system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the immune system are considered the most important stress pathways. Their activation determines stress reactivity and pathological consequences on exposure to situations of distress. Both trauma and long-term stress can cause alterations in the activities of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks within the central nervous system. These neurohormonal changes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disturbance thought to be one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses. PTSD may develop in individuals after exposure to a traumatic event (war, violence, accident) and is manifested by various symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, impaired memory of the event, sleep disorders, nightmares, panic attacks, and depression. In this review the neurohormonal changes associated with experiencing stress are presented to highlight the molecular and hormonal basis of PTSD.",

Medical technological advances have improved central nervous system monitoring in critically ill patients, allowing quick and reliable diagnosis neurologic dysfunction such as delirium, sensory processing deficits, seizures, and encephalopathy to name a few. A number of neurologic evaluation tools are available to assess the neurologic status of critically ill patients both acutely, as well as longterm. Each tool provides unique information regarding neurologic status and has associated strengths and weakness. Identification of neurologic dysfunction allows for the development of working plans for prognostication, therapeutics, and rehabilitation that address the needs of each ICU survivor.

Intracranial pathology is frequently associated with acute autonomic dysfunction which may result in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Several neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), stroke, seizures, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequently observed to be accompanied by electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and myocardial damage. Many other conditions, such as delirium, coma, and loss of consciousness in epilepsy and stroke are important autonomic crises. Clinical signs and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction are often overlooked by physicians or overshadowed by more prominent language, behavioral, motor and sensory findings. The increasing awareness of progressive autonomic dysfunction affecting the course of many human diseases is leading to more accurate and rapid diagnosis and proper management of autonomic failure (AF) (1,2).",

Dentre todos os disturbios do movimento associados a disfuncao dos nucleos da base, a distonia e a menos compreendida em relacao a sua fisiopatologia. Recentestrabalhos revelaram que o circuito motor nucleos da base cortico-estriado-talamocortical apresenta um importante papel nas funcoes cognitivas nao-motoras, particularmente na discriminacao temporal e espacial e na integracao multisensorial. O limiar de discriminacao espacial foi encontrado anormal em pacientes com distonia focal nas maos, distonia cervical e blefaroespasmo. Um fenomeno distinto em distonia e o truque sensorial (ou geste antagonistique). Os truques sensoriais sao geralmentemanobras tateis ou de outra natureza sensorial envolvendo o lado afetado ou nao, que reduzem os movimentos e posturas distonicas. O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001.

      "abstract": "The so-called neurological paraneoplastic syndromes (NPNS) are a group of diseases of the central nervous system of unknown etiology which are seen almost exclusively in patients with cancer. We review the main NPNS paying particular attention to those with ophthalmological and otological features.Certain neuro-ophthalmological findings may constitute, at least partly, some paraneoplastic syndromes. There are alterations of vision in paraneoplastic retinopathy and in optic neuritis of paraneoplastic origin. The latter, unlike the retinopathy, usually coexists with involvement of other structures of the nervous system. Oculomotor function is affected in the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Diplopia and/or ophthalmoplegia may be a predominant or initial symptom, in patients with paraneoplastic neurological degeneration or brainstem encephalitis. In the Lambert-Eaton syndrome and in paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, may have blurred vision and alterations of the pupil. Cases of paraneoplastic uveitis have also been described. Paraneoplastic otological involvement is less frequent. Patients with sensorineural deafness in the context of a paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis have been reported. In the NPNS vertigo is caused by cerebellar or brainstem lesions and not by lesions of peripheral organs. When nystagmus occurs in a NPNS it may be of various types and is due to involvement of structures in the brain stem or cerebellum.The diagnosis of NPNS in patients with no known cancer is important because it may lead to the detection of an occult cancer which is localized or scarcely extended, and therefore is still potentially treatable. Oto-neuro-ophthalmological manifestations may be the first or only symptom of presentation of a paraneoplastic neurological clinical picture.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Rehabilitation Problems in an Adult Patient after Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis: A casereport",
      "abstract": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is a monophasic disorder of unknown pathogenesis, characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system. The possible T-cell immune-mediated inflammatory process, affecting mainly children and young adults, typically follows a recent infection or immunization. Meningeal symptoms are common early in the course and often begin 1-3 weeks after infection. Abnormalities of motor, sensory, gait, visual, and cognitive function are variable and depend on the location (cerebral white matter, brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord) of the most severely damaged areas of the nervous system. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is unusual in middle-aged or elderly adults. The mortality rate is high in the patients with severe cerebral damage after measles, rubella, or rabies vaccination. Sequelae include seizures, mental syndrome, muscular weakness, and atrophy. Although near complete recovery (over 90%) in young survivors is the hallmark of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, its long-term effect on elderly patients is still in dispute owing to little experience. We presented here the case of a 49-year-old woman with bilateral congenital hip dislocation and chronic headache, who suddenly developed hoarseness and left-sided weakness. The full-bloom encephalopathic disturbances resulted in unresponsiveness, respiratory failure, and decorticate rigidity in two days. Physical examination revealed cranial nerve palsies, and bilateral positive Babinski sign and Hoffman sign. Her corneal reflexes, cough reflex, and swallowing reflex were all diminished. Oligoclonal bands were not found in her lumbar cerebrospinal fluid, and head computerized tomography (CT) did not show any abnormality. Brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans showed asymmetric areas of demyelinated plaques over the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, thalamus, and brainstem without mass effect. These findings are typical of the encephalitic form of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. However, no obvious prior infections or vaccination were found. Methylprednisolone treatment and active rehabilitation much improved our middle-aged adult patient's clinical picture and functional status. After 1-year follow up, few residual lesions appeared in the brain MRI. The patient could walk independently with a walker, and her respiration, swallowing, and bladder functions returned to normal. Delayed post-encephalitic sequelae did not occur and her basic activities of daily living were totally independent. However, headache, mild dysarthria, and increased muscle tone remained. She was only partly able to perform the instrumental activities of daily living such as shopping because of poor endurance and calculation skill. The clinical features and rehabilitation problems related to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are presented in this paper.",

Such memory disturbances are usually non-specific, involving several stages of memory, and are overshadowed by other clinical features. Much less commonly, relatively selective memory loss occurs and memory disturbance forms the major clinical symptom.

Such disorder is not as clearly indicated in the electroencephalogram as nondestructive, nonlethal, irritative injuries. Certain nonparoxysmal forms of electroencephalographic abnormality, for example, focal slowing, asymmetry, and altered sleep patterns, correlate fairly well with the structural damage and with the specific motor defects of cerebral palsy. The electroencephalogram is a sensitive indicator of less than lethal injury in damaged but surviving neurons, whose function is not abolished but is unstabilized. Such disorder commonly manifests itself in epileptic seizures. Although cerebral dysrhythmia and epilepsy are not the main problems in cerebral palsy, they should not be overlooked. They are related to the motor and intellectual manifestations and they are part of the total problem. Electroencephalography adds another dimension to our view of cerebral palsy.

People can recover and learn to deal with any issues they have in hospitals and rehabilitation care facilities.

All ages can be affected but children, young adults and the elderly are particularly susceptible. A decline in mortality has resulted in many more individuals living with a disability caused by TBI including those affecting vision. This review describes: (1) the major clinical and pathological features of TBI; (2) the visual signs and symptoms associated with the disorder; and (3) discusses the assessment of quality of life and visual rehabilitation of the patient. Defects in primary vision such as visual acuity and visual fields, eye movement including vergence, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements, and in more complex aspects of vision involving visual perception, motion vision (‘akinopsia’), and visuo‐spatial function have all been reported in TBI. Eye movement dysfunction may be an early sign of TBI. Hence, TBI can result in a variety of visual problems, many patients exhibiting multiple visual defects in combination with a decline in overall health.

      "abstract": "Sleep-wake disturbances (SWDs) are among the most prevalent, persistent, and often disregarded sequelae of traumatic brain injury. Identification and treatment of SWDs in patients with traumatic brain injury is important and can complement other efforts to promote maximum functional recovery. SWDs can accentuate other consequences of traumatic brain injury, negatively affect mood, exacerbate pain, heighten irritability, and diminish cognitive abilities and the potential for recovery. The risk for sports injuries increases when athletes are sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation increases risk-taking behaviors, predisposing to injuries. SWDs are an independent risk factor for prolonged recovery after sports-related concussion. SWDs following sports-related concussion have been shown to impede recovery, rehabilitation, and return to preinjury activities.",

[1]2][3][4] In an infant born at term, characteristic cellular layers can be observed in motor, somatosensory, and visual and auditory cortical areas (ibidem).While proliferation and migration are completed in a term infant, synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and myelination continue very intensively. [1]2][3][4] The developmental processes of the brain are complex, and the possibility for their impairment is very high, which is the reason why congenital malformations of the brain are among the most frequent.The brain is very sensitive to any kind of prenatal or postnatal injury, which may result in developmental disorders. [1]2][3][4] Most of the injuries occur during pregnancy, while intrapartal and postnatal brain injuries are not so frequent. [1]2][3][4] Therefore, it is reasonable to make an effort to diagnose fetuses with brain damage, which is a very challenging task prompting the development of fetal neurology.As the development of the brain is a unique and continuing process throughout gestation, and after birth, it is expected that there is also continuity of fetal and neonatal movements, which are important indicators of the developmental processes of the brain.

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

The totality of neuropathology experienced by an infant is a summation over time of all of the above circumstances, which may be singular, intermittent, or continuous, or, most likely, a combination thereof. This article will attempt to shed light on the spectrum of injury seen in the perinatal brain and will comprise lesions encountered in the stillborn, the premature, and the term infant through the presentation of 4 illustrative case studies. These include a term stillbirth with diffuse white matter gliosis and selective neuronal vulnerability (pontosubicular necrosis); a 3-week-old premature infant with periventricular leukomalacia and thalamic/basal ganglionic injury; a premature infant with germinal matrix hemorrhage, complicated by periventricular hemorrhagic infarction; and a term infant with congenital heart disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, and global hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.",

Aetiologies of PNI include crush, traction, ischaemia, and less common mechanisms such as electric shock, radiation, or thermal injury. Stretch-related injuries are the most common type, followed by compression. It usually results in partial or total loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions in the involved segments. PNI to the upper extremity accounts for two-thirds of all patients. The radial nerve is most commonly injured, followed by ulnar and median nerves. Up to 5% of all patients admitted to level 1 trauma centres have a PNI, and most of them are left with significant disability and morbidity. Magnetic resonance neurography has become the main modality of choice of for the preoperative diagnosis of PNI, and is valuable for monitoring the regeneration process after microsurgery.",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Perturbation in the balance of electrolytes can cause both central and peripheral neurological symptoms. Hyponatremia can be the most challenging electrolyte abnormality to correctly diagnose. Regardless of etiology, neurological manifestations are more likely to be present in acute rather than chronic hyponatremia because the rapid decrease in extracellular sodium precipitates intracellular fluid shifts and cellular edema. Calcium stabilizes electrically excitable cell membranes in nerve and muscle tissue and its derangements can have significant neurological sequellae. Like calcium, magnesium has a stabilizing effect on electrically excitable cell membranes. Phosphate homeostasis is closely tied to that of calcium. Hyperphosphatemia can result in symptomatic hypocalcemia and ectopic calcification but it does not generally have neurological manifestations. Phosphate can also be depleted in malnourished patients. Prompt diagnosis and correct management are important to prevent neurological and systemic complications of electrolyte derangements.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a term used to group conditions caused by a disruption in normal brain function secondary to an external source. Traumatic brain injury can range from mild to severe. These patients can be symptomatic with subtle to major physiological changes unapparent upon imaging. Some of the more common symptoms of traumatic brain injury include loss of consciousness, loss of memory before or after the injury, an alteration in mental state at the time of the accident or a focal neurological deficit. Frequent visual symptoms associated with TBI include unexplained vision changes, photosensitivity, and motion hypersensitivity, as well as decreased visual processing speed, which can make this population difficult and timeconsuming to examine. The patient’s symptoms are often dismissed as psychological, secondary to the neurological disorders associated with the injury. This paper discusses modified examination procedures for symptomatic patients with traumatic brain injury. This paper has been written to encourage optometrists to become members of the rehabilitation team so that these patients can receive the comprehensive care necessary for maximal recovery.",

Although the association between specific clinical symptomatology and lesion location is one of the fundamental goals of clinical practice in neurology, this has rarely been the case with psychiatric disorders. Cognitive functions such as visual spatial reasoning, auditory comprehension, speech production, and extent and severity of motor or sensory impairment are all symptoms of stroke which are commonly used by clinicians to localize lesions to particular brain regions. There is, however, no known neuropathology consistently associated with primary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders not associated with a physical illness), and, even among secondary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders associated with a physical illness) the idea that there maybe a focal neuropathology associated with the development of major depression has led to both surprise and skepticism.",

      "title": "Early Markers for Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a term referring to a nonprogressive disease of the brain originating during the antenatal, neonatal, or early postnatal period when brain neuronal connections are still evolving. Secondary effects of spasticity on growth may, however, be progressive. There may be additional disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior. Babies who are neurologically abnormal as newborns are at increased risk of neurologic abnormality in later months and years. Being born preterm (born &lt;37 weeks of gestation) or with a very low birth weight (weighing &lt;1500 g/&lt;32 weeks of gestation) or extreme low birth weight (&lt;1000 g/&lt;28 weeks of gestation) is associated with significant motor impairment. Which specific signs in the neonate are of greatest predictive power, what long-term disability these signs predict, and how well they predict it remain unclear? Physician’s major concern is to identify specific risk factors for severe impairment in early infancy so as to predict the developmental outcome of those children that may manifest later on with neurological deficit especially if they have perinatal insult. Parents on the other hand are also concerned about their growing infants, their development, and neurological outcome. Since cerebral palsy is a permanent disorder, early detection of signs of motor impairment is crucial to assist physicians to give close follow-up of those infants and to reassure parents whose children are normal. It has been shown that intervention may be most efficient when the plasticity of the brain is high, and an early detection of brain impairment is therefore crucial. An earlier follow-up and training program can have a positive effect of the motor development of the child with CP, in particular through prevention of limb contractions, and might make a difference in the child’s ability to handle everyday challenges. In addition, an early detection of CP gives the parents more time for adjustment and preparation. Since clinical manifestations of cerebral palsy do not emerge before a child is at least 6 months, the general movement (GM) is considered the most reliable early markers for monitoring of fetal and infant movement. Abnormal General movements and absence of the so-called fidgety movements at 3-5 months post-term carries a high risk of developing cerebral palsy. Beside a high specificity (82–99%) and sensitivity (95–100%), the assessment of the general movements (GMs) is quick, nonintrusive, and easy to acquire.",

      "title": "Migraine Aura, Transient Ischemic Attacks, Stroke, and Dying of the Brain Share the Same Key Pathophysiological Process in Neurons Driven by Gibbs–Donnan Forces, Namely Spreading Depolarization",
      "abstract": "Neuronal cytotoxic edema is the morphological correlate of the near-complete neuronal battery breakdown called spreading depolarization, or conversely, spreading depolarization is the electrophysiological correlate of the initial, still reversible phase of neuronal cytotoxic edema. Cytotoxic edema and spreading depolarization are thus different modalities of the same process, which represents a metastable universal reference state in the gray matter of the brain close to Gibbs–Donnan equilibrium. Different but merging sections of the spreading-depolarization continuum from short duration waves to intermediate duration waves to terminal waves occur in a plethora of clinical conditions, including migraine aura, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, development of brain death, and the dying process during cardio circulatory arrest. Thus, spreading depolarization represents a prime and simultaneously the most neglected pathophysiological process in acute neurology. Aristides Leão postulated as early as the 1940s that the pathophysiological process in neurons underlying migraine aura is of the same nature as the pathophysiological process in neurons that occurs in response to cerebral circulatory arrest, because he assumed that spreading depolarization occurs in both conditions. With this in mind, it is not surprising that patients with migraine with aura have about a twofold increased risk of stroke, as some spreading depolarizations leading to the patient percept of migraine aura could be caused by cerebral ischemia. However, it is in the nature of spreading depolarization that it can have different etiologies and not all spreading depolarizations arise because of ischemia. Spreading depolarization is observed as a negative direct current (DC) shift and associated with different changes in spontaneous brain activity in the alternating current (AC) band of the electrocorticogram. These are non-spreading depression and spreading activity depression and epileptiform activity. The same spreading depolarization wave may be associated with different activity changes in adjacent brain regions. Here, we review the basal mechanism underlying spreading depolarization and the associated activity changes. Using original recordings in animals and patients, we illustrate that the associated changes in spontaneous activity are by no means trivial, but pose unsolved mechanistic puzzles and require proper scientific analysis.",

These include analgesics, anaesthesia required for surgery, and the development of acute or post-traumatic stress disorder. This is relevant in clinical and medicolegal settings. Repeated assessments of the post-injury state, involving tests for continuing amnesia, risk promoting recall of events suggested by the examiner, or generating confabulations. The PTA syndrome affects the categorical autobiographical memory, and is accompanied by confusion as an essential component; this should be suspected from the initial or early Glasgow Coma Scale score (13–14/15) if not directly recorded by clinical staff. PTA by itself is only one of several indices of severity of TBI. The nature of the head injury, including observers' accounts, clinical and neuroimaging data, the possible role of other external injuries, blood loss, acute stress disorder and the potential for hypoxic brain injury, must be taken into account as well as concomitant alcohol or substance abuse, and systemic shock. A plausible mechanism for a TBI must be demonstrable, and other causes of amnesia excluded.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence-Based Techniques for Early Detection of Chiari Malformation",
      "abstract": "A class of brain irregularities that emanate in the unborn child during pregnancy and continue to progress throughout the full term and thus be exposed immediately or belatedly after birth are referred to as congenital brain malformations. Chiari malformation is a type of congenital brain abnormality. Chiari malformation, also known as Arnold-Chiari malformation, occurs when the cerebellum, a portion of the brain, protrudes through the opening in the rear of the skull and penetrates the spinal column. One newborn out of every 1,000 suffer from this defect. Some congenitally ill children don't exhibit symptoms until their youth, when trauma, aging, or other changes cause symptoms including vomiting, facial muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, and varied degrees of mental impairment. 'Chiari Type I' refers to circumstances where the spinal canal is invaded by brain tissue without the presence of a myelomeningocele or a sac-like protrusion on the middle to lower back. The term 'Chiari Type II' refers to a brain abnormality with a noticeable protrusion caused by spina bifida and is often more severe than the former. The examination will apparently include imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which produces comprehensive images of your child's brain and spinal cord using a magnetic field and radio waves. They have gained popularity recently due to their non-invasive nature and effective soft tissue contrast. Numerous cutting-edge techniques have been suggested to enhance the performance of MRI image processing and analysis since the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI). The last several years have seen a dramatic spike in the popularity of AI. Recently neural networks began outperforming other well-established models on a number of significant benchmarks, which marked the beginning of the current boom. AI-based algorithms have demonstrated ground-breaking performance in a wide range of complex activities, particularly those involving images. They are widely used in academia and industry, with applications in the medical area spanning from image analysis to natural language processing. They frequently perform better than humans. In this chapter, we discuss the history of Chiari malformation as a congenital condition. In addition, we highlight the significant research conducted in recent years for the early diagnosis of Chiari malformation in the brain utilizing AI approaches.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Neuropathic Pain and the Need for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Recent publications have suggested that more than two million adults in the United States suffer from neuropathic pain, but this number seems to be a significant underestimate. The prevalence of neuropathic pain from diabetes and postherpetic neuralgia alone, using the most conservative estimates of incidence, would equal two million Americans. Lesions of the nervous system responsible for pain genesis can occur either in the central or the peripheral nervous system. The most common causes of peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes worldwide are diabetes, HIV infection, cancer-related neuropathy (due to tumour invasion, surgical nerve damage, radiation or chemotherapy-induced nerve damage) and lumbar degenerative disc disease. Other less common, but significant, sources of suffering are postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain and postsurgical nerve trauma. Central neuropathic pain can be caused by stroke (infarct or hemorrhage), multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and syringomyelia. Certain pain syndromes such as trigeminal neuralgia and vulvodynia, although clearly neuropathic and a source of tremendous suffering, are not discussed in the present article due to space constraints. There is an unmet need for the treatment of neuropathic pain as evidenced by reports of pain despite the use of opioids and anticonvulsants, continuing psychological difficulties, lack of access to treatments and patients seeking access to complementary therapy.",

      "abstract": "A diagnosis of epilepsy is made when a person experiences two or more unprovoked seizures, i.e. seizures without an immediate precipitating event such as fever, a blow to the head, active brain infection, or metabolic disturbance. Epileptic seizures result from abnormal electrical discharges which may be confined to a part of the brain or involve the entire cortex. The diagnostic classification system initially developed by the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy (1989) reflects both the manner in which the seizure begins (partial versus generalized) and the effects of the abnormal discharge (see Table 8.1).",

About 14% of epilepsy patients are under 15 years old and 24% are over 64, with 62% being between those ages. There is an increased risk of death due to accidents, suicide and other medical conditions. There are also cases where the death appears to be directly related to epilepsy itself, usually referred to as Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). This information is not always passed from doctor to patient, for various reasons. Epilepsy share is an uncontrolled electrical discharge from nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. This is the part of the brain that integrates higher mental functions, general movement, and the functions of the internal organs in the abdominal cavity, perception, and behavioral reactions. The early warning system will be based on three factors: 1. Detection of abnormal electrical activity of brain. 2. Detection of abnormal breathing (too fast or too slow) that almost always accompanies the onset of an attack. 3. Unusual sensations or movements of parts of body such as muscles relaxation and tightening.",

      "abstract": "Background Clinicians are commonly confronted with the differential diagnosis of altered mental status, impaired cognition and altered level of consciousness in hospitalized patients including those admitted to medical, geriatric, emergency, intensive and post-operative care units. Although delirium is the most common acute neuropsychiatric condition in the acute hospital setting this diagnosis is commonly delayed, made too late or missed altogether. Difficulties and importance of timely diagnosis The causes of delirious states are manifold. Both, direct damage to the brain tissue as well as encephalopathy as a result of other medical diseases, can be the cause of delirium. Depending on the predisposition delirious syndromes can be provoked by minor medical interventions. Clinical presentation is very variable, but remains largely independent of the triggering mechanisms. Purely catatonic, hypoactive, hyperactive and excitatory types as well as mixed forms can be distinguished.Immediate diagnosis of a delirious syndrome and rapid elucidation of its causes are keys for the implementation of curative therapy. There is a need to act fast because delirious phases are associated with significantly longer hospital stay and increased morbidity as a result of long-term cognitive deficits as well as increased mortality. As negative outcome is closely linked to the duration of a delirious episode, early diagnosis and rapid termination of the delirium constitute a significant positive predictor of outcome. In this respect, delirium represents an emergency, with or without concomitant cerebral or extracerebral symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder. In an acute form of REM sleep behavior disorder, there is a more sudden onset of symptoms as a consequence of a toxic or abnormal metabolic state, including alcohol withdrawal, or in association with the use or discontinuation of psychotropic medications.",

Although anesthesia undoubtedly induces unresponsiveness and amnesia, the extent to which it causes unconsciousness is harder to establish. For instance, certain anesthetics act on areas of the brain's cortex near the midline and abolish behavioral responsiveness, but not necessarily consciousness. Unconsciousness is likely to ensue when a complex of brain regions in the posterior parietal area is inactivated. Consciousness vanishes when anesthetics produce functional disconnection in this posterior complex, interrupting cortical communication and causing a loss of integration; or when they lead to bistable, stereotypic responses, causing a loss of information capacity. Thus, anesthetics seem to cause unconsciousness when they block the brain's ability to integrate information.",

If the mandible is struck by sufficient impact force from below, a variable amount of this force is transmitted to the skull and brain, either directly through the temporomandibular joints, or indirectly in a vertical direction through the teeth and mid facial skeleton. Resultant force transmission causes different acceleration effects to the brain. Direct transmission usually causes a predominance of linear acceleration effects, while indirect transmission usually causes a predominance of rotational acceleration effects. Frontal impacts to the maxilla, by comparison, will cause mainly linear acceleration effects. Generally, more force transmission occurs following mandibular impact compared to an equivalent impact to the maxilla, as fracturing occurs at lower force levels in the maxilla resulting in some energy absorption. The sequelae following maxillary and mandibular impacts may cause serious cerebral injuries by acceleration effects (a).",

      "title": "Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus",
      "abstract": "An impairment of eye movements, or nystagmus, is seen in many diseases of the central nervous system, in particular those affecting the brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in those of the vestibular system. The key to diagnosis is a systematic clinical examination of the different types of eye movements, including: eye position, range of eye movements, smooth pursuit, saccades, gaze-holding function and optokinetic nystagmus, as well as testing for the different types of nystagmus (e.g., central fixation nystagmus or peripheral vestibular nystagmus). Depending on the time course of the signs and symptoms, eye movements often indicate a specific underlying cause (e.g., stroke or neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders). A detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of eye movements enables the physician to localize the disturbance to a specific area in the brainstem (midbrain, pons or medulla) or cerebellum (in particular the flocculus). For example, isolated dysfunction of vertical eye movements is due to a midbrain lesion affecting the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, with impaired vertical saccades only, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or the posterior commissure; common causes with an acute onset are an infarction or bleeding in the upper midbrain or in patients with chronic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C). Isolated dysfunction of horizontal saccades is due to a pontine lesion affecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation due, for instance, to brainstem bleeding, glioma or Gaucher disease type 3; an impairment of horizontal and vertical saccades is found in later stages of PSP, NP-C and Gaucher disease type 3. Gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) in all directions indicates a cerebellar dysfunction and can have multiple causes such as drugs, in particular antiepileptics, chronic alcohol abuse, neurodegenerative cerebellar disorders or cerebellar ataxias; purely vertical GEN is due to a midbrain lesion, while purely horizontal GEN is due to a pontomedullary lesion. The pathognomonic clinical sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an impaired adduction while testing horizontal saccades on the side of the lesion in the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fascicule. The most common pathological types of central nystagmus are downbeat nystagmus (DBN) and upbeat nystagmus (UBN). DBN is generally due to cerebellar dysfunction affecting the flocculus bilaterally (e.g., due to a neurodegenerative disease). Treatment options exist for a few disorders: miglustat for NP-C and aminopyridines for DBN and UBN. It is therefore particularly important to identify treatable cases with these conditions.",

Postoperative delirium, especially when hyperactive, may be easily recognised, whereas cognitive dysfunction is subtle and can only be detected using neuropsychological tests. The causes for these two conditions are largely unknown, although they share risk factors, the predominant one being age. Ignorance of the causes for postoperative cognitive dysfunction contributes to the difficulty of conducting interventional studies. Postoperative cognitive disorders are associated with increased mortality and permanent disability. Peri-operative interventions can reduce the rate of delirium in the elderly, but in spite of promising findings in animal experiments, no intervention reduces postoperative cognitive dysfunction in humans.",

Patients with this condition eventually develop mild ataxia and possibly other signs and symptoms such as cognitive impairment and emotional changes. The pathology is not well known but probably affects cerebellar systems. Medications are sometimes effective, and thalamic deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for patients with severe disabling tremor. A variety of tremors are associated parkinsonian syndromes, including rest and action tremors, which may respond to anti-Parkinson medications but also can improve with deep brain stimulation of the thalamus or subthalamic nucleus. Cerebellar dysfunction can also result in a variety of tremors present at rest and with action and intention. A large number of other rare tremors have been poorly characterized, most notably orthostatic tremor and primary writing tremor.",

The outcome was also evaluated in patients hospitalized due to brain concussion. Three months after the injury (the early outcome) 43% of the 86 cases with multifocal contusions on the CT scan were dead. As evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale, all the 57 patients with a focal brain contusion, as well as the 117 cases with brain concussion, made a good recovery or were moderately disabled. The late outcome (1 to 5 years after injury) was evaluated in 78 cases with brain contusion and in 85 cases with brain concussion, and revealed that complaints and impaired adaptive functioning were frequent in both the contusion and concussion group. The occurrence of headache, dizziness and sleep problems did not significantly differ among the various head injury groups. However, focal or multifocal brain contusions on the CT scan increased the frequency of impaired memory, impaired concentration, speech problems, weakness in arms or legs and seizures with loss of consciousness. Cognitive deficits and speech problems were particularly common in patients with a focal contusion in the temporal lobe. The late adaptive and social functioning were most markedly impaired in cases with multifocal bilateral contusions.",

      "title": "Mechanism of Scalp and Skull Injuries, Concussion, Contusion and Laceration",
      "abstract": "EAD injury occurs as a result of the absorption of energy and may be classified as being either direct or indirect. A direct injury occurs when the head comes in contact with another object because of a difference in their velocities. Thus a moving object striking a stationary head or a moving head striking a stationary object will produce a direct injury. An indirect injury to the head is produced when the body is suddenly set in motion or brought to rest and forces are applied to the head indirectly, as in injuries or a fall in which the subject lands on his feet or buttocks. Regardless of whether the injury is direct or indirect, certain physical conditions are imposed on the head as energy is absorbed. These include deformation (change in shape of the skull), and acceleration or deceleration of the head caused by a blow. In the usual head injury in civilian life, deformation and acceleration or deformation and deceleration exist simultaneously or develop in rapid succession. With a direct injury it is possible that the head alone may be involved whereas with an indirect injury there is likelihood of damage not only to the head but to other parts of the body as well. In indirect injuries it is not essential for the head to come in contact with a nonmoving or slower moving object. The sudden acceleration of the head may produce sufficient physical force to result in intracranial damage. The socalled whiplash injuries of the head and neck and injuries of the head in a fall with the lower parts of the body first striking a nonmoving object are examples of indirect forces acting upon the head. Injuries of the craniospinal junction are frequent in head injury. Setting the freely movable head into motion results in stresses on the structures of the neck that fix the head to the body. These stresses are occasionally so severe as to result in ligamentous and muscular injury, fractures of the cervical spine and spinal cord and brain injury. A discussion of head injury must recognize the occurrence of craniocervical damage. It is quite possible that a patient suffering from a minor head injury may have sustained a major injury to the cervical spine.",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

      "abstract": "The two physiologic components of conscious behaviour, namely arousal (vigilance) and content of consciousness (presence of mind), may be affected differently, depending on the type and distribution of the underlying brain disease. Disturbance of arousal primarily affects wakefulness and awareness and leads to obtundation, stupor and coma. States of reduced arousal are caused by bilateral lesions of the so-called ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which is situated in the upper brainstem and the paramedian diencephalon. If, on the other hand, cognitive and mnemic function are degraded, the contents of consciousness are disordered; depending on the extent of the disturbance, confusion, lethargy and, finally, a vegetative state ensues. The chronic vegetative state (coma vigil) describes a condition of total mental loss with preserved vegetative functions and arousal. Degraded cognitive and mnenic functions results from either toxic-metabolic or extensive structural disorders of the cerebral cortex, where the limbic and mesial frontal areas play a dominant role for conscious behaviour. If the function of extensive areas of both hemispheres is suddenly depressed, temporarily reduced arousal also results. In order to differentiate between toxic-metabolic and structural brain diseases, the motor reactions, the ocular and the pupillary reflexes must be examined apart from responsiveness.",

The neuropathy, occurring at the onset of marked eosinophilia or at a time of its worsening, had a painful onset, evolved over 1–4 weeks, and affected both sensory and motor function. Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated both multifocal and generalized nerve involvement, with the former predominating (multiple mononeuropathy). Nerve and muscle biopsies from two patients revealed severe axonal degeneration with neurogenic atrophy of muscle. The eosinophilia decreased dramatically with corticosteroid treatment and the neuropathy gradually improved, but all three patients manifested residual neurologic disability 17–22 months after onset. The neuropathy may be on an ischemic basis or may be related to neurotoxicity of eosinophil products.",

      "title": "Progressive hippocampal and extrahippocampal atrophy in drug resistant epilepsy: review",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review This article reviews recent experimental and clinical evidence for seizure-related progressive brain damage and discusses possible mechanisms of ongoing brain atrophy in epilepsy. Recent findings Experimental data indicate that seizures induce brain plasticity that may result in either damage or protection. Brief seizures or status epilepticus may promote resistance to additional damage but also induce cumulative neuronal loss and increase susceptibility to network synchronization. Some experimental studies indicated that, following the initial damage caused by status epilepticus, further brief seizures may not produce significant continuing neuronal loss and hippocampal atrophy, whereas other studies showed the contrary. There is recent evidence that progressive damage and atrophy may occur after an acute insult but are not directly associated with recurrent seizures. Clinical research data continue to show discrepancies regarding whether ongoing seizures cause progressive atrophy. Some cross-sectional and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies in patients with partial epilepsies have shown progressive hippocampal and extrahippocampal atrophy, the severity of which correlated with the duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, or lifetime seizure number, whereas others have failed to show a clear association. Summary Experimental data indicate that epileptogenesis in developing brain may not require significant neuronal loss, which is in keeping with clinical observations that progressive cognitive and behavioural impairment may occur in patients with no detectable brain atrophy. A better understanding of why, when and how progressive brain atrophy occurs will lead to better clinical management, earlier surgical intervention when necessary and, ultimately, prevention of epileptogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Most patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience relapses characterized by acute or subacute neurological dysfunction lasting days to several weeks followed by a remission with partial or complete resolution of neurological dysfunction. Attacks may occur as part of diverse demyelinating syndromes: clinically isolated syndromes [e.g., isolated optic neuritis (ON), myelitis, or brainstem syndromes], relapsingremitting MS (RRMS) or secondary progressive MS, or one of the atypical demyelinating disease variants (Marburg variant, tumefactive MS, severe monophasic disorders such as complete transverse myelitis and neuromyelitis optica). The goals of acute treatment are reversal of neurological disability sustained from an attack, arrest of rapidly deteriorating neurological dysfunction, and restoration of function. This may be distinguished from the goals of long-term therapies, such as interferon beta and glatiramer acetate, which are not known to alter the course of an individual attack and its sequelae, but rather to reduce the probability of subsequent clinical and subclinical attacks.",

The state of ebriety is a poor incentive to precise neurologic analysis and follow-up. Nevertheless, only such surveillance in acute intoxication can distinguish a specific neurological complication, a complication following a fall or prolonged immobilisation, or rapid decompensation of alcoholic encephalopathy. Among the specific complications, myopathies and strokes are described here because of their rarity compared to the more common epilepsy and withdrawal syndromes. The neurologic semiology of ebriety is reviewed, including recent pathophysiological acquisitions specifying the mechanism of functional disorders in regions susceptible to alcohol such as the cerebellum and the reticular formation.",

Many diseases can affect the spinal cord. Those of particular note include spondylotic myelopathy, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, genetic and vascular disorders, syringomyelia, injury/trauma, motor neuron disease, and cancer—the most common spinal cord tumours are metastasis, astrocytoma, ependymoma, lymphoma. Specific medical and surgical treatments are determined by the particular cause of myelopathy. These may arrest progression, but function that has been lost may not recover fully. Prognosis of acute cord compression is directly related to the time delay between symptom onset and relief of compression. Chronic disability as a consequence of spinal cord disease requires intensive neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Cingulate Cortex Seizures",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epileptic seizures provide a complex contrast to lesions. Destructive lesions typically cause functional deficits. However, the activities of preserved cortical and subcortical areas, released from the influences of the destroyed or impaired tissue, can paradoxically cause focal hyperactivities. Seizures result from excessive synchronous neural discharges that can cause positive (hyperactive such as jerking) or negative (functional impairment such as weakness) changes. Lesions and seizures both provide valuable, but often not straight-forward, insights into brain function. While the correlation between disease and abnormal function is often easily made, the extrapolation from disease to normal function is much more tenuous. Hughling Jackson’s localization of focal motor seizures to primary motor cortex was a remarkable leap for neurology, but his localization of déjà vu, olfactory hallucinations, and dreamy states to the mesial temporal lobe was a larger jump (Jackson, 1931). He recognized in the dreamy states the dual nature of a seizure’s effects on mind. ‘There is not always loss, but there is, I believe, always, at least defect, of consciousness co-existing with over-consciousness (“dreamy state”)’. Just as motor seizures can be excitatory and cause clonic or tonic activity, seizures arising from limbic and associational cortices can cause positive or negative symptoms. When a seizure evokes fear, the paroxysmal occurrence of the emotion without an environmental context is readily identified by the patient.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "title": "Assisting Veterans with mTBI/PTSD",
      "abstract": "Concussion, also called mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a diffuse non-penetrating head injury caused by a sudden external force, such as during contact sports or a blast in combat.1 When a sudden force moves the brain rapidly inside the close confines of the skull, it creates chemical changes, inflammation, stretching and shearing of axons, improper cell function, and cell death. This injury is often not visible on medical imaging, but it disrupts micro-second temporal computations critical for signal decoding and speech processing. Common symptoms of concussion/mTBI include cognitive impairment, attention deficits, difficulty concentrating, headaches, visual problems, anxiety, depression, irritability, and sleep disturbances. Loss of consciousness is not required for the diagnosis of concussion. However, repeated concussive or sub-concussive events, especially with loss of consciousness, can result in greater severity of the symptoms.PTSD, mental health, hearing lossFigure 1: Audiograms of veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD.Table 1: Counseling Strategies for Veterans with mTBI and/or PTSDGenerally, the symptoms resolve within three months. Some individuals, however, may continue to experience symptoms for a year or more.2 About 50 percent of individuals with a single mTBI exposure demonstrate long-term cognitive impairment and other symptoms that can interfere with returning to work or school.3, 4 Concussions, especially from blast injuries, can also damage the auditory system. The human ear is designed to be sensitive to changes in pressure; therefore, it is the organ most susceptible to pressure changes created by a blast wave. Auditory symptoms reported with mTBI or concussion include difficulty understanding speech in quiet and in noise, difficulty attending to sounds or ignoring distracting sounds, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and balance problems.1 Events that cause mTBI may result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric disorder that can occur in people who have difficulty recovering from experiencing/witnessing a traumatic physical or emotional event. The persistent mental and emotional distress can last over a month.5 Individuals who experienced a traumatic event that did not trigger PTSD are at an increased risk for PTSD in the future.6 Many military veterans experience multiple episodes of mTBI, which set them at a higher risk for PTSD. Between 2000 and 2018, roughly 315,897 cases of mTBI, many of which caused by blast-related injury, were confirmed across all branches of the U.S. military.7 About 20 percent of U.S. military veterans are affected by PTSD.5 Veterans with combined mTBI and PTSD show exacerbated symptoms of decreased attention, working memory/memory deficits, executive function deficits, and hypervigilance.8 It is important to raise awareness of common behaviors and test discrepancies observed in veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD so hearing health professionals can better diagnose and counsel these patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Many veterans receive audiologic care outside of the Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC). Our university clinic is under a contractual agreement with different veteran service groups to provide compensation and pension audiologic assessments. A subset of the veterans assessed in our clinic exhibited normal or mild pure-tone thresholds while self-reporting a much more significant hearing loss. These findings were consistent with a recent study that found that among 87 percent of veteran participants with mTBI who reported hearing loss, nearly two-thirds fell within the “normal hearing” range.9 Comorbid hyperacusis with mTBI and PTSD was common in our clinic population, which created practical problems during assessments. In some cases, when assessing acoustic reflex thresholds (ARTs), results were either inaccurate, or the test could not be completed when the louder reflex tones elicited significant physical discomfort and/or anxiety resulting in muscle tension. Clinicians need to be vigilant in recognizing these behaviors because veterans often do not disclose hyperacusis or report any discomfort. Conversely, some veterans appeared to tolerate the ART assessment, but demonstrated sound sensitivity during pure tone evaluation to levels below those used to assess ARTs. Other issues confounding diagnosis were incomplete or unavailable medical history at the time of the appointment and veterans not always reporting combat-related injuries, mTBI, and/or PTSD. CASE STUDIES These three cases exemplify the type of case histories, behaviors, and audiometric test results observed in the veteran population in our clinic. These three veteran patients men between 22 and 55 years old. Audiometric evaluations were performed according to the test procedures required by VAMC and using insert earphones in a sound booth. The veterans’ middle ear status was normal as determined via tympanometry and ARTs. Word recognition scores (WRS) were determined at 40 dB SL re: speech recognition threshold (SRT) in quiet. The Stenger test was performed as needed according to the VAMC protocol. Veteran A reported a history of blast exposure, multiple concussions (>6), with reported loss of consciousness on several occasions. He reported having hearing difficulty, needing closed captioning for TV, and requesting frequent repetitions from communication partners. Figure 1A shows veteran A's audiogram. His WRS were excellent at 92 percent for the right ear and 100 percent for the left. These results were not consistent with Veteran A's subjective hearing loss. He was previously diagnosed with PTSD. Veteran B reported a history of blast exposure and concussion. He reported having constant bilateral tinnitus, as well as difficulty communicating in noise and understanding his wife. He tolerated the ART assessment, but had anxiety and sensory overload during the hearing evaluation, which increased the test administration time. He needed the lights to be dimmed in the sound booth and test suite during the test. He also needed a water break to recuperate. Figure 1B shows his audiogram. The WRS were excellent at 92 percent for the right ear and 96 percent for the left, which were not consistent with Veteran B's subjective hearing loss. He denied having PTSD. Veteran C reported a history of blast injury and head injury from a service-related fall. He reported requiring multiple repetitions of verbal information and missing information because of an inability to notice that he was being spoken to. He demonstrated high anxiety levels during the hearing evaluation. He denied having hyperacusis repeatedly, but became increasingly anxious as the stimulus levels for the ART assessment increased to >90 dB HL. Contralateral acoustic reflex thresholds for the higher frequencies could not be determined because the test had to be discontinued due to patient discomfort. The WRS were good at 84 percent for the right ear and 80 percent for the left. Figure 1C shows Veteran C's audiogram. The WRS were lower than expected based on age and pure tone thresholds. The veteran believed that he had PTSD, but had yet to be diagnosed. COUNSELING VETERANS WITH MTBI/PTSD Simply validating perceptual hearing problems can be significant for some veterans. Emphasizing counseling during and after the audiometric evaluation can provide a gateway to a veteran's whole-person health care and encourage the patient to seek additional services for mTBI and/or PTSD. Unless clinicians ask the appropriate questions, it is easy to overlook mTBI/PTSD as an underlying cause of a veteran's problems. Useful counseling strategies are shown in Table 1. Audiologists need to be aware that the hearing complaints of veterans with mTBI or PTSD may actually be non-auditory behavioral, emotional, and cognitive/attention issues that can confound diagnosis and raise suspicion of non-compliant behaviors or non-organic hearing loss. Comprehensive assessment of the peripheral and central auditory and vestibular systems, including speech-in-noise testing, and tinnitus assessment may be necessary. Guiding veterans’ understanding that hearing goes beyond the peripheral auditory system is important to validating any perceived hearing problem. This will also help them be more responsive to counseling and other intervention services. Thoughts on something you read here? Write to us at [email protected]",

In a retrospective study of 28 children who suffered significant nonaccidental head injury, 57% had a history of apnea prior to hospitalization, 82% were intubated upon admission, and 71% had early seizures. For further evidence of ischemia and hypoxia, the first recorded blood pressure was <80 in 50% and the arterial pH <7.3 in 54%. Seventy-one percent had diffuse brain swelling which is characteristic of cerebral hypoxia and/or ischemia on the first CT scan. None of the children who had clinical evidence of cerebral hypoxia or ischemia had a good outcome. We conclude that trauma-induced apnea causes cerebral hypoxia and/or ischemia which is more fundamental to outcome than the mechanism of injury (shaken vs. shaken with impact), subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, parenchymal shear, or brain contusion.",

Complete loss of consciousness occurs when epileptic activity involves both cortical and subcortical structures, as in generalized seizures. On the other hand, simple partial seizures can spare both the level and contents of consciousness. Finally, complex partial seizures associated with medial temporal lobe discharges can selectively impair the patient's subjective experiences with variable degrees of responsiveness. The differences in ictal semiology between patients with epilepsy offer unique avenues for understanding the relationship between pathological brain function and altered conscious states.",

Storage of the information acquired before the appearance of the symptoms of dementia is unlikely to depend on the degree of its personality importance. Before it becomes strongly manifest, senile dementia does not prevent the stamping on the person's memory, at least of part of new information (possibly, of only emotionally significant). Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia. Difficulties in active reproduction of the ideas available in memory stores can already be seen at the early stages, becoming more remarkable as the disease progresses.",

A number of epidemiologic surveys have established an association between anesthesia in patients younger than 3 to 4 years and subsequent learning disabilities and language disorders whereas others have not found this link. In middle-aged and elderly patients, anesthesia is frequently associated with the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The key component of its pathogenesis (general anesthesia itself or other factors, such as operative injury, an inflammatory response, pain syndrome, intraoperative complications, underlying disease in a patient) remains unelucidated. It is concluded that there is a need for additional experimental and clinical studies of the pathogenesis of these undesirable phenomena to be prevented and corrected.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neuromuscular weakness is common in the setting of critical illness. Over the past two decades, it has been recognized that polyneuropathy or myopathy may develop de novo as a complication of the underlying illness, sepsis, or the medical therapies. This weakness complicates recovery and often contributes to prolonged ventilator dependence. REVIEW SUMMARY The neuromuscular complications of critical illness include critical illness polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, and prolonged pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade. As a complication of critical illness and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (usually produced by sepsis), an axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy may be seen. A myopathy, often called acute quadriplegic myopathy, may develop in a similar setting, often in association with the use of corticosteroids and/or nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs). Weakness in this latter disorder may result from electrical inexcitability of muscle due to altered membrane sodium channels with reduced sodium currents and loss of myosin thick filament. Some patients, particularly those with abnormal renal or hepatic function, may have prolonged weakness for as long as one week after the use of NMBAs. This large, heterogeneous group of patients are difficult to evaluate due to the limitations imposed by the critical care setting and may have critical illness polyneuropathy, acute quadriplegic myopathy, or both. CONCLUSIONS Neuromuscular weakness may occur in association with a combination of risk factors, including sepsis and multiorgan failure (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), high-dose corticosteroids, and NMBAs. This may take the form of an axonal polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, or both.",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role. To conclude, neurological patients require special attention from clinicians in form of openly verbalizing and exploring the suicidal thematic, inquiring about protective and risk factors, and promptly initiating both a psychopharmacological treatment and, where possible, psychological support.",

      "abstract": "The mental changes which accompany disturbances of the viscera may be classified under two groups, as follows:— ( a ) Those changes which accompany the disease directly, and are associated with the presence of some abnormal product or tissue change produced directly by the disease (for example, myxódema). These may be called the direct mental effects of visceral disease, and will be neglected in this communication. ( b ) Certain mental changes which are only present in those cases where the visceral disturbance causes what is known as referred pain associated with tenderness of the superficial structure of the body and scalp. Now this pain and tenderness are due to changes in some part of the central sympathetic system caused by disturbance of the internal organ to which sensory sympathetic nerves are supplied. Thus the mental changes of this group may be said to be indirect, for they are associated with visceral disturbances through the mediation of the sympathetic system. In this communication only the sensory and emotional changes are considered.",

If weakness is out of proportion to atrophy, demyelinating neuropathy should be suspected. Chronic myopathies and immobility also may cause atrophy, but no electromyography (EMG) evidence of denervation or myopathy is found. The pattern of atrophy is often helpful to localize the lesions. Atrophy of the interossi and preservation of the bulk of the thenar muscles suggest ulnar neuropathy, but atrophy of both would suggest a C8 or plexus pathology. Muscle enlargement may be due to fatty replacement, which can be confirmed by EMG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or due to real muscle hypertrophy from excessive discharges (neuromyotonia).",

Abstract A Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may appear after experiencing a stressful situation and is characterized by recalling the trauma, avoiding situations that remind it, and through persistent hyperarousal. Its etiology and symptoms suggest the involvement of various behavioral systems, such as an exaggerated aversive conditioning, difficulty in extinguishing the traumatic memory and behavioral sensitization, which is characterized by an intense response before moderate stressors not related to trauma. Regarding to the neurobiology of the disorder, it is  suggested a reduction in the volume of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, an exaggerated responsiveness of amygdala with alteration of its modulation by ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, sympathetic hyperfunction of the adrenal axis and hypothalamic hypofunction of pituitary-adrenal axis. It is concluded that PTSD is a disorder related to anxiety and memory. Key-Words: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, Anxiety, Memory.

It is characterized principally by the loss of the normal coherent stream of thought or action and may manifest as agitated delirium or somnolence. Examination of a confused patient should focus on assessment of attention. Fluent aphasias, neglect, transient global amnesia, psychosis, and the Charles Bonnet syndrome are important conditions that may be misdiagnosed as confusion. The right hemispheric syndrome is a multimodal disorder of directed attention. Toxic-metabolic disturbances are the most common causes of confusion, and encephalopathies related to alcohol and hepatic dysfunction are particularly characteristic. Meningitis and encephalitis are important causes and can be overlooked if directed evaluation is not performed. Lumbar puncture is an important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of a confused patient and can be performed easily if anatomic landmarks are identified and proper positioning is achieved. Structural lesions of the brain are uncommon causes of confusion. Most disorders that produce confusion are treatable if recognized in a timely fashion.",

      "title": "Mild Cognitive Impairment as the Initial Manifestation of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a major form atypical parkinsonism that should be differentiated from Parkinson's disease. Individuals with PSP typically present with an akinetic rigid syndrome with early postural instability, axial rigidity, and supranuclear gaze palsy.1, 2 Cognitive disorder in PSP is milder than Alzheimer's disease,3 featuring frontal executive dysfunction,4, 5 and appears with motor signs.1, 2 In contrast, it is rare that cognitive disorder occurs without motor disorder in PSP.2, 3 Such a patient was recently seen. A 73-year-old, previously healthy woman began to have memory problems (e.g., forgetful, forgetting to turn lights off, forgetting neighbors’ names) and infrequent delusional episodes (e.g., thinking that someone had stolen her wallet) for which she saw a general physician, who referred her to a memory clinic. She was taking no drugs that might affect cognitive or motor function. She was alert but slightly nervous and irritable. Her speech was fluent, and cranial nerve examinations, including extraocular muscle movement and eyelids, produced normal results. Her posture, including her neck, was normal. She had no tremor, rigidity, or akinesia of the neck, hands, or feet. Her gait was slightly slow for her age. Sensory examinations were unremarkable. She scored 20 out of 30 (normal > 24) on the Mini-Mental state Examination (MMSE) and 8 out of 18 (normal > 16) on the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Laboratory data were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1A) and brain 99mTc- L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography showed no remarkable changes. Metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy results were normal (heart to mediastinum ratio on delayed images 3.35, normal > 2.0).6 Although hippocampal atrophy was not remarkable, she was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due possibly to Alzheimer's disease. She was referred back to the local clinic, where 5 mg/d donepezil hydrochloride was started. Two years later, she was referred to the memory clinic again because of slow, short-stepped gait with assistance that had begun 1 year before. On examination, her cognitive function had deteriorated: MMSE score 14, FAB score 5. Delusions were not significant. Cranial nerve examination showed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and dysarthria. She had no retropulsion. She had rigidity in her neck and upper extremities and marked akinesia bilaterally. She had no signs of aphasia, apraxia, limb dystonia, or alien hands. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum (humming-bird sign or emperor penguin sign)7 (Figure 1B), and she was diagnosed with PSP1, 2 and referred back to the local clinic with instructions that she needed 300 mg/d of levodopa/carbidopa for gait difficulty. At the first visit, she had MCI alone without motor disorder. At the second visit, 2 years later, she had vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity and akinesia. She did not have classical corticobasal syndrome during the course of the disease. Repeated brain MRI revealed midbrain atrophy and neurological signs. No similar cases had been previously reported to the knowledge of the authors except for a schizophrenia-like case8 and two cases of behavioral changes.9, 10 At the first memory screening, The woman described herein had marked frontal executive dysfunction as assessed according to the FAB. Prominent frontal dysfunction is a feature of PSP but not of Alzheimer's disease.3 A pathological lesion might have started in the frontal cortex and caused her frontal executive dysfunction. In conclusion, an elderly woman with PSP who presented with MCI without motor disorder is reported. MCI can be listed as a premotor feature of PSP.

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli.

      "abstract": "Diverse neuromuscular disorders can complicate the course of a severely ill patient. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

      "title": "Physiological mechanisms of neuromuscular impairment in diabetes‐related complications: Can physical exercise help prevent it?",
      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder that progressively induces complications, compromising daily independence. Among these, diabetic neuropathy is particularly prevalent and contributes to substantial neuromuscular impairments in both types 1 and 2 diabetes. This condition leads to structural damage affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in a significant decline in sensorimotor functions. Alongside neuropathy, diabetic myopathy also contributes to muscle impairment and reduced motor performance, intensifying the neuromuscular decline. Diabetic neuropathy typically implicates neurogenic muscle atrophy, motoneuron loss and clustering of muscle fibres as a result of aberrant denervation-reinervation processes. These complications are associated with compromised neuromuscular junctions, where alterations occur in pre-synaptic vesicles, mitochondrial content and post-synaptic signalling. Neural damage is intensified by chronic hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress, exacerbating vascular dysfunction and reducing oxygen delivery. These complications imply a severe decline in neuromuscular performance, evidenced by reductions in maximal force and power output, rate of force development and muscle endurance. Furthermore, diabetes-related complications are compounded by age-related degenerative changes in long-term patients. Aerobic and resistance training offer promising approaches for managing blood glucose levels and neuromuscular function. Aerobic exercise promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, supporting metabolic and cardiovascular health. Resistance training primarily enhances neural plasticity, muscle strength and hypertrophy, which are crucial factors for mitigating sarcopenia and preserving functional independence. This topical review examines current evidence on the physiological mechanisms underlying diabetic neuropathy and the potential impact of physical activity in counteracting this decline.",

Blowout fractures may result in vertical and/or horizontal paralytic restrictive deviations. These may occur from fibrosis of the muscles as well as nerve and/or actual muscle damage. Inadvertent entry into the orbit following otorhinolaryngological surgery has had the same serious consequences. We discuss diagnostic and management techniques to aid in the care of these problems, as well as the problems of decompensation of monofixation syndromes and controlled accommodative esotropias resulting in decompensation by relative inconsequential head traumas.",

      "abstract": "The concept of work-related is controversial in all countries and its design varies depending on the different legal precepts of each one. The objective of this study is to assess the circumstances of a case of a work accident claim resulting in the death of employee suffering from epilepsy and in which, as the result of a crisis, a brain trauma occurs with fatal consequences. Laborer contingency is claimed, but it is denied in the first instance by the Mutual of occupational accidents and diseases. In Spain, the legal definition of an accident at work has been developed by case-law in virtually all the elements that constitute it. It contemplates the concept of gainful employment, damage or injury caused, of physical and mental injury, and it deems as injury or accident not only what results from the sudden and violent action of an external agent on the human body, but also the damage that comes from certain diseases such as internal processes, sudden or slow action, or arising or originating from the job. With common diseases such as epilepsy, the lack of a strict or direct causal link between epilepsy and work does not preclude any legal presumption to the harmful results caused by seizures in the place and time of the job (death or injuries from falls caused by the crisis), as these may have occurred during work.",

He has been in good general health, has had no fever or other symptoms of infectious processes, has been taking no medications, and was \"his normal self\" until immediately prior to being found. Patients who are unresponsive and unarousable are in coma. The term altered consciousness represents the spectrum of abnormalities that exists between the immediate capability for normal wakefulness and true coma. For the purposes of this review, the two terms will be used interchangeably because their causes are similar and usually differ only in severity. Pathophysiology Two areas of the brain are responsible for consciousness: the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and the cerebral cortex. The ARAS is located in the brain stem from the level of the medulla to the level of the midbrain and sends multiple afferent neurons to the cortex. Disruption of this system can lead to disorders of consciousness. The cerebral cortex is the much more common site where dysfunction can cause coma. Any injury or illness that affects the cerebral cortex globally can cause coma or altered consciousness. Differential Diagnosis Altered consciousness in children can be caused by injuries or illnesses that affect the central nervous system directly or can be a manifestation of other systemic disease (Table 1).",

Esta alteración puede tener distintos orígenes: cerebeloso, cuando se ve comprometido el cerebelo; sensitivo, si hay daño en las vías propioceptivas; o vestibular, cuando está involucrado el sistema del equilibrio. Las causas pueden ser hereditarias, como en las ataxias espinocerebelosas, o adquiridas, debido a traumatismos, accidentes cerebrovasculares, infecciones, tumores o consumo crónico de alcohol. El impacto de la ataxia en la calidad de vida es significativo, ya que limita la autonomía del paciente, afecta su movilidad funcional y puede generar dependencia en las actividades básicas de la vida diaria. La fisioterapia adquiere un rol fundamental en el manejo terapéutico de esta condición, posicionándose como un recurso indispensable.

      "abstract": "The long-term prognosis for epileptics vary from an entirely normal life to early death or complete incapacity. Studies to date have not provided clear answers on the long-term sequelae of epilepsy. This is because there are many epileptic syndromes with different outcomes. Most studies include a heterogeneous group of patients who may not be representative of all the epileptics in the community. The prognosis for permanent remission of seizure varies with the seizure type. In childhood epilepsies, overall there is at least 50% chance of permanent remission. The more seizures the patient has had before anticonvulsants were started, the more difficult it is to control the seizures, the poorer the prospects for remission. Other unfavourable signs include partial seizures, multiple seizure types, mental retardation, neurological deficits and underlying brain lesion. The effect of seizures on intellectual development is controversial. Actual regression in children with epilepsy is rare except where the seizures are caused by a progressive pathology. However, in a significant proportion of children, intellectual development slows down after the onset of seizures. This is more likely to occur in children with severe seizures, and those on multiple anticonvulsants and with frequent toxic levels. Children with epilepsy have an increased likelihood of developing behavioural, emotional and psychiatric problems. The underlying neurological dysfunction, anxiety about losing control of oneself at any time, reaction of parents, friends and teachers to the condition and side effects of anticonvulsants all contribute to the psychopathology. In conclusion, the long-term sequelae of epilepsy are multiple and serious. Some of the causal factors are known and preventable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Il notare, a volte, nei bambini affetti da enuresi primitiva la concomitanza di piccoli disturbi psichici o emozionali, di piccolo male, di stati di ipervagotonia o spasmofilia, conferma la natura funzionale complessa dell'affezione, sulla quale influiscono in prevalenza turbe della vita psichica o degli interessi affettivi del bambino. Alcuni dei fattori psichici implicati nell'enuresi (mancinismo, infantilismo nei giochi o discorsi, terrori notturni, fobie) possono anche essere considerati come indice di una incompleta maturazione psichica. Non vogliamo qui discutere sull'etiopatogenesi della malattia, che è tuttora piuttosto oscura. La maggioranza degli autori considera l'enuresi primitiva come un disturbo funzionale complesso, non legato ad alterazioni dell'innervazione o della maturazione delle strutture nervose e muscolari preposte alla funzione vescicale, ma piuttosto riportabile ad alterazioni (o ritardo) del meccanismo volontario della minzione. Si parla di enuresi primitiva quando il controllo anche notturno della minzione non è stato raggiunto entro i primi tre anni di vita. Secondo Harrison (1967), a 5 anni l'enuresi è presente nel 15% dei maschi e nel 10% delle femmine, a 9 anni nel 5%. Il disturbo cessa spontaneamente alla pubertà in quasi tutti i casi.",

      "title": "Presenting Symptoms of Pituitary Apoplexy",
      "abstract": "Abstract The classical term “pituitary apoplexy” (PA) describes a clinical syndrome usually characterized by abrupt onset of headache accompanied by neurologic and/or endocrinologic deterioration due to sudden expansion of a mass within the sella turcica as a result of hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor and adjacent pituitary gland. PA is a medical emergency and a difficult diagnosis to establish. Thus this article reviews the presenting symptoms of PA patients to help clinicians recognize or at least suspect this critical condition early on. PA commonly occurs in the setting of a preexisting adenoma, and several patients are unaware of its existence prior to the onset of apoplexy symptoms, which are mainly of a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic nature. Neurologic symptoms include sudden-onset severe headache and other symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms from compression of the cavernous sinus contents, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. Ophthalmologic symptoms include visual field defects, visual loss, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. Endocrinologic disturbances include pituitary adenoma symptoms, cortisol deficiency, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice to aid the PA diagnosis. Its differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accidents, infectious diseases, and other causes of endocrinologic imbalance. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice, especially if there are associated visual abnormalities and ophthalmoplegia. Clinicians should be aware of the presenting symptoms because early diagnosis may reduce the morbidity and mortality of this neurosurgical emergency.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

Cerebral infarction, to our knowledge, has not been reported in association with MA. We now report four patients with a history of MA who developed cerebral infarction. Infarctions were occipital in two cases, frontoparietal in one case and parietal and cerebellar in one case. All patients showed good recovery.

      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

It is a highly heritable disease with one third of patients having a family history and a mutation in one of three genes. The ideal time to treat neurodegenerative disease may be before clinical presentation, at a point where the minimum of irreversible neuronal loss has occurred and cognitive function is still preserved.",

It results from damage to the structures of the cerebellum and its connections or the posterior cords of the spinal cord. It should be noted that, in addition to occurring as part of many diseases, pediatric ataxia is a common symptom in neurometabolic diseases. To date, there are more than 150 inherited metabolic disorders that can manifest as ataxia in children. Neuroimaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spinal cord) are essential in the diagnosis of ataxia, and genetic studies are performed when metabolic diseases are suspected. It is important to remember that most of these disorders are progressive if left untreated. Therefore, it is crucial to include neurometabolic disorders in the differential diagnosis of ataxia, so that an early diagnosis can be made. Initiating prompt treatment influences positive neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

      "abstract": "A concussion occurs when a direct or indirect force is transmitted to the brain, causing a change in brain function. Given that approximately half the brain circuits are involved in vision and the control of eye movements, a concussion frequently results in visual symptoms. Ophthalmic abnormalities are helpful in the assessment of acute concussion, identified by rapid automized naming tasks and eye movement assessments. In particular, convergence, eye-tracking and the vestibular-ocular motor screening tool may be used. For patients suffering from post-concussion syndrome more than 3 months from the original injury, abnormalities may be found in convergence, accommodation and smooth pursuit. Orthoptic exercises are useful rehabilitation tools to allow patients to return to school, work and recreation. This article provides a brief overview of concussion as it relates to vision and ophthalmic practice.",

It therefore represents a more severe subset of epilepsy, which can be generally characterized as frequent or severe seizures leading to cerebral dysfunction. This disturbance in cerebral functioning can in turn hinder, somewhat dramatically, cognitive development and further impact the future lives of patients. In this paper, we describe the cognitive consequences of status epilepticus in children and in adults in the context of plasticity theories. Recent studies maintain that consequences of SE may be severe cognitive sequelae, especially in early life. Since the residual consequences of SE in adulthood seem less detrimental and long-lasting, we argue that early life insults, such as those created by SE, during a rapid period of development and functional specialization, result in specific cognitive deficits dependent on the sensitive period at which SE occurred.",

Therefore, these disorders should be differentiated from syncope and should not be ignored by the cardiologist, who is usually a reference point for patients with syncope or suspected syncope. Clinical findings that suggest psychogenic pseudosyncope include frequent attacks always in the presence of audience, a fall to the ground that may develop slowly enough to allow the patient to stagger and break the fall before hitting the floor, prolonged attacks (>10 min), many psychosomatic symptoms as the clinical context. In most cases, the differential diagnosis should be made with neurally mediated syncope; to this end, tilt test appears to be very useful. Cataplexy is a relevant symptom of narcolepsy; the differential diagnosis between cataplexy and syncope should be made only when symptoms of narcolepsy are mild. Clinical findings that suggest cataplexy include an emotional trigger - above all if the emotion is positive -, an \"unreal\" fall similar to that observed in patients with psychogenic pseudosyncope, repeated attacks in a daytime, symptoms of narcolepsy as the clinical context. Since cataleptic attacks are triggered by emotion, in most cases the differential diagnosis should be made with vasovagal syncope; a positive emotion as a trigger suggests a cataleptic attack.",

      "abstract": "A close relationship seems to exist both clinically and psychopathologically between impairment of consciousness and its consequence in memory function-circumscribed amnesia-and the amnestic or Korsakow syndrome. In many cases an amnestic syndrome develops out of conditions of loss or impairment of consciousness or it initiates a clinical course which leads to impairment or loss of consciousness and eventually even to death. Although in such cases the amnestic syndrome is usually of short duration, numerically they seem to be more frequent than the chronic symptomatologically unchanging cases which one sees in alcoholics and seniles. Psychopathologically amnesia represents an unselective loss of memory for a limited period of time, due to lack or impairment of perceptual awareness. The amnestic syndrome on the other hand represents a selective type of memory dysfunction whereby recent personal memories cannot be recalled. It seems to be due to impairment of an integrative function other than perceptual awareness namely awareness of the personal meaning of events which is necessary for the registration of events as personal experiences available for future recall. Intact perceptual awareness is an essential pre-requisite for awareness of personal meaning but the latter is also dependent on the emotional charge of the situation. Consequently lesions and processes involving those structures of the brain functionally responsible for perceptual awareness and/or for emotional functions may be expected to lead to an amnestic syndrome. This is born out by neuropathological findings which demonstrate pathological changes in the hypothalamus in cases with impairment of consciousness and in the mammillary bodies with Korsakow's syndrome. The mammillary bodies form part of the activating system responsible for conscious perceptual awareness as well as of Papez' harmonious mechanism of the emotions.",

      "abstract": "El Dano Cerebral Adquirido (DCA) es una alteracion de la actividad neuronal en areas del cerebro que ocurre despues del nacimiento. Las secuelas tras un episodio de DCA pueden ser motoras, cognitivas, sociales, entre otras, que pueden transformar la vida de los pacientes en los ambitos educativo, laboral y familiar. Las causas del DCA pueden ser traumaticas y no traumaticas, siendo las mas comunes el Accidente Cerebrovascular (ACV) o Ictus y el Traumatismo Craneoencefalico (TCE). El ACV es la segunda causa de muerte y la principal causa de discapacidad a largo plazo a nivel mundial. La organizacion mundial de la salud estima que para el ano 2020 el TCE adelantara a muchas enfermedades para colocarse a la cabeza como principal causa de discapacidad. La neurorrehabilitacion es un proceso clinico complejo dirigido a restituir, minimizar y/o compensar las alteraciones, fisicas y cognitivas, en las personas discapacitadas como consecuencia de una lesion del sistema nervioso. La neurorrehabilitacion es la principal alternativa para reducir el impacto de los deficits derivados de las lesiones cerebrales. En el area funcional o fisica, la neurorrehabilitacion busca que los pacientes puedan alcanzar la maxima recuperacion integral posible y la capacidad para realizar actividades de la vida diaria necesarias para desarrollar una vida independiente, relacionadas con la manipulacion de objetos del entorno en las que la extremidad superior (ES) esta directamente implicada. La gran variedad de movimientos y la complejidad de la ES hace que sea necesario el desarrollo de metodos de evaluacion objetivos que permitan identificar con exactitud la mejora de los pacientes en la ejecucion de movimientos. La evaluacion motora de la ES de pacientes con DCA se realiza habitualmente mediante test clinicos subjetivos. Estos test se caracterizan por ser altamente dependientes de los criterios y experiencia del examinador, asi como de factores del entorno que pueden alterar los resultados. La evaluacion Fugl-Meyer (EFM) es uno de los test estandarizados mas usados tanto en la practica clinica como en estudios de investigacion. La EFM tiene por objetivo evaluar el desempeno fisico de los pacientes con DCA. El creciente numero de sujetos con DCA y la falta de herramientas de valoracion objetiva estandarizada, hace necesaria la creacion de nuevos metodos que permitan modelar, cuantificar, evaluar e interpretar de manera detallada y precisa el movimiento de la ES. El objetivo principal de la Tesis es desarrollar una nueva metodologia de evaluacion motora objetiva basada en la evaluacion Fugl-Meyer de la ES en pacientes con dano cerebral adquirido. La metodologia de los trabajos utilizada y los resultados alcanzados en la Tesis Doctoral son los siguientes: 1. Modelado de la evaluacion Fugl-Meyer. Como primera parte de esta investigacion, se realiza el modelado y formalizacion del conocimiento asociado a la ejecucion de los movimientos de la EFM de la ES. El modelado de la EFM permite la generacion de modelos cinematicos de referencia usados como linea base para el analisis de movimientos patologicos. 2. Cuantificacion de los movimientos de la evaluacion Fugl-Meyer. Se disena, desarrolla y valida la metodologia para la cuantificacion del movimiento de sujetos sanos y de pacientes. Esta metodologia se basada en la definicion y el calculo de metricas cinematicas para la obtencion de parametros que caracterizan el movimiento. La cuantificacion de los movimientos permite dos resultados principales: en primer lugar, la discriminacion entre movimientos realizados por sujetos sanos y por pacientes. En segundo lugar, la definicion del perfil disfuncional a partir de parametros de movimiento que caracterizan la funcion motora de cada paciente. 3. Evaluacion motora objetiva de la extremidad superior. Se disena, desarrolla y valida la metodologia de evaluacion motora objetiva de los movimientos de la EFM de la ES realizados por pacientes con DCA. Esta metodologia se basa en el calculo de la puntuacion de los parametros de movimiento de los pacientes mediante el algoritmo implementado para este fin. Por tanto, la evaluacion motora objetiva de la ES permite estimar de manera automatica un score por cada movimiento de la EFM y un score global para todos los movimientos. 4. Interpretacion del score global objetivo. Se realiza un analisis granular de los scores estimados por el algoritmo de evaluacion, que permite la interpretacion de la funcion motora de la ES de los pacientes con DCA. La interpretacion se realiza con un nivel de detalle superior al disponible usando solo retroalimentacion visual. Los resultados obtenidos han permitido alcanzar los objetivos planteados en la Tesis. Los metodos de evaluacion motora objetiva de la ES en pacientes con DCA permiten mejorar los modelos actuales de neurorrehabilitacion motora. Por tanto, los metodos propuestos pueden aumentar la precision del diagnostico y lograr una rehabilitacion fisica mas personalizada, basada en la evidencia y potencialmente efectiva de los pacientes con DCA. ----------ABSTRACT---------- The acquired brain injury (ABI) is an alteration of neuronal activity in areas of the brain that occurs after birth. The sequels after an episode of ABI can be motor, cognitive, social, among others, which can transform lives of patients in the educational, work and family environments. ABI can be caused by a traumatic or non-traumatic injury. The most common ABIs are cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Stroke is the second most common cause of death and is a major cause of long-term disability worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that by the year 2020 the TBI will overtake many diseases to take the lead as the main cause of disability. The main objectives of physical neurorehabilitation are to restore and to compensate deficits to achieve maximum functional capacity, facilitating independence and reintegration in the family and social environments. Neurorehabilitation is a complex clinical process aimed at restoring, minimizing and/or compensating the alterations, physical and cognitive, in people with disabilities because of a nervous system injury. Neurorehabilitation is the main alternative, to reduce the impact of deficits derived from brain injuries. In the functional or physical area, neurorehabilitation looking at patients can achieve the maximum possible full recovery and the capacity to perform activities of daily life required for an independent life, in terms of the handling of objects in the environments in which the upper extremity (UE) is directly involved. The great variety of movements and the complexity of the UE makes it necessary to develop objective assessment methods that allow to accurately detect the improvement of patients in the movements execution. UE motor assessment of patients with ABI is usually done through subjective clinical tests. These tests are highly dependent on the examiner’s criteria and experience, as well as environmental factors that may alter the results. The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) is one of the most used standardized tests both in clinical practice and in research. The aim of the FMA is to evaluate the physical performance of patients with ABI. The growing number of subjects with ABI and the lack of standardized objective assessment tools, make necessary to create new methods that allow to model, quantify, evaluate and interpret the UE movement in a detailed, accurate and reliable way. The main goal of this Thesis is to develop a novel objective motor assessment methodology based on the Fugl-Meyer assessment of the UE of patients with acquired brain damage. This PhD Thesis has achieved the following results: 1. Fugl-Meyer assessment modeling: first part of this research is the modeling and formalization of the knowledge associated to the execution of the FMA movements of the UE. The FMA modeling allows the generation of reference kinematic models used as a baseline for the analysis of pathological movements. 2. Quantification of the Fugl-Meyer assessment movements. The methodology for the quantification of the movement of healthy subjects and patients is designed, developed and validated. This methodology is based on the definition and calculation of kinematic metrics to obtain parameters that characterize the movement. The quantification of the movements allows two main results: first, the discrimination between movements made by healthy subjects and by patients. Secondly, the definition of the dysfunctional profile from movement parameters that characterize the motor function of each patient. 3. Objective motor assessment of the upper extremity. The methodology of objective motor assessment of the FMA movements of the ES performed by patients with ABI is designed, developed and validated. This methodology is based on the calculation of the score of the movement parameters of patients by using the algorithm implemented for this purpose. Therefore, the objective motor assessment of the UE allows to automatically estimate a score for each movement of the FMA and a global score for all movements. 4. Interpretation of the global objective score. A granular analysis of the scores estimated by the assessment algorithm is performed, which allows the interpretation of the UE motor function of patients with ABI. The interpretation is performed with a level of detail superior to that available using only visual feedback. The results have allowed to reach the proposed objectives in this PhD Thesis. This Thesis provide a new objective assessment tool for therapists to help them improve the diagnostic accuracy and to achieve a more personalized, evidence based and potentially effective physical rehabilitation of brain injury patients.",

Proper diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction allows you to implement appropriate treatment plan that will allow adequate emptying and prevention of complications that may endanger the patient's life. The evolution of spinal cord injuries can distinguish three phases: 1) spinal shock phase, 2) the recovery phase, 3) final phase. After spinal trauma bladder is affected mostly in two ways: 1) Spastic (reflex) bladder caused in lesion above voiding center (S2-S4 segments), 2) Flaccid (atonic) neuropathic bladder emerges in lesion at the voiding center (S2-S4) or below it, as well as lesions of the peripheral innervation of bladder, 3) Autonomic disreflection syndrome develops in patient with cervical or high thoracic spinal cord lesions, above the Th 1 segment, 4) Uninhibited neurogenic bladder develops in incomplete nerve pathway lesions in cerebral cortex, pyramidal pathway or in spinal cord-cerebral voiding control debilitate. The diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is established by urodynamic examination, laboratory blood and urine findings as well as radiographic, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal column.

Current models implicate the cerebral cortex in the genesis of seizures, although thalamic mechanisms (particularly the thalamic reticular formation) are involved in the synchronization of cortical neurons. Often, the precipitants of a seizure in the critical care setting are pharmacological. Several mechanisms linked to critical illness can lead to seizures. Failure to remove glutamate and potassium from the extracellular space, functions performed predominantly by astrocytes, occurs in trauma, hypoxia, ischaemia, and hypoglycaemia. Loss of normal inhibition occurs during withdrawal from alcohol and other hypnosedative agents, or in the presence of GABA. Conditions such as cerebral trauma, haemorrhages, abscesses, and neoplasms all produce physical distortions of the adjacent neurons, astrocytes, and the extracellular space. Deposition of iron in the cortex from the breakdown of haemoglobin appears particularly epileptogenic.

The continuous care of comatose patients after cardiopulmonary arrest represents a major burden to the health care system, and family members should be adequately informed about the chances of recovery. Unlike most acute brain pathologies, which are focal, anoxia induces a global brain injury.

Previous studies have demonstrated diffuse damage to various hypothalamic systems, but the integrity of the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, a major arousal‐promoting system located in the posterior hypothalamus, has never been examined in head trauma patients. Here, we demonstrate that severe head trauma is associated with a marked loss (41%) of histaminergic neurons.

      "title": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain",
      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain Trigeminal neuralgiaEssentialsTrigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms of intense pain resembling electrical shocks on the other half of the face in the area of one or two of the branches of the trigeminal nerve.Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is not caused by any other disease and there are no findings in imaging investigations.First line drug is carbamazepine.In some patients, the symptom is relieved within a period of a few months, and thus the medication can be gradually reduced after achieving treatment response.Symptoms Between the attacks the pain is totally absent (remission phase), and in the active phase it may be provoked typically by touching certain areas of the face (trigger zones) or by eating. A new pain episode can be provoked after a refractory period that lasts from some seconds to some minutes. The pain comes in very short attacks of shooting pain or ”pins-and-needles” sensations. Additionally, continuous pain may occur. In the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, there are no permanent neurological deficiency symptoms. When at its worst, trigeminal neuralgia may prevent the patient from washing the face or brush the teeth and make her/him unable to speak or even eat and drink. Causes and diagnosis In idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia there is no underlying disease or vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve causing the condition. About 10% of the patients belong to this group. In the majority of patients the symptoms are explained by vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve in the brain stem. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia has similar symptoms as the idiopathic form but it is caused by another disease, e.g. MS or a brain stem tumour. Classification of trigeminal neuralgiaPotential trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve.Clinically confirmed trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the pain may be provoked by a typical stimulus (e.g. breath of wind, touch, eating, movement of the muscles of facial expression).Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia with confirmed aetiology: in addition to the criteria in item 2, vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve is detected by MRI, associated with morphological changes in the trigeminal nerve root (requires 3D reconstruction technique).Secondary trigeminal neuralgia: in addition to the criteria in item 2, an MS plaque or a tumour causing trigeminal neuralgia is detected by MRI.Treatment The drug of choice is carbamazepine which is dosed according to response. Oxcarbazepine is an alternative and may be tried especially if carbamazepine causes adverse effects (fatigue, dizziness) or when there is a need to avoid the interactions of carbamazepine with other drugs. It is a derivative of carbamazepine but better tolerated. Oxcarbazepine is as effective as carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia. The initial dose for carbamazepine is 100 mg × 2 and for oxcarbazepine 150 mg × 2. The dose can be increased up to 1 200 mg/24h with carbamazepine and up to 1 800 mg/24h with oxcarbazepine. In the beginning follow-up of blood cell counts and liver function tests is recommended. Carbamazepine concentration can be measured if there are signs of overdose (dizziness, tiredness, diplopia or nystagmus).Because trigeminal neuralgia has a tendency for spontaneous remission, a trial may be made to taper off the medication gradually after a few months.If trigeminal neuralgia remains refractory to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, the patient is referred to specialized care for therapeutic assessment (e.g. department of neurology or neurosurgery). The most commonly used neurosurgical treatment modalities include coagulation of the trigeminal ganglion and microvascular decompression, i.e. microsurgical release of the nerve compression caused by a small nearby artery . Other drugs may be tried if carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are ineffective or not tolerated and the patient is not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment. There is evidence on the effectiveness of lamotrigine as an add-on drug to carbamazepine (note: risk for skin rash when increasing thedosage). Also baclofen has been shown to have effect in trigeminal neuralgia. Dosage may be increased up to 80 mg/24h if needed. Phenytoin, clonazepam, valproic acid, gabapentine or pregabalin may be tried as secondary alternatives, but there is no evidence of their efficacy. Intravenous phosphenytoin may be tried for severe exacerbations even if its efficacy has not been proven in randomized controlled trials. After the infusion the medication is continued orally aiming at an effective yet tolerable dosage. When one drug is not enough, a combination of several drugs with different action mechanisms may be tried in patients who are not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment.Therapy with botulinum toxin A (25–100 units) may be tried in trigeminus neuralgia refractory to the first-line drugs. Other facial pains Other neuropathic pain in the facial area In another type of facial neuropathic pain, a damage to a branch of the trigeminal nerve has led to a neuropathic pain state. The pain is usually long-term steady aching or burning, and the patient may in addition experience pains resembling electrical shocks.The most common causes of facial neuropathic pain include facial injuries, sequelae of surgical interventions (e.g supraorbital nerve injury in association with Beck's trepanation of the frontal sinus) and postherpetic neuralgia . The pain may also emerge after a disturbance of the cerebral circulation (so-called central post stroke pain). In these patients, the pain and the sensory disturbance do not necessarily limit to the facial area. Careful sensory testing of the face or neurophysiological investigations will reveal abnormal findings.If a patient is diagnosed with facial neuropathic pain of unclear origin, he/she is referred to a neurologist for further investigations. Other facial pain Acute facial pain is most commonly caused by sinusitis or by factors of dental origin. The aetiology may also be a disturbance of the masticatory system, or the pain may be referred from the anterior neck (e.g. thyroiditis) or from the back of the neck (e.g. tension neck).So-called atypical facial pain, also called persistent (or chronic) idiopathic facial pain (PIFP), is a much more common type of prolonged facial pain than trigeminal neuralgia. The pain is usually constant and dull. It is not restricted to one half of the face and is also otherwise independent of dermatomal borders. The pain may be triggered by an intervention directed at the paranasal sinuses or at the teeth (not, however, being a complication of the intervention), infection or stress.PIFP most commonly occurs in middle-aged women. The patients are often subjected to psychosocial stress. Clinical examination of a patient with facial pain includes teeth, masticatory muscles, temporomandibular joints, cervical spine and muscles of the neck and shoulders. It may also be advisable to examine the ears, nose and throat as well as the eyes and the anterior neck.If neuropathic pain is suspected, a neurological examination is important especially concerning the cranial nerves.A patient with severe or progressive facial pain is referred for further investigations to specialized care either to the department of oral diseases, neurology or ENT or to a special pain clinic, according to the local practice guidelines. See also cluster headache . TreatmentOther neuropathic pain in the facial area The treatment of other neuropathic pains in the facial area follows the same conventional principles as the treatment of any neuropathic pain .First-line drugs for neuropathic pain are gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the SNRI group.Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP)PIFP is treated primarily with antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in small dosages, venlafaxine in similar dosage as in the treatment of depression.Other facial painTreatment is determined by the cause of the pain. If the pain is suspected to originate from dental occlusion or from the teeth, the patient is referred to a dentist for assessment.

      "title": "Brain consequences of acute kidney injury: Focusing on the hippocampus",
      "abstract": "The high mortality rates associated with acute kidney injury are mainly due to extra-renal complications that occur following distant-organ involvement. Damage to these organs, which is commonly referred to as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, has more severe and persistent effects. The brain and its sub-structures, such as the hippocampus, are vulnerable organs that can be adversely affected. Acute kidney injury may be associated with numerous brain and hippocampal complications, as it may alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Although the pathogenesis of acute uremic encephalopathy is poorly understood, some of the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to hippocampal involvement include the release of multiple inflammatory mediators that coincide with hippocampus inflammation and cytotoxicity, neurotransmitter derangement, transcriptional dysregulation, and changes in the expression of apoptotic genes. Impairment of brain function, especially of a structure that has vital activity in learning and memory and is very sensitive to renal ischemic injury, can ultimately lead to cognitive and functional complications in patients with acute kidney injury. The objective of this review was to assess these complications in the brain following acute kidney injury, with a focus on the hippocampus as a critical region for learning and memory.

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "title": "Limb weakness",
      "abstract": "The definition of weakness is important, because many patients who self-describe a ‘weak limb’ will actually have a clumsy limb (ataxia), a numb limb (reduced sensation), or a limb that is too painful to move. The time course of the onset of the symptoms in general reflects the time course of the underlying pathology: • Sudden onset (seconds to minutes) usually implies either trauma (e.g. displaced vertebral fractures due to major trauma) or certain vascular insults (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA)). • Subacute onset (hours to days) suggests a progressive demyelination (e.g. Guillain–Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis) or a slowly expanding haematoma (e.g. subdural haematoma). • Chronic onset (weeks to months), is consistent with pathologies such as a slow-growing tumour or motor neuron disease (progressive degeneration of motor neurons). As only acute and subacute limb weakness will present acutely to generalists in hospital (chronic onset cases will most likely be referred to neurology from primary care), we have limited the chapter to these cases. Limb movement requires an intact pathway from the cerebral cortex, down the corona radiata, internal capsule, and pons, along the corticospinal tract of the spinal cord, out along a nerve root, and down a peripheral nerve to the neuromuscular junction and muscle itself. If a patient has limb weakness, there must be a lesion somewhere in this pathway. Figure 26.2 gives the differential diagnosis for limb weakness. Mr Walker has presented with rapid onset of left-sided arm weakness. Key clues in the history to elicit include: • Exact time of onset? This is critical in suspected strokes because the window of time in which to confirm the diagnosis and administer thrombolysis (if appropriate) is only 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms (after that, you risk doing more harm than good to the patient). If you suspect a stroke in a patient within that time frame, call the thrombolysis team immediately. In this case, all we can say is that the onset was at some point in the 7 hours between 11 p.m. (when he went to sleep) and 6 a.m. (when he woke up), so we cannot confidently say the onset was within 4.5 hours.",

The injury involves a heterogenous pattern of focal and/or diffuse axonal injury, leading to a wide range of symptoms. The severity of the injury covers the spectrum from mild to moderate to severe, with severe injury leading to possible coma and even death. The range of symptoms, the variability in treatment options and prognosis, as well as the psychosocial implications, make it a complex injury that often calls upon the services of neurosurgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists to help patients achieve the best possible outcome. This chapter aims to provide an overview of TBI that includes the classification, epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, long-term outcome, diagnostic implications, and differential diagnosis, as well as possible treatment options and future directions for research.",

And this is no less true whether one deals with disease directly involving the central nervous system or with the effects on it of disease having its origin elsewhere. This report is concerned with secondary effects. Neuropsychiatric complications of underlying disease may vary widely from mild aberrations of normal mood and behavior to sweeping disturbances that dominate the entire clinical picture and may obscure the disease itself. The basis for these reactions depends primarily on the fundamental nature of brain metabolism. The central nervous system has the most exacting metabolic requirements in the body.

The clinical and pathologic findings are closely correlated. Ataxia and chorea are related to severe neuronal loss in the dentate nucleus with calcification in the globus pallidus. Dementia occurs with progressive demyelination of the centrum semiovale, and loss of posterior column function occurs with neuroaxonal dystrophy of the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus.",

      "abstract": "Seizures may herald, complicate, or become persistent sequellae of acute neurologic disorders such as acute cerebrovascular insult (stroke or hemorrhage), bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis, and head trauma. The occurrence of seizures in patients with primary neurological insults invariably adds an additional layer of complexity to patient management. For example, diminished arousal after generalized tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus (SE) may put a patient at risk for aspiration or hypoxia and may warrant airway protection via intubation and mechanical ventilation. Many patients will develop aspiration pneumonia. Phasic and substantial increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) during generalized tonic clonic seizures may lead to brain herniation in the setting of an existing mass lesion such as an acute stroke, hemorrhage, or brain tumor. Increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), hypoxemia, and metabolic or respiratory acidosis may accompany generalized tonic-clonic seizures and complicate the management of patients with acute stroke, sepsis, cardiac ischemia, or pulmonary edema Finally, systemic toxicity of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be encountered and cause medical complications such as cardiac dysrhythmia, hypotension, the Stevens—Johnson syndrome, other hypersensitivity reactions, and hepatic failure. Some of these complications may be life threatening even if the underlying neurologic event is not. It is important for the clinician, whether in the outpatient, hospital ward, or Emergency Department setting, to remember that a first-time seizure may herald a potentially significant and even disastrous neurologic event. This chapter will focus on the etiologic, diagnostic, and treatment implications of seizures in several acute neurologic disorders such as arterial and venous cerebral infarcts, intracerebral hemorrhage, including hypertensive, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis, and brain trauma.",

Cerebral thrombosis cases show insidious onset and cerebral haemorrhage patients will be having sudden onset. Severe malignant hypertension, cerebral arterial atherosclerosis usually induces this disease. Severe hypertension causes aneurysm and rupture of one of the cerebral arteries and results in sudden Hemiplegia. Hemiplegia may be contrilateral or ipsilateral.

Here we relate experimental findings of fibromyalgia symptoms to anatomical and functional brain changes. Neuroimaging studies show augmented sensory processing in pain-related areas, which, together with gray matter decreases and neurochemical abnormalities in areas related to pain modulation, supports the psychophysical evidence of altered pain perception and inhibition. Gray matter decreases in areas related to emotional decision making and working memory suggest that cognitive disturbances could be related to brain alterations. Altered levels of neurotransmitters involved in sleep regulation link disordered sleep to neurochemical abnormalities. Thus, current evidence supports the view that at least some fibromyalgia symptoms are associated with brain dysfunctions or alterations, giving the long-held \"it is all in your head\" view of the disorder a new meaning.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting peripheral nerves. The causes are multiple: hereditary, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, toxic, traumatic. The temporal profile includes acute, subacute and chronic conditions. The majority of peripheral neuropathies cause mainly muscle weakness and sensory loss, positive sensory symptoms and sometimes pain. When pain is present, however, it is usually extremely intense and among the most disabling symptoms for the patients. In addition, the neurological origin of the pain is often missed and patients receive inadequate or delayed specific treatment. Independently of the disease causing the peripheral nerve injury, pain originating from axonal pathology or ganglionopathy privileges neuropathies affecting smaller fibres, a clinical observation that points towards abnormal activity within nociceptive afferents as a main generator of pain. Natural activation of blood vessels or perineurial nociceptive network by pathology also causes intense pain. Pain of this kind, i.e. nerve trunk pain, is among the heralding symptoms of inflammatory or ischemic mononeuropathy and for its intensity represents itself a medical emergency. Neuropathic pain quality rekindles the psychophysical experience of peripheral nerves intraneural microstimulation i.e. a combination of large and small fibres sensation temporally distorted compared to physiological perception evoked by natural stimuli. Pins and needles, burning, cramping mixed with numbness, and tingling are the wording most used by patients. Nociceptive pain instead is most often described as aching, deep and dull. Good command of peripheral nerve anatomy and pathophysiology allows timely recognition of the different pain components and targeted treatment, selected according to intensity, type and temporal profile of the pain.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterised by progressive neuronal death and neurological dysfunction, leading to increased disability and a loss of cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have neurodegeneration as a primary feature. However, in other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, neurodegeneration follows another insult, such as demyelination or ischaemia. Although there are different primary causes to these diseases, they all share a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can occur through the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia, cells of the innate and adaptive peripheral immune system, meningeal inflammation and autoantibodies directed towards components of the CNS. Despite chronic inflammation being pathogenic in these diseases, local inflammation after insult can also promote endogenous regenerative processes in the CNS, which are key to slowing disease progression. The normal ageing process in the healthy brain is associated with a decline in physiological function, a steady increase in levels of neuroinflammation, brain shrinkage and memory deficits. Likewise, ageing is also a key contributor to the progression and exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. As there are associated co-morbidities within an ageing population, pinpointing the precise relationship between ageing and neurodegenerative disease progression can be a challenge. The CNS has historically been considered an isolated, \"immune privileged\" site, however there is mounting evidence that adaptive immune cells are present in the CNS of both healthy individuals and diseased patients. Adaptive immune cells have also been implicated in both the degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. In this review, we will discuss the key role of the adaptive immune system in CNS degeneration and regeneration, with a focus on how ageing influences this crosstalk.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) can be considered a complex multi-organ disorder with highly variable extra-intestinal, including neurological, involvement. Cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, headache, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric diseases are complications frequently reported. These manifestations may be present at the onset of the typical disease or become clinically evident during its course. However, CD subjects with subclinical neurological involvement have also been described, as well as patients with clear central and/or peripheral nervous system and intestinal histopathological disease features in the absence of typical CD manifestations. Based on these considerations, a sensitive and specific diagnostic method that is able to detect early disease process, progression, and complications is desirable. In this context, neurophysiological techniques play a crucial role in the non-invasive assessment of central nervous system excitability and conductivity. Moreover, some of these tools are known for their valuable role in early diagnosis and follow-up of several neurological diseases or systemic disorders such as CD with nervous system involvement, even at the subclinical level. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the neurophysiological basis of CD using electroencephalography, multimodal evoked potentials, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The evidence examined here seems to converge on an overall profile of \"hyperexcitable celiac brain\", which partially recovers after institution of a gluten-free diet. The main translational correlate is that in case of subclinical neurological involvement or overt unexplained symptoms, neurophysiology could contribute to the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of a potentially underlying CD.",

Disorders of consciousness mainly comprise the comatose state, the vegetative state, and the minimally conscious state. These disorders typically stem from acute brain insults caused by hypoxic-ischemic neural injury or traumatic brain injury, and the type of brain injury frequently determines the neuropathology. Current knowledge, including results from our laboratory, supports a model of extended brain tissue damage from the midbrain to the cortex in anoxia patients and a model of focal or multifocal cortical lesions in trauma patients. These differing models may help to explain differences in prognosis and outcomes in these excruciating life situations. Although the neural basis of consciousness remains puzzling, findings from normal volunteers and pathologies of consciousness show that widely distributed networks such as thalamofrontal and parietofrontal systems may be critical.",

It may have variable presentations ranging from intact neurological status to non-survivable damage and the subjects may be surprisingly apathetic to pain. It is even unusual for such an injury to have an excellent prognosis despite coming late to clinical attention. Case presentations We report two cases of patients with psychotic depression who attempted suicide by hammering nails into their heads. On imaging, deep penetration within the brain parenchyma was noted; however, neither case had any neurological deficit or symptoms attributable to brain trauma. Conclusions Self-inflicted penetrating brain injuries with peculiar objects such as nails are rarely encountered in practice. They need prompt management for their removal and addressing the underlying mental health illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hyperexcitability of the neural network often occurs after brain injuries or degeneration and is a key pathophysiological feature in certain neurological diseases such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and tinnitus. Although the standard approach of pharmacological treatments is to directly suppress the hyperexcitability through reducing excitation or enhancing inhibition, different techniques for stimulating brain activity are often used to treat refractory neurological conditions. However, it is unclear why stimulating brain activity would be effective for controlling hyperexcitability. Recent studies suggest that the pathogenesis in these disorders exhibits a transition from an initial activity loss after acute injury or progressive neurodegeneration to subsequent development of hyperexcitability. This process mimics homeostatic activity regulation and may contribute to developing network hyperexcitability that underlies neurological symptoms. This hypothesis also predicts that stimulating brain activity should be effective in reducing hyperexcitability due to homeostatic activity regulation and in relieving symptoms. Here we review current evidence of homeostatic plasticity in the development of hyperexcitability in some neurological diseases and the effects of brain stimulation. The homeostatic plasticity hypothesis may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of neurological diseases and may guide the use of brain stimulation techniques for treating them.",

Clinical signs of sensory nerve injury may include paresthesia, dysesthesia, anesthesia, and neuropraxia. Nerve endings completely restore within up to 6 months, but in some cases, the injury can be catastrophic. The article presents the authors’ personal clinical observations.",

      "title": "Non-invasive acoustic neuroma treatment via Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery",
      "abstract": "When a patient's audiometric evaluation or case history reveals unilateral or asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, combined with other indicators such as absence of acoustic reflex, non-pulsatile tinnitus confined to the affected ear, loss of balance, dizziness, otalgia, facial pain or numbness (trigeminal neuralgia), clogged ear feeling, swallowing difficulty, vertigo, or mental confusion, the hearing healthcare professional should recommend further testing to rule out acoustic neuroma. Tests to establish a definitive diagnosis of acoustic neuroma include auditory brainstem response (ABR), electronystagmography, enhanced stereotactic computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).1 The latter technique is considered the most efficacious in determining the presence and size of a neuroma.2 The MRI can also rule out other retrocochlear causes of hearing loss such as viral neuronitis (damage to the sensory neurons of the vestibular ganglion), trauma, hemorrhage, or other neurologic disease.FigureACOUSTIC NEUROMA Acoustic neuromas (also known as vestibular schwannomas, peripheral fibroblastomas, or cerebellopontine angle tumors) are spontaneous, solitary, non-malignant, non-hereditary, slow-growing, primary brain tumors that diminish quality of life. In more than 80% of cases they arise from the superior vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve).3 Acoustic neuroma is one of the most common types of brain tumors, representing approximately 6% of all intracranial tumors, 30% of brainstem tumors, and 85% of tumors in the region of the cerebellopontine angle at the base of the brain, where the vestibulocochlear nerve leaves the skull cavity and enters the bony structure of the inner ear.4 Tumors large enough to cause retrocochlear hearing loss and other neurologic symptoms occur in about one person in 100,000, or approximately 3000 cases a year.5 The hearing loss is due to direct compression of the cochlear nerve or secondary to interruption of the blood supply to the cochlea. An acoustic neuroma is created by an over-proliferation of Schwann cells covering the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve as it passes through the internal auditory canal (IAC). In 95% of cases they occur unilaterally; they are rarely found in children and occur more frequently in women than in men in the range of 30 to 60 years of age. Some studies have suggested that long-term exposure to loud noise or radiation from cell phones may be causal factors in tumor development. As the acoustic neuroma grows, it can cause progressive hearing loss (usually the first symptom), taste dysfunction, visual deficits, facial weakness, pain or paralysis, and can eventually press on the trigeminal nerve, causing facial numbness or pain.6 Large neuromas can apply pressure on the lower cranial nerves causing swallowing and speech problems. If the acoustic neuroma becomes extremely large, its pressure on the brainstem can cause life-threatening hydrocephalus. Early diagnosis of acoustic neuroma is the key to preventing its serious consequences. Approximately 5% of acoustic neuromas are bilateral. They are most commonly found in patients with the inherited genetic disorder known as neurofibromatosis–type 2 (NF-2).7 Persons with NF-2 have a 50% chance of passing this disorder to their children. Whereas most spontaneous unilateral acoustic neuromas occur in patients between age 30 and 60 (mean age of onset is 50 years), bilateral acoustic neuromas can occur in children as young as 8 or 9 (mean age of onset is 31 years) and ultimately cause deafness in both ears. In addition to acoustic neuromas, individuals with NF-2 usually develop tumors of the nerves that control swallowing, speech, sight, and facial movement/sensation. In some patients, an auditory prosthesis known as an auditory brainstem implant can help restore hearing.8 Types of acoustic neuromas Based on the MRI scan, acoustic neuromas can be placed in one of three classifications: Entirely intracanalicular: The entire tumor is approximately 1 cm or less in size and is confined to the bony canal. This tumor poses no threat to the brain or cranial nerves other than VII and VIII, which are in the bony canal. Intracranial extension without brain stem distortion: The intracranial portion of the tumor is less than 1–2 cm. These cisternal tumors have demonstrated a propensity to grow and should be removed before they become life threatening Intracranial extension with brain stem distortion: The intracranial portion of the tumor is larger than 2 cm and is pressing on the brainstem. These compressive tumors should be addressed as soon as possible, taking into account the patient's age and condition of health. TREATMENT OPTIONS Once it has been determined that a patient has an acoustic neuroma and its size and location have been evaluated, the patient (and physician) can consider one of three treatment options: Medical management/observation: small to medium-sized tumor, less than 2 to 3.9 cm. Microsurgical excision: small to large tumor, less than 2 cm to greater than 4 cm Single-event Gamma Knife® stereotactic radiosurgery: small to medium tumor, less than 2 to 3.9 cm, or Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSR) on medium to large tumors. FSR allows the Gamma Knife to deliver smaller doses of radiation over a longer period, thereby minimizing the effect of radiation on the normal brain. Option 1: Medical management/ observation If a patient is found to have a very small acoustic neuroma, or the tumor is in the patient's only or better hearing ear, careful observation over time may be the preferred management modality. This is particularly appropriate for older patients whose tumors are static or slow-growing and are not expected to present serious symptoms during the patient's normal life expectancy.10 In this approach, the potential complications of surgery, and to a lesser extent those of stereotactic radiosurgery, can be avoided, although the potential loss of hearing is significant.11 Periodic MRI scans to track tumor growth, use of hearing aids where appropriate, and monitoring of the patient's neurologic status are recommended.12 Option 2: Microsurgical excision The first successful surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma, i.e., the patient survived, is reported to have occurred in 1895. During the early 20th century, patients with acoustic neuroma usually presented with very large tumors, causing significant brainstem compression. In these instances, the surgical mortality rate often exceeded 80%. In the second half of the century the introduction of the operating microscope and advanced medical imaging technologies (CT and MRI) allowed the development of microsurgical excision techniques that shifted the focus of surgery from prolonging life to preserving hearing and facial nerve function.13 There are three basic approaches to microsurgical removal of an acoustic neuroma: (1) translabyrinthine, (2) suboccipital/retrosigmoid, and (3) middle fossa. Otologists/neurotologists, ENTs, and neurosurgeons may use variations of the basic approaches, depending on their experience and skill level. The choice of surgical approach is generally based on the size of the tumor; the patient's age, medical condition, pre-operative hearing thresholds, and speech-discrimination abilities; and the surgeon's preference. The translabyrinthine craniotomy (TLC) approach, developed by William F. House, MD, of the House Ear Institute, is employed when there is no useful hearing in the affected ear or when attempts to preserve hearing ability would be impractical. In the TLC approach, the surgeon enters the skull behind the ear and removes the mastoid bone and the hearing and balance structures of the inner ear. This method allows for complete removal of tumors of any size and permits the surgeon to identify the facial nerve in the temporal bone prior to excising the tumor. No attempt is made to save hearing ability in the affected ear since the approach through the temporal bone destroys the cochlea.14-15 Because there is no need to retract the brain with this approach, TLC is considered the safest of the surgical alternatives. The suboccipital/retrosigmoid craniotomy (SRC) approach is used on small to very large acoustic neuromas where the tumor extends into the posterior fossa. Instead of drilling through the mastoid and cochlea to access the neuroma as in the TLC approach, the SRC entails opening the skull behind the mastoid bone and pushing the cerebellum toward the midline to visualize and remove the tumor. When the tumor extends into the interior auditory canal (IAC), a small piece of the bone of the IAC is removed so the surgeon can access the portion of the tumor in the canal. A plug of soft tissue is used to close the IAC. The size of the tumor plays a significant role in determining if hearing or facial nerve function will be preserved. The middle fossa craniotomy approach, also developed at the House Ear Clinic, is employed when the primary goal is preservation of hearing.16 It is generally limited to tumors less than 2 cm in size contained in the inner auditory canal. The surgeon enters the skull above the ear and removes the bone overlying the tumor. The inner ear is not entered. Not only is hearing usually preserved with this approach, but also facial nerve dysfunction seldom occurs. Advantages and disadvantages of microsurgical excision The acoustic neuroma craniotomy procedures have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include complete removal of the tumor with slight risk of recurrence.17 If hearing has been preserved in a middle fossa or suboccipital retrosigmoid approach, it usually remains stable over time; hearing improvement occurs infrequently. When facial nerve dysfunction occurs following surgery, the condition may be transitory and improve over time. If facial nerve integrity is compromised, the patient may experience delayed onset of facial palsy and paralysis. In this case, a hypo-glossal nerve to facial nerve graft may be undertaken. Patient age and tumor size are associated with poor facial nerve outcome when the tumor was removed via either a translabyrinthine or a retrosigmoid approach.18 Among the disadvantages of craniotomy procedures are the risks associated with any neurosurgical procedure: infection, hemorrhage, seizures, reaction to anesthesia, trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) dysfunction, meningitis, cerebral spinal fluid leakage, psychosocial problems, and, in rare instances, surgical re-intervention.19 Removal of the tumor does not necessarily change, improve, or diminish the patient's tinnitus. Post-operative headache rate can exceed 50%, especially with the SRC approach.20 The risk of hearing loss is substantial for all methods of microsurgical excision: translabyrinthine, 100%; suboccipital/retrosigmoid, 60%; and, middle fossa, 40%. Acoustic neuroma surgery usually requires several days or more of hospitalization, a period of in-home convalescence, and limitations on physical activity. Patients may experience post-surgical vertigo and balance problems requiring vestibular rehabilitation. Option 3: Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery For patients found to have variably shaped acoustic neuroma ranging in diameter from several millimeters to more than 3 centimeters, the use of radiation, particularly Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery, is often a preferred treatment method.21 The Gamma Knife is a non-invasive, precision tool that treats brain lesions with such intensely focused gamma radiation that healthy tissue less than 2 millimeters from the target is essentially unaffected.22 The goal of stereotactic radiosurgery is to arrest tumor growth while preserving neurologic function.23 Long-term success of the procedure is predicated on the failure of the tumor to grow, and in some instances, shrinkage of the tumor. The Gamma Knife was developed by Lars Leksell, a professor of neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and the physicist and radiation biologist Borje Larsson of Uppsala University's Gustaf Werner Institute. The device was based on their research into combining radiation beams with stereotactic identification devices to isolate targets within the brain. Patient treatment via stereotactic radiosurgery began in 1967. The first Gamma Knife in the U.S. was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 1987. That device, and subsequent model upgrades, uses 201 cobalt 60 radiation emitters of approximately 30 curies each placed in a circular array in a heavily shielded steel collimator helmet that directs the gamma radiation to the target.24 To focus the beams of radiation precisely a light-weight stereotactic frame is secured to the patient's head.25 The patient is given local anesthesia or intravenous sedation and experiences only slight discomfort during frame application. Once the stereotactic frame is attached to the patient, a remote-controlled positioning system moves the patient into a shielded base and the 201 beams of gamma radiation are delivered. Radiation from the Gamma Knife causes tumor cell destruction by destroying the DNA intracellularly without the induction of an inflammatory response and by proliferative vasculopathy, in which the endothelial lining of the blood vessel is injured so that the smooth muscle cells proliferate and cause the vessel to close. Advantages and disadvantages of Gamma Knife The advantages of Gamma Knife® stereotactic radiosurgery include the following: It is non-invasive and may be used on residual tumors following surgery or portions of tumors that cannot be removed surgically without damaging brain tissue. The absence of an incision minimizes the risk of hemorrhage, infection, and adverse reaction to anesthesia. Facial and trigeminal nerve function can be preserved in most patients and in cases of small to medium-sized tumors, when pre-operative hearing is present, it may also be preserved. Gamma Knife treatments are usually performed in one session, which typically lasts from 12 to 60 minutes, depending on the type, size, and location of the target. Convalescent time is extremely short. There is no post-operative pain and post-operative rehabilitation is not required. No hair is shaved from the head. The cost of a Gamma Knife procedure is often 20% to 35% less than conventional neurosurgery and the procedure is usually performed on an out-patient basis. If hospitalization is required it is typically an overnight stay. Patients experience little discomfort and can immediately resume their previous activities. The disadvantages of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery are as follows: Risk of radiation-induced tumors developing in the future: To date, no documented cases secondary to stereotactic radiation have been reported. Radiation may not kill all the tumor cells. There is a slight risk that the tumor will grow in the future, so periodic MRI scans may be required to monitor tumor growth. If the radiation treatment is unsuccessful, the tumor is usually surgically removed. There is a very low to non-existent risk that the tumor will change biological characteristics and become malignant following radiographic treatment. CONCLUSION Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery is a highly effective, integrated solution for the non-invasive treatment of acoustic neuroma. It allows patients the option of tumor control versus tumor removal, thereby avoiding the need for brain surgery. The precision of Gamma Knife surgery makes it possible to administer a high radiation dose to the lesion, while minimizing the risk of collateral damage to adjacent healthy brain tissue. Stereotactic radiosurgery has also proven to be an extremely effective treatment modality for other benign brain tumors, malignant tumors, metastatic tumors, focal epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and arteriovenous malformations. More than 50,000 patients a year undergo Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery at more than 1100 treatment centers worldwide.28 The House Ear Clinic, which treats more acoustic neuromas than any other center in the world, has historically recommended, with rare exception, the surgical removal of the acoustic neuroma. It began offering Gamma Knife surgery as a treatment option in July 2006.",

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease is a dreaded complication of some rheumatologic disorders. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential. Any sudden neurologic event is suggestive of stroke; the time course, associated symptoms, and the patient’s own ecology will help determine the type of stroke. This article describes the various cerebrovascular syndromes and how specific rheumatologic diseases cause them to occur. The first step in examining a patient with sudden neurologic deficits is to differentiate stroke from other causes such as seizure and migraine. Seizures typically last less than 2 minutes and are associated with an altered level of consciousness and gradual resolution of symptoms; associated risk factors for seizures may be apparent. Migraine aura typically lasts longer than 5 minutes and the symptoms spread, expand, and are often positive sensory phenomena, such as tingling or light flashes. Headaches may precede or occur with the aura, although occasionally aura occurs without headache; this may often be difficult to differentiate from a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Once a stroke has been recognized, then it must be classified by subtype: cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage are often distinguished by decreased level of consciousness, headache, nausea or vomiting, and worsening over hours. Ischemic events are typically maximal at onset, without headache or altered consciousness. A TIA by definition lasts less than 24 hours, typically 5 to 15 minutes. The treatment of stroke is divided into acute stroke therapies and more long-term treatment of the underlying illness and prevention of recurrent strokes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Extensive neuropsychological testing is reported on a 30-year-old patient (TA) with amnesia persisting 3 ½ years after a major whiplash injury. TAs brain was investigated repeatedly with static and dynamic imaging techniques (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) without detecting signs indicative for her amnesia. This amnesia started immediately after the whiplash injury and made the former university student totally dependent on her mother's care and guidance. TA is disoriented with respect to time. She demonstrates a sharp border between superior knowledge of facts and episodes from the time prior to whiplash injury and no memories at all for the period after it. The amnesia is global and persistent in spite of superior intelligence. It is concluded that traumatic, stressful events can induce persistent memory blocks even in the absence of measurable brain injury. Furthermore, it is proposed that there are several stages of memory formation, and that both environmental and internal processes may block or interfere with a smooth information transfer. The consequence may be measurable as delayed amnesia. Key Words: whiplash injuryepisodic memoryretrograde amnesiapositron emission tomography",

This includes profound lethargy and coma, loss of basic brainstem reflexes and pupil reactivity, myoclonic jerks and seizures, and a burst suppression pattern on EEG. In the absence of a clear history of ingestion, clinicians may presume the presence of anoxic brain injury and that a progression towards brain death may be imminent. CASE REPORT:We report a case of a middle-aged woman found unresponsive who presented with apnea, loss of rudimentary neurologic findings on physical exam, burst suppression EEG findings, and a prolonged comatose state for nearly 48 h, followed by rapid resolution of symptoms secondary to a supratherapeutic baclofen ingestion. CONCLUSIONS:Baclofen toxicity can present both clinically and with EEG abnormalities consistent with anoxic brain injury, suggesting an inevitable progression to brain death. When provided with appropriate supportive care and prolonged observation, improvement with full neurologic recovery is often seen despite the initial grim clinical picture.",

      "abstract": "Post-stroke dementia (PSD) is a clinical entity that encompasses all types of dementia following an index stroke. Current evidence suggests that 25-30% of ischemic stroke survivors develop immediate or delayed vascular cognitive impairment or vascular dementia. The type of stroke can be either ischemic, hemorrhagic or hypoperfusive. There are multiple risk factors for PSD including older age, family history, genetic variants, low educational status, vascular comorbidities, prior transient ischemic attack or recurrent stroke and depressive illness. Pre-stroke dementia refers to the occurrence of cognitive impairment before the index stroke, which may be caused by a vascular burden as well as insidious neurodegenerative changes. Neuroimaging determinants of dementia after stroke include silent brain infarcts, white matter changes, lacunar infarcts and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Published clinical trials have not been promising and there is little information on whether PSD can be prevented using pharmacological agents. Control of vascular disease risk and prevention of recurrent strokes are key to reducing the burden of cognitive decline and post-stroke dementia. Modern imaging and analysis techniques will help to elucidate the mechanism of PSD and establish better treatment.",

Saturated very long chain fatty acids, either free in the cytoplasm of affected endocrine cells or as components of membrane lipids (e.g. gangliosides, glycerophospholipids, and proteolipid protein) in axons or myelin, may be central to the pathogenesis of these neuronal migration defects, dysmyelination/inflammatory demyelination and spinal tract degeneration.

Mild traumatic brain injuries are characterized by immediate physiological changes conceptualized as a multilayered neurometabolic cascade in which affected cells typically recover, although under certain circumstances a small number might degenerate and die. The primary pathophysiologies include ionic shifts, abnormal energy metabolism, diminished cerebral blood flow, and impaired neurotransmission. During the first week after injury the brain undergoes a dynamic restorative process. Athletes typically return to pre-injury functioning (assessed using symptom ratings or brief neuropsychological measures) within 2-14 days. Trauma patients usually take longer to return to their pre-injury functioning. In these patients recovery can be incomplete and can be complicated by preexisting psychiatric or substance abuse problems, poor general health, concurrent orthopedic injuries, or comorbid problems (e.g. chronic pain, depression, substance abuse, life stress, unemployment, and protracted litigation).",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of death and disability in young adults, with consequences ranging from physical disabilities to long-term cognitive, behavioural, psychological and social defects. Post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) was recognized more than 80 years ago, but it was thought to be a rare occurrence. Recently, clinical evidence has demonstrated that TBI may frequently cause hypothalamic–pituitary dysfunction, probably contributing to a delayed or hampered recovery from TBI. Changes in pituitary hormone secretion may be observed during the acute phase post-TBI, representing part of the acute adaptive response to the injury. Moreover, diminished pituitary hormone secretion, caused by damage to the pituitary and/or hypothalamus, may occur at any time after TBI. PTHP is observed in about 40% of patients with a history of TBI, presenting as an isolated deficiency in most cases, and more rarely as complete pituitary failure. The most common alterations appear to be gonadotropin and somatotropin deficiency, followed by corticotropin and thyrotropin deficiency. Hyper- or hypoprolactinemia may also be present. Diabetes insipidus may be frequent in the early, acute phase post-TBI, but it is rarely permanent. Severity of TBI seems to be an important risk factor for developing PTHP; however, PTHP can also manifest after mild TBI. Accurate evaluation and long-term follow-up of all TBI patients are necessary in order to detect the occurrence of PTHP, regardless of clinical evidence for pituitary dysfunction. In order to improve outcome and quality of life of TBI patients, an adequate replacement therapy is of paramount importance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a specific type of neurodegenerative process within the brain that can only be diagnosed by doing a brain autopsy after the affected person has died. There is much left to learn about CTE; however, scientists believe that those with chronic exposure to subconcussive injuries may be at risk. Although clinical criteria for diagnosing CTE before brain autopsy have not yet been officially accepted, researchers are actively trying to understand what types of symptoms and difficulties individuals with CTE pathology might have experienced before their death. Commonly reported symptoms include changes in thinking abilities and mood, though these symptoms are common in many conditions. Other neurodegenerative conditions that have been reported as associated with head injury include Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Any athlete who is worried or concerned about the cumulative effects of multiple concussions, exposure to subconcussive injury, or CTE or other neurodegeneration should ask their health care provider for a multidisciplinary referral to include neurological and neuropsychological evaluation. Regardless of the cause of symptoms, health care providers can help patients feel better and better manage their symptoms. Patients may experience persisting symptoms after concussion, or they may have other medical or neurological conditions that are treatable. Receiving appropriate evaluations and effective treatments for specific symptoms will significantly improve patients’ daily functioning and quality of life.",

Convergence problems include the more commonly seen primary convergence accommodative synkenesis insufficiency and excess, but as well, result from destabilizing vergence disorders of convergence retraction nystagmus and convergence spasm. Convergence effort alone rarely can induce other forms of nystagmus at near. Saccadic dysfunction occurs in a large variety of muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Accommodative insufficiency can result from head trauma, mononeuropathy affecting the third cranial nerve and cilliary ganglion, destructive intraocular disease as well as from systemic diseases such as botulism and diphtheria. Drugs can affect any of the near vision factors in dose related fashion. A complete history is paramount in reaching the correct diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for various cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, including attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and interpersonal interactions. Sleep disruptions undermine these functions, resulting in measurable impairments in daily activities, occupational performance, and public safety. Adequate sleep supports sustained vigilance and concentration, whereas sleep deprivation is associated with attentional lapses, diminished cognitive control, and impaired sensory processing. Memory consolidation, which depends on both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is particularly susceptible to disruption by sleep loss. Executive functions, such as working memory, impulse control, and decision-making, are notably impaired due to the prefrontal cortex's heightened sensitivity to insufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation increases amygdala reactivity, weakens prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, and contributes to emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Chronic sleep deprivation exacerbates cognitive deficits, emotional instability, and motor performance decline, leading to higher error rates and reduced workplace productivity. Given its widespread consequences, chronic sleep deprivation constitutes a significant public health concern. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary research on the effects of sleep and sleep loss on waking behavior, with a focus on attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and daytime performance.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "title": "Neuroprotective gene therapy strategies applied to the acutely damaged immature rat brain",
      "abstract": "Un dano agudo al sistema nervioso central (SNC) desencadena una serie de eventos complejos e interrelacionados, entre los cuales encontramos tres especialmente importantes: excitotoxicidad, estres oxidativo e inflamacion. En particular, el cerebro inmaduro muestra varias caracteristicas que lo hacen especial en cuanto a sus reacciones frente a lesioned agudas. En este contexto, la presente Tesis contribuye al conocimiento basico de los procesos de estres oxidativo e inflamacion que ocurren luego de una lesion excitotoxica mediada por inyeccion de NMDA en el cerebro inmaduro. Asimismo, desarrolla estrategias neuroprotectoras mediante la utilizacion de nuevos vectores de terapia genica combinados con la sobreexpresion de enzimas antioxidantes.\nEsta Tesis muestra que la expresion de una de las enzimas antioxidantes mas importantes, la Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), en el cerebro inmaduro normal se observa principalmente en neuronas, pero tambien en la glia limitans y la pared de los ventriculos cerebrales. Sin embrago, 4 horas despues de una lesion excitotoxica, la enzima muestra una importante reduccion en las neuronas afectadas por la lesion aguda inicial, ocurriendo esto antes de que estas neuronas iniciaran un proceso de muerte neuronal. A partir del primer dia postlesion la expresion de SOD comienza a aumentar en astrocitos reactivos. La nitrotirosina, un producto del peroxinitrito, en el cerebro inmaduro luego de la lesion mostro un incremento en neuronas del nucleo de la lesion, y al dia 1 postlesion tambien se observo en astocitos. Es interesante destacar que los astrocitos nitrados a partir de los 3 dias postlesion delimitaban una subpoblacion celular mostrando como caracteristicas principales un alto grado de hipertrofia, elevados niveles de GFAP, expresion de novo de vimentina y SOD, y expresando metalotiooneina I/II, siendo siempre los astrocitos mas reactivos. Asimismo, a pesar de encontrarse altamente nitrados y expresar la caspasa 3 activa en su nucleo, estos astrocitos no mostraron ningun signo morfologico de muerte celular ni tincion para TUNEL, lo cual sugiere que estas celulas no mueren al menos hasta los 7 dias postlesion.\nEsta Tesis se centro seguidamente en el desarrollo de nuevas estrategias de terapia genica basadas en vectores proteicos modulares recombinantes. Cuando estos vectores fueron inyectados intracerebralmente 4 horas luego de la lesion, fueron capaces de transfectar celulas en toda la zona lesionada del cerebro inmaduro. Asimismo, fueron capaces de transfectar tanto neuronas como astrocitos y microglia, sin generar inflamacion adicional. Con estos resultados prometedores, una de estos vectores se utilizo para sobreexpresar la SOD 2 horas luego de la lesion. Esta sobreexpresion indujo una disminucion en los niveles de nitrotirosina, una disminucion en el volumen de lesion, un aumento en la supervivencia neuronal, y una recuperacion funcional significativa cuando se compararon con animales lesionados e inyectados con solucion salina control. Sorprendentemente, esta Tesis muestra que estos vectores poseen un potencial neuroprotector endogeno, que es mediado por sus dominios de interaccion con integrinas Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), ya que la inyeccion in vivo de un pequeno peptido ciclico con la secuencia RGD tambien resulto neuroprotector a niveles similares. En cultivos celulares mixtos de corteza cerebral, tanto los vectores como el peptido RGD fueron protectores frente a un dano inducido por NMDA, pero no lo fueron en cultivos purificados de neuronas corticales, sugiriendo que el efecto neuroprotector es dependiente de celulas gliales.\nEsta Tesis concluye que el estres oxidativo, y en particular la via del superoxido/peroxinitrito, contribuyen de manera fundamental al desarrollo de una lesion aguda en el cerebro inmaduro. Asimismo, la sobreepresion de SOD puede ser una interesante estrategia neuroprotectora. Finalmente, concluye que los vectores proteicos recombinantes modulares pueden actuar eficientemente in vivo luego de una lesion aguda al cerebro inmaduro, produciendo niveles terapeuticos de proteinas neuroprotectoras.\n_______________________________________________________________\nAcute central nervous system (CNS) damage consists of a multitude of inter-related and complex events, playing excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation important roles in the initial and secondary injury. In particular, the immature brain displays several characteristics that make it special in its reactions against acute injuries. In this context, this Thesis contributes to the basic understanding of the oxidative stress and inflammation occurring after an NMDA-mediated excitotoxic lesion to the immature brain, and to the development of neuroprotective gene therapy strategies for reducing immature brain damage by inhibiting oxidative stress.\nThis Thesis shows the in vivo expression and cell localization of one of the most important antioxidant proteins, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), whose expression was observed mainly in neuronal cells, glia limitans and ependyma in the normal immature brain. However, after an excitotoxic lesion, the expression of this enzyme rapidly disappeared (at 4 hours) from the acutely affected neurons before they underwent cell death. One day after, expression of SOD begun to increase in reactive astrocytes, present in the lesion for up to 7 days, the last time studied. Moreover, in the normal brain, the peroxynitrite product nitrotyrosine was observed in neurons and scattered astrocytes, however, after the excitotoxic lesion it was early increased in neurons of the lesion core, and after at 1 day post-lesion it increased also in astrocytes. Interestingly, the nitrated hypertrophied astrocytes from 3 days post-lesion onward represented a separated population of cells sharing several markers such as vimentin, metallothionein, SOD, and high GFAP content and hypertrophy, being always phenotypically the most reactive astrocytes. In addition, although being heavily nitrated and showing activated caspase 3 in their nuclei, nitrated astrocytes did not display any morphological sign of cell death nor TUNEL staining at any time-point studied.\nThe next step of this Thesis was to explore the putative beneficial effects of the overexpression of SOD after the NMDA excitotoxic lesion. This Thesis focused on the development of a new gene therapy strategy based on a non-viral modular recombinant protein vector. These vectors could deliver a transgene to the whole excitotoxically lesioned zone of the immature brain when injected 4 hours after the lesion. Moreover, they could transfect neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells, without generating additional inflammation. With these promising results, one of these protein vectors was used for overexpressing SOD 2 hours after the excitotoxic lesion. SOD overexpressing animals displayed decreased nitrotyrosine formation, reduced lesion volume, increased neuronal survival, and a complete functional recovery after 3 days in relation to NMDA+saline injected animals. Surprisingly control lesioned animals injected with the protein vector overexpressing the transgene for the green fluorescent protein or with the naked protein vector without any DNA, showed also a reduced lesion volume. Finally this Thesis showed that the neuroprotective potential of the protein vectors was mediated by the vectors integrin-interacting Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, as a cyclic RGD peptide was sufficient to induce this neuroprotection. Accordingly, both the protein vector and the cyclic RGD peptide were neuroprotective against a NMDA mediated injury to mixed cortical cultures. However, none of these molecules were neuroprotective under the same treatment conditions in cortical neuron purified cultures, suggesting that the neuroprotective mechanisms include triggering of a glial derived neurotrophic phenotype.\nThis Thesis concludes that oxidative stress, and in particular the O2-./ONOO- pathway is a mayor contributor to lesion expansion in the acutely injured immature brain, and that the overexpression of SOD is an interesting neuroprotective strategy. In addition, it shows that modular recombinant protein vectors are efficient gene therapy vectors that can be applied to therapeutic interventions to the acutely lesioned immature brain.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow sleep (CSWS),which is one of the hallmarks of electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep (ESES), is a functional disorder with the following features: severe paroxysmal EEG disturbance; seizures that may be severe but self-limited; behavioral deterioration, with or without premorbid developmental disturbances; no demonstrable brain pathology sufficient to explain the behavioral deterioration; and stabilization or improvement of behavior once the epileptiform EEG abnormalities resolve [1]. Much serious in CSWS are cognitive and behavioral disturbances. In CSWS, paroxysmal activity permanently affects the frontal lobes and higher cognitive functions. At highest risk for permanent sequelae are those with the earliest and longest exposure to the active phase of CSWS. When and how should CSWS be treated?",

      "title": "Functional Differentiation of Multiple Perilesional Zones after Focal Cerebral Ischemia",
      "abstract": "Transient and permanent focal cerebral ischemia results in a series of typical pathophysiologic events. These consequences evolve in time and space and are not limited to the lesion itself, but they can be observed in perilesional (penumbra) and widespread ipsi- and sometimes contralateral remote areas (diaschisis). The extent of these areas is variable depending on factors such as the type of ischemia, the model, and the functional modality investigated. This review describes some typical alterations attributable to focal cerebral ischemia using the following classification scheme to separate different lesioned and perilesional areas: (1) The lesion core is the brain area with irreversible ischemic damage. (2) The penumbra is a brain region that suffers from ischemia, but in which the ischemic damage is potentially, or at least partially, reversible. (3) Remote brain areas are brain areas that are not directly affected by ischemia. With respect to the etiology, several broad categories of remote changes may be differentiated: (3a) remote changes caused by brain edema; (3b) remote changes caused by waves of spreading depression; (3c) remote changes in projection areas; and (3d) remote changes because of reactive plasticity and systemic effects. The various perilesional areas are not necessarily homogeneous; but a broad differentiation of separate topographic perilesional areas according to their functional state and sequelae allows segregation into several signaling cascades, and may help to understand the functional consequences and adaptive processes after focal brain ischemia.",

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is now considered an abnormal physiology in the optic nerve head that interacts with the level of intraocular pressure (IOP), with the degree and rate of damage depending on the IOP and presumably the degree of abnormal physiology. Diagnosis of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), defined as glaucoma without a clearly abnormal IOP, depends on recognizing symptoms and signs associated with optic nerve vulnerability, in addition to absence of other explanations for disc abnormality and visual field loss. Among the findings are a halo or crescent of absence of retinal pigment epithelium around the disc, bilateral pre-chiasmal visual field defects, splinter hemorrhages at the disc margin, vascular dysregulation (low blood pressure, cold hands and feet, migraine headache with aura, and the like), or a family history of glaucoma. Possibly relevant, is a history of hemodynamic crisis, arterial obstructive disease, or sleep apnea. Neurological evaluation with imaging is needed only for atypical cases or ones that progress unexpectedly. Management follows the same principle of other chronic glaucomas, to lower the IOP by a substantial amount, enough to prevent disabling visual loss. However, many NTG cases are non-progressive. Therefore, it may often be wise in mild cases to determine whether the case is progressive and the rate of progression before deciding on how aggressivene to be with therapy. Efforts at neuroprotection and improvement in blood flow have not yet been shown effective.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Conversion disorder has one or more symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory function suggesting a neurological or other medical condition, but they are inconsistent with known neurological or musculoskeletal pathologies. Individuals with conversion disorder do not intentionally produce or feign their symptoms. Instead, the symptoms are due to an unconscious expression of a psychological conflict or need. There might be associated primary and secondary gains which act as maintaining factors. The disorder is more common in adolescence than in childhood. CASE REPORT: A 17 years old male reported to the Emergency Department alleged history of fall from a 10 feet wall c/o neck pain, inability to move all 4 limbs, diminished sensation below the neck. Cervical immobilization was done and his vitals & routine blood investigations were found to be normal. No signs of any urinary retention or fecal incontinence. Routine neurological examination was performed which revealed hypotonia in all 4 limbs with flaccidity with a power of 0/5 and diminished sensation at the level of C3. Neuro imaging was done. MRI brain with cervical screening revealed no edema, cord compression. MRI CERVICAL SPINE – NORMAL. Stressor: He was convicted under POSCO act for 3 years, 2 days before the incident. Neurosurgeon ruled out the physical cause of the above presentation. Detailed history revealed he was being convicted for 3 years for a marrying a 17 years old girl with her consent under POSCO act 2 days prior to the incident. He was seen distressed after hearing the verdict, had sleep disturbances, remained aloof, not communicating with others. He attempted suicide by jumping from the wall. He had a history of occasional cannabis use for the past 2 years. Family history revealing possession attacks in his mother. He was raised by a single parent as his father left him and his mother when he was 5 years old. He had no episodes of similar illness in the past. His temperament revealed that he had difficulty in adjustment to the situations being impulsive and had self-injurious behavior. Mental status examination revealed that the patient was lying in supine position, not able to move his all 4 limbs with obvious psychomotor retardation decreased talks, sad mood. DISCUSSION: The clinical picture is indicative of Dissociative Motor Disorder F44.4 according to ICD 10. After taking a detailed history, it was clear that he was extremely distressed regarding his punishment under POSCO act as he willfully married a 17 years old girl with her consent which could not stand in the court of law. Patient was started on therapy sessions as well as low-dose diazepam. In the sessions, possible causes of these symptoms were discussed, his family members were also psycho-educated about the psychosomatic nature of the symptoms and advised to encourage him for a symptom-free lifestyle. They were also given an instruction not to pay attention to his complaints of physical nature. Psychotherapy sessions were started in which all her stressors were therapy discussed. CONCLUSION: Conversion disorder, somatoform disorder, and malingering always remain a diagnostic challenge for the clinicians. The prompt history taking, identification of stressors, use of appropriate and validated physical examination manoeuvres, and coordination of care and information exchange between all family members and medical team may facilitate the expeditious care of these patients in a cost-effective manner. Psychogenic symptoms should be treated using suggestions, patience, and reassurance. Early recognition of a conversion disorder will limit unnecessary tests and medications. The quality of doctor-patient relationship can influence outcome. The existing literature supports a multidisciplinary treatment approach, with specific interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy for cognitive restructuring and psychodynamic therapy for addressing symptom connections to trauma and dissociation.",

The symptom complex which usually appears subsequent to head trauma has become very familiar during the past few years. The resemblance from case to case of certain sequelae to head injuries has been grouped together in syndromes, variously labelled post-concussive syndrome, post-traumatic personality change, post-traumatic neurosis and post-contusional state, all indicating an oft-recurring persistent disability following concussion of the brain.",

      "abstract": "References 316Many of the distinctions among the illnesses that cause the syndrome of dementia become blurred or disappear in advanced or late stage dementia for several reasons. First, neuropathological abnormalities become so widespread that almost all brain systems that subserve cognition and function become impaired. A second and related issue is that the widespread involvement of subcortical or 'downstream' structures and systems results in widespread and near total dysfunction of 'upstream' cognitive and motor systems that are not directly involved by neuropathology. Thus, this chapter will approach late stage or advanced dementia as a single or common end point of all the dementias even though some distinctions, for example the frequency of myoclonus and seizures, do persist. Thus, while knowledge of the unique aspects of specific diseases plays a prominent role in the care of people with dementia in the earlier stages of the dementia, this is usually not the case in late-stage dementia (Robinson et al., 2006).",

      "abstract": "As defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is recognized not only as a sensory experience but also as a phenomenon with affective and cognitive responses. An important aspect of pain is nociception, a complex series of electrochemical events that involves activation of specialized neural pathways in response to (potentially) tissue-damaging stimuli. Clinically, the degree of nociception is manifested as signs of tissue damage. Pain, in contrast to nociception, is a subjective experience that may involve stimulus-induced activation of afferent neural pathways or other components, such as somatosensory processing or psychosocial factors. Reflex responses to nociceptive stimulation can be described as suprasegmental or cortical and spinal or segmental. Spinal reflexes are generated by nociceptive signals being transmitted through the dorsal horn to somatomotor or autonomic neurons at various spinal levels, resulting in responses such as paralytic ileus, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, or muscle spasm. Suprasegmental reflexes are propagated via the ascending pathways to the brain stem, hypothalamus, and cortex, where withdrawal reflexes and autonomic responses are generated.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a common complication and one of the most difficult complications of spinal cord injury and has serious consequences for patients. Pain has long-term negative effects on the quality of life of patients. Chronic spinal cord injury-related pain also is related to functional disability. It can significantly impair sleep, mood, and mental health. Neuropathic pain accounts for a significant percentage of all pain symptoms in patients with spinal cord injuries and is often complex. Injury or damage to peripheral tissues induces activation of free nerve endings, leading to the perception of neurogenic pain. In contrast, neuropathic pain is perceived due to abnormal functioning within nerve cells at a certain level of the neuraxis. In neuropathic pain, differentiation may be established between abnormal peripheral function, e.g., neuralgia after peripheral nerve injury of postherpetic neuralgia, where abnormal firing may occur in dorsal root ganglion cells, and central neuropathic pain, in which the pain generator is considered to be within the brain and spinal cord. A central phenomenon in neuropathic pain is ectopic and inappropriate generation of nociceptive information in the central mechanism of pain perception, although the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear.",

It is well known that patients with depression often have deficits in verbal and visual memory, verbal fluency, attention and short-term memory. Some of these deficits have also been reported to be maintained beyond acute phases, during clinical remission and euthymia. Aims: To review current literature on cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder and its therapeutic approach.Methods: Non-systematic review of the literature available in the PubMed database using the keywords “depression”, “major depressive disorder”, “cognitive impairment”, “cognitive function”, “cognition”.Results and Conclusions: In some studies cognitive deficits in depression have been related with the use of antidepressant drugs. However, similar deficits were found in non-medicated patients who maintain residual cognitive deficits, even after adequate treatment and achievement of euthymia, with significant functional impairment. Variable patterns of cognitive deficits are found in patients receiving different antidepressants, when in remission of depressive episodes and without medication. The mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder are not fully understood, but undoubtedly significantly impact patients’ lives. New therapeutic approaches towards cognitive complaints have been applied in these patients, such as cognitive remediation, previously used in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Disautonomia: Uma Condição Esquecida – Parte 1",
      "abstract": "Dysautonomia covers a range of clinical conditions with different characteristics and prognoses. They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH). OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases. Preventive measures such as postural care; good hydration; higher salt intake; use of compression stockings and abdominal straps; portioned meals; supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months; 2 - Feeling ill after exercising; 3 - Non-restorative sleep; 4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm if <20 years) or HR ≥120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common.O termo disautonomia abrange um conjunto de condições clínicas com características e prognósticos distintos. Classificam-se em síndromes reflexas, síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), síndrome da fadiga crônica, Hipotensão Ortostática Neurogênica (HON) e a Síndrome da hipersensibilidade do seio carotídeo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) não serão discutidas neste artigo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) são, na maioria das vezes, benignas, e ocorrem usualmente em pacientes sem doença intrínseca do sistema nervoso autônomo (SNA) ou do coração. Por isso, geralmente são estudadas separadamente. O termo neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) é o mais utilizado na atualidade para definir as disautonomias com comprometimento do sistema nervoso autônomo cardiovascular simpático e/ou parassimpático. Pode ser idiopática, como a atrofia multissistêmica ou a falência autonômica pura, ou secundária a patologias sistêmicas como diabetes mellitus, doenças neurodegenerativas, doença de Parkinson, síndromes demenciais, insuficiência renal crônica, amiloidose, podendo também acometer idosos. A presença de neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) implica em maior gravidade e pior prognóstico em diversas situações clínicas. A detecção de hipotensão ortostática (HO) é um sinal tardio e significa maior gravidade no contexto das disautonomias, definida como hipotensão ortostática neurogênica (HON). Deve ser diferenciada das hipotensões por hipovolemia ou medicamentosas, chamadas de hipotensão ortostática não neurogênica (HONN). A HO pode decorrer de causas benignas, como a hipovolemia aguda, crônica, ou ao uso de diversos fármacos. Esses fármacos podem, entretanto, apenas desmascarar quadros subclínicos de disautonomia. Deve-se reavaliar todos os fármacos de pacientes com quadros disautonômicos. O diagnóstico preciso de NAC e a investigação do envolvimento de outros órgãos ou sistemas é de extrema importância na suspeita clínica de uma pandisautonomia. No diabético, além da idade e do tempo de doença, outros fatores estão associados a maior ocorrência de NAC, como descontrole glicêmico, hipertensão, dislipidemia e obesidade. Entre os pacientes diabéticos, 38–44% podem evoluir com disautonomia, com implicações prognósticas e maior mortalidade cardiovascular. Nas etapas iniciais da DM, a disfunção autonômica envolve o sistema parassimpático, posteriormente o simpático e mais tardiamente manifesta-se com hipotensão ortostática. Os testes de Valsalva, respiratório e ortostático (30:15) são os métodos de padrão ouro para o diagnóstico de NAC. Eles podem ser associados aos testes de variabilidade RR no domínio do tempo, e principalmente da frequência, para aumento da sensibilidade (protocolo dos 7 testes). Esses testes podem detectar alterações iniciais ou subclínicas e avaliar a gravidade e o prognóstico. O teste de inclinação (tilt test) não deve ser o exame de escolha para investigação de NAC em fase inicial, pois detecta casos em fases mais avançadas. A resposta no tilt com padrão disautonômico (queda gradativa da pressão arterial sem aumento da frequência cardíaca) pode sugerir NAC. O tratamento dos pacientes em fases moderadas a avançadas das disautonomias é bastante complexo e muitas vezes refratário, necessitando de avaliação especializada e multidisciplinar. Não há cura para a maioria das disautonomias em fase tardia. Os pacientes com HON podem evoluir com hipertensão supina em mais de 50% dos casos, representando um grande desafio terapêutico. O risco imediato e as consequências da HO devem ter preferência sobre os riscos mais tardios da hipertensão supina e valores maiores que 160/90 mmHg são toleráveis. Medidas como dormir com a cabeceira elevada (20–30 cm), não levantar à noite, uso de anti-hipertensivo de ação curta noturna para casos mais severos, como a losartana, captopril, clonidina ou adesivos de nitratos, podem ser necessários e efetivos em alguns casos. As medidas preventivas como cuidados posturais, boa hidratação, maior ingesta de sal, uso de meias e cintas abdominais compressoras, refeições fracionadas, atividade física supervisionada principalmente sentada, deitada ou exercícios na água são etapas importantes no tratamento. Diversos fármacos podem ser usados para HON sintomática, principalmente a fludrocortisona, a midodrina e a droxidopa. Esses últimas não estão disponíveis no Brasil. O risco de exacerbação ou desencadeamento de hipertensão supina deve ser considerado. A síndrome da fadiga crônica representa uma forma de disautonomia e tem sido renomeada como doença sistêmica de intolerância ao exercício, com novos critérios diagnósticos: 1 - Fadiga inexplicada, levando a incapacidade para o trabalho por mais que 6 meses; 2 - Mal-estar após exercício; 3 - Sono não reparador; 4 - Mais um dos seguintes achados: comprometimento cognitivo ou intolerância ortostática. Várias patologias na atualidade têm evoluído com fadiga crônica, sendo denominadas de doenças crônicas associadas a fadiga crônica. A síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), outra forma de apresentação das síndromes disautonômicas, é caracterizada por elevação sustentada da frequência cardíaca (FC) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm se <20 anos) ou FC ≥120 bpm, nos primeiros 10 minutos em posição ortostática ou durante o tilt test, sem hipotensão ortostática clássica associada. Pode ocorrer leve redução na pressão arterial. Os sintomas manifestam-se ou pioram em posição ortostática, sendo comuns a tontura, fraqueza, pré-síncope, palpitações, além de outros sintomas sistêmicos.",

      "abstract": "The criteria of brain death established by Japanese Society of EEG in 1974, necessitates a prerequisite; be applicable only to \"acute destructive, primary gross lesion of brain\". Namely, because of insufficient clinical data, secondary brain lesion such as post-anoxia, intoxication, metabolic coma and some kinds of CNS infection were excluded for the object to determine brain death. The criteria published by others also describe that etiology of coma should be clarified, and that careful measures are necessary to diagnose brain death if the cause of coma is unknown. In the present study, it was investigated that whether a clinico-pathological entity of brain death could exist universally regardless of the etiology, and by what means it could be defined clinically. The patients suffering from nondestructive, secondary brain lesions and who showed \"brain death-like state\" were selected for the study. (\"Brain death-like state\" requires coma, dilated nonreactive pupis and arrest of respiration concomitantly for more than 6 hours.) And 25 patients were collected, whose underlying diseases were post-anoxia or shock, CO intoxication, Paraquat poisoning, near-drowning or suffocation, hepatic coma, accidental hypothermia and sepsis, with or without the episode of cardiac arrest. Though all the patients died from 1 to 13 days after the insult, clinical signs of brain death-like state were not always irreversible. Isoelectric EEG was obtained on that state in 11 patients and repeated EEG revealed no return on those patients. But another 5 patients showed EEG activity when brain death was strongly suspected clinically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is defined as a painful condition caused by neurological lesions or diseases. Sometimes, neurological disorders may also be associated with neuropathic pain, which can be challenging to manage. For example, multiple sclerosis (MS) may cause chronic centralized painful symptoms due to nerve damage. Other chronic neuropathic pain syndromes may occur in the form of post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, and other central pain syndromes. Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with dysfunction, disability, depression, disturbed sleep, and reduced quality of life. Early diagnosis may help improve outcomes, and pain control can be an important factor in restoring function. There are more than 100 different types of peripheral neuropathy and those involving sensory neurons can provoke painful symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy is essential for pain control. Further examples are represented by gluten neuropathy, which is an extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity and presents as a form of peripheral neuropathy; in these unusual cases, neuropathy may be managed with diet. Neuropathic pain has been linked to CoronaVirus Disease (COVID) infection both during acute infection and as a post-viral syndrome known as long COVID. In this last case, neuropathic pain relates to the host's response to the virus. However, neuropathic pain may occur after any critical illness and has been observed as part of a syndrome following intensive care unit hospitalization.",

      "title": "Sports‐related peripheral nerve injuries of the upper limb",
      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral nerve injuries in athletes affect the upper limb more commonly than the lower limb. Common mechanisms include compression, traction, laceration, and ischemia. Specific sports can have unique mechanisms of injury and are more likely to be associated with certain neuropathies. Familiarity with these sport‐specific variables and recognition of the common presentations of upper limb neuropathic syndromes are important in assessing an athlete with a suspected peripheral nerve injury. Evaluation may require imaging modalities and/or electrodiagnostic testing to confirm a nerve injury. In some cases, diagnostic injections may be needed to differentiate neuropathic versus musculoskeletal etiology. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for treatment/management and increases the likelihood of a safe return‐to‐sport and avoidance of long‐term functional consequences. Most nerve injuries can be treated conservatively, however, severe or persistent cases may require surgical intervention. This monograph reviews key diagnostic, management, and preventative strategies for sports‐related peripheral nerve injuries involving the upper limb.",

Reports with direct bearing on possible mechanisms of local anesthetic neurotoxicity were included. <h3>Results.</h3> There is basic and clinical evidence that local anesthetics can cause nerve injury. Nerve injury may result from direct toxicity to the axon or Schwann cell, or may be secondary to disruption of the nerve microenvironment. Although each of these possibilities is supported by published experiments, injury to the axon is the most likely explanation for persistent neurologic deficits, such as those believed to result from clinical use of local anesthetics. Whether the injury is direct or indirect, and the precise mechanism by which it occurs, has received only limited study. <h3>Conclusions.</h3> In rare instances, the clinical use of local anesthetics is associated with neurologic morbidity. The physiologic mechanisms of toxicity for which there is the best evidence are inhibition of fast axonal transport, disruption of the axonal cytoskeleton, axonal degeneration, and ischemic nerve injury. The effects of local anesthetics on nerve blood flow may be related to inhibition of endothelium-dependent vasodilation or interruption of the synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins. Both the prevention and the treatment of nerve injury caused by local anesthetics requires information that is not yet available about the physiologic and molecular mechanisms for direct neural toxicity of local anesthetics.",

      "abstract": "The nature of concussion: a speculative hypothesis Concussion is one of the commonest forms of neurological injury seen throughout the world.Although common in sport, this condition has parallels in the types of injury suffered in motor vehicle crashes, falls, and other forms of brain trauma. 1 Despite the fact that the eVects of brain injuries have been recognised for at least 3000 years and the clinical state of concussion initially described over 1000 years ago, 2 the understanding of the pathophysiology of these injuries remains limited.One issue that remains difficult to reconcile is the absence of consistent neuroimaging abnormalities in the face of dramatic symptoms.This may in part be because concussion is due to a functional rather than structural lesion but also that the anatomical locus may be not cortical as is often assumed. Clinical featuresThe acute symptoms of concussion are described in detail in many published studies.4][5][6][7] The attentional deficit is often loosely described by clinicians as \"confusion\" or \"disorientation\".While these terms are often seen as sine qua non of concussion, it is more scientifically appropriate to use the correct terminology.Other recently documented clinical features of acute concussion include convulsive and motor phenomena. 8ost of these symptoms are protean and non-specific in terms of cerebral localisation.The only symptom complex that is more likely to represent cortical or subcortical dysfunction is memory disturbance.Traditional neurological thinking would suggest that the anatomical locus for such symptoms should be in the temporal lobes or orbitotemporal region.www.bjsportmed.com",

Orbital myositis implies orbital inflammation confined to one or more extraocular muscles and usually begins acutely with unilateral (peri)orbital pain, particularly on eye movement, and diplopia due to restriction of extraocular muscle movement. In addition, eyelid swelling and conjunctival injection may be present1. Due to these additional symptoms and due to the occurrence of pain, orbital myositis usually can be easily differentiated from nerve lesions as causes of diplopia. Here, we report a case with recurrent orbital myositis sequentially affecting solely the lateral rectus muscles. The first episode was misdiagnosed as abducens nerve palsy in the absence of pain or other additional symptoms of myositis.",

In relation to eye movement disorders the patients may be complaining of double vision, in which case they should be asked whether it is constant or intermittent; does it occur, or is it maximal, in certain directions of gaze; what is the relationship of one image with the other; and have they tried covering one eye and did that relieve the symptom? A less frequently reported symptom is oscillopsia, an illusion of movement of stationary objects, when enquiries need to be made whether the movement is horizontal or vertical, and does it become maximally apparent in certain positions of gaze, as for example in downbeat nystagmus when the oscillopsia is maximal on down gaze. Nystagmus will not be described here and has been covered in a previous article in Practical Neurology .1\n\nThe first part of any examination is observation and again this may provide clues to the diagnosis. Look out for abnormal head postures, turns or tilts, the latter typically occurring in an isolated trochlear nerve palsy; abnormal patterns of eye–head coordination, such as the head thrusts seen in ocular motor apraxia; abnormalities of the eyelids such as ptosis in an oculomotor palsy and myasthenia gravis, or retraction as is seen in thyroid ophthalmopathy and progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\nWe are now ready to examine the eye movements, hopefully with the benefit of some clues to the diagnosis already obtained from the history and simple observation of the patient.\n\n### Ocular misalignment\n\nFirst ask the patient to look at a distant object and observe any obvious ocular misalignment or abnormal, spontaneous eye movements.

      "abstract": "A spectrum of neuropathology occurs in infants who sustain traumatic brain injury. Because of a prolonged survival interval, there is a risk that these deaths may not be recognized as a sequel of trauma. We reviewed the records in New York City of 5 delayed fatalities due to nonaccidental infant head injury that had survival intervals from 2.5 to 17 years. The head injuries occurred at 2 to 3 months of age, and death occurred at 2.5 to 17 years of age. Initially, they were reported as natural deaths by treating physicians, families, and/or police. All 5 infants had unexplained or poorly explained remote traumatic head injury that included subdural hematomas. At autopsy, the neuropathologic exam demonstrated remote subdural hemorrhages and lesions related to chronic hypoxic-ischemic injury including atrophy, arterial infarcts, border-zone infarcts, and cystic encephalomalacia. Each child survived the initial injury but later succumbed to the delayed effects of secondary hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. These 5 deaths highlight the need to investigate independently the medical history of any child (or adult) who dies with a clinical diagnosis of “cerebral palsy.” The term cerebral palsy often is used as a catchall for any patient who has had neurologic impairment since infancy or childhood. If there is a direct link between the initial injury and the death, even if the injury occurred many years before death, then the injury is the proximate cause of death and dictates the manner of death. All 5 deaths were certified as homicides.",

First of all, the examiner must determine whether the abnormal function of eye muscles is the result of mechanical factors or caused by a disorder of innervation. Since purely mechanical impairment of ocular motility depends on local factors, such cases belong exclusively to the domain of ophthalmology and, therefore, are not discussed here. On the other hand neuroarenic disorders of eve movements rarely originate in the eye itself but are due to a lesion (or lesions) in the nervous system; consequently, a detailed neurologic examination becomes mandatory.It . . .",

      "abstract": "Children with epilepsy are at significant risk for cognitive impairment and behavioral abnormalities. In most children with epilepsy, the likely reason for cognitive impairment is the underlying pathology responsible for the seizures. However, there is considerable controversy about whether seizures per se can cause brain damage or increase subsequent susceptibility to seizure. Although some longitudinal studies have related a decline in intellectual abilities to continued seizures, other studies indicate that treatment with antiepileptic drugs or progression of the encephalopathic process is responsible for the decline. Both clinical and animal studies have focused on the long-term effects of seizures on the developing brain. Whereas prolonged seizures may cause permanent neurologic sequelae in the mature animal, the immature brain may be more resistant to the long-term sequelae of seizures.",

In brief, every patient who undergoes major surgery experiences an electrolyte disturbance that may cause a psychotic or delirious reaction.

      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures commonly arise from the mesial temporal lobe, and “scarring” of the hippocampus, hippocampal sclerosis, is the commonest cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Hippocampal sclerosis stems from genetic and environmental factors, including traumatic brain injury, prolonged seizures, or inflammation. The hippocampus is not only the origin of seizures but also susceptible to damage from them, which can result in disease progression. Epilepsy, the occurrence of spontaneous seizures, results from structural and functional changes in hippocampal networks. A host of different processes, including inflammation, neuronal death, and changes in gene expression, drive the network changes that eventually result in epilepsy. Targeting these processes may prevent epilepsy or its progression. While many of these changes may be compensatory in reducing seizure frequency, they can impact cognition and mental health. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the pathophysiology of epilepsy-related hippocampal sclerosis overlaps with other conditions such as Alzheimer’s and neuropsychiatric disease.",

      "title": "Experimental Concussion",
      "abstract": "The various hypotheses of the mechanism of coma resulting from cerebral trauma are discussed. Experimental evidence shows that there are two kinds of transient abolition of cerebral function by trauma—acceleration concussion, and compression concussion. The former is a passing paralysis which occurs in all brain-stem mechanisms examined and is brought about at and beyond a threshold value of change in velocity. A lesser degree of change causes momentary depression of function, a greater degree prolongs the phase of paralysis before recovery occurs. Movement of the head is necessary for the usual kind of concussion to occur, as also for contre-coup injury. Compression concussion has much more selective incidence on the respiratory centre, and appears to require an extreme crushing injury or penetration of the skull by a relatively large object. Acceleration concussion is that accompanying closed head injury and is not accompanied by any significant change in C.S.F. pressure. The cerebral blood flow is verv greatly increased in this variety owing to stimulation of the vagoglossopharyngeal nerves at the foramen magnum. With more severe blows subpial or intramedullary lesions may occur in this situation, indicating that distortion at the foramen magnum occurs. No evidence of vascular spasm or paralysis is found. An immediate brief rise of blood-pressure is due to stimulation of the vasomotor centre. Vagal effects may not appear until the traumatic paralysis of all centres begins to pass off. A delayed fall in blood-pressure lasting many minutes may follow severe vagal effects, and appears comparable to acute surgical shock as produced by intense stimulation of any other visceral nerve. Death occurs from failure of blood-pressure, an intensification of shock with shallow respiration and intense constriction of viscera. It is concluded that sudden failure of what has been called the veno-pressor system is important in death shortly following experimental concussion. No macroscopical lesions are found, and histological examination shows no change with ordinary tissue stains. The unconsciousness of coma is believed to be related to direct traumatic paralysis of the cortical neurones and if their sensitivity to physical violence is similar to that of anæsthetics, prolonged impairment of function from this cause alone is possible. Clinical observations were related in support of these conclusions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:The posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) presents as focal neurological symptoms associated with neuroimaging of brain edema, frequently evolving toward remission. It typically manifests as a transient episode of encephalopathy, seizures, and visual disturbances within specific patient populations. Originally described in patients with autoimmune conditions, it also occurs in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, possibly due to the effect of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs). [1] In these conditions, presumed damage to the blood-brain barrier results from endothelial dysfunction caused by exposure to the toxic effects of these agents, or is precipitated by cerebrovascular dysregulation following acute hypertension. [2]Common brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) patterns associated with PRES include vasogenic brain edema in the white matter, with a dominant parieto-occipital pattern, bilateral watershed pattern, or superior frontal sulcus pattern. However, atypical localizations such as frontal, temporal, basal ganglia, brainstem, or cerebellar involvement can also occur. Recently, a bilateral occurrence of basal vasogenic brain edema outlining the lentiform nucleus, known as the 'lentiform fork sign' (typically described as a reliable sign of uremic encephalopathy), has been identified in patients experiencing PRES without metabolic disturbances. [4-7]In this report, we present a case of a recent bilateral lung and liver transplant recipient with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis who experienced his first-ever seizure episode, reflecting PRES with an atypical neuroimaging pattern, including the lentiform fork sign.",

Fast conjugate refixation movements are generated by the saccadic system, steady viewing and smooth tracking by the pursuit and optokinetic systems, and the vergence system maintains alignment for objects moving towards or away from the observer. The vestibular ocular system removes the potentially destabilizing effects of head movement by producing eye movements that are equal and opposite to the head movement, providing a stable setting for the other eye movement systems to operate. Isolated supranuclear motility disorders result in palsies of conjugate movement affecting one or more of the movement systems (so-called 'gaze palsies') in which diplopia is absent as parallelism of the visual axes is maintained. A dysconjugate gaze palsy results from a disruption of premotor or internuclear connections to the ocular motor nuclei, leading to a bilateral asymmetrical or unilateral limitation of movement.",

      "abstract": "The onset and reversibility of major depression is likely to be explained by diffuse neuromodulatory mechanisms rather than permanent abnormalities of connectivity and neurotransmission. However, the expression of mood state appears to involve fronto-striatal mechanisms. Lesions of the ventral frontal cortex give rise to profound modification of affect and behaviour not explained by effects on current intellectual function. These may represent the most extreme possible disturbances of emotional experience. Neuropsychological testing in major depression shows evidence of slowing in motor and cognitive domains with additional prominent effects on mnemonic function most marked in the elderly. Structural imaging with X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in older patients with major depression shows evidence of structural abnormality compared with controls. These findings are not highly localizing but they tend to confirm the role of cognitive impairment as an important age-related risk factor for major depression. Perfusion or metabolic imaging reflects both reversible changes in function and permanent loss of active neurones. The usual finding has been reductions in anterior brain structures in major depression. Hypoperfusion tends to be greatest in frontal, temporal and parietal areas and most extensive in older (male) patients; high Hamilton scores tend to be associated with reduced uptake. There have also been correlations in the cingulate cortex between increased perfusion and other aspects of the mental state. In general, reductions in frontal areas may be more likely in patients with impoverished mental states. The more prominent impairments of memory are likely to be associated with the finding of impaired temporal function or with a more diffuse failure of neuromodulation.",

      "abstract": "All memory disturbances, especially those developing suddenly, cause anxiety of the patient. Transient global amnesia is a form of amnesia of interest in many aspects. The amnesia was described in 1964 by Fisher and Adams, and as yet about 1000 cases have been reported. Middle aged or elderly patients prevail. The attack of amnesia lasts from several to about 20 hours and begins suddenly being regarded as mental confusion. The amnesia covers recent and remote events in many years. During the attack the patient is not appearing to be ill, but is depressed not knowing what has happened. The awareness of own personality, the ability to solve logical problems and visuospatial functions are preserved. The ability to execute complex activities, e.g. car driving, is normal. The aetiology of the disorder is completely unknown. The hypotheses for explaining the syndrome are: 1. ischaemia in the posterior cerebral arteries region with transient fall of blood supply through the vertebrobasilar system, 2. epilepsy or migraine, 3. disturbed aggregation of platelets in the cerebral vessels leading to loss of vessel patency. The first hypothesis seems least plausible. Attacks of this amnesia were noted after triazolam, after thalamic infarction and cerebral angiography, in brain tumours, hydrocephalus, scleroderma, frontal lobe haemorrhage. After an attack the events occurring in it are not remembered. Recurrence of attacks is very rare. Most authors consider that the disorder is benign and regresses without sequelae or only with slight changes in cognitive functions and memory fixation.",

      "title": "Spastic Hypertonia and Movement Disorders: Pathophysiology, Clinical Presentation, and Quantification",
      "abstract": "A delayed consequence of a lesion affecting the upper motor neuron pathways is the appearance of some forms of motor overactivity, including spasticity. Many of these are caused by hyperexcitability of spinal reflexes, such as stretch reflexes (spasticity, tendon hyperreflexia) or flexor withdrawal reflexes (flexor spasms), and are elicited at rest by sensory stimulation. Spastic co‐contraction is probably attributable to failure of reciprocal inhibition; it occurs only during active voluntary movement and constrains such movement. The basic underlying mechanism of these changes is not clear, although a change in the balance between the inhibitory and excitatory supraspinal upper motor neuron pathways toward net excitation most likely contributes. Increased intrinsic excitability of the alpha motor neurons is another possible factor. Spastic dystonia is most often seen as the presence of tonic muscle contraction in the absence of voluntary movement or spinal reflex activation, and the underlying mechanisms are obscure. Prolonged shortening of tissues, either because of weakness or muscle contraction, leads to stiffness of the soft tissues, which contributes to hypertonia and is thus self‐perpetuating, and ultimately to contracture with fixed shortening. Some of these forms of motor overactivity produce involuntary movements (hyperkinetic), eg, flexor spasms, whereas others impair movement (hypokinetic), either voluntary movement, eg, spastic co‐contraction, or passive movement, eg, spasticity. Quantification has mostly focused on hypertonia, that is, increased resistance at rest to passive movement. In the upper motor neuron syndrome, hypertonia could be caused by a combination of spasticity, spastic dystonia, and soft tissue stiffness (rheologic changes). Some measures, such as the Ashworth or Modified Ashworth Scales, quantify hypertonia but are very poor at distinguishing between spasticity and soft tissue stiffness. Another, the Tardieu Scale, is better at making this distinction, but quantification of the spasticity portion of hypertonia remains difficult, at least in a clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is amongst the oldest of diseases known to mankind. Migraine is a heterogenous entity, usually characterised by periodic attacks of headache on one or both sides of the head. These may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), increased sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), dizziness, blurred vision, cognitive disturbances, and other symptoms. Migraines are not always preceded by an aura and some migraines may not include headache. If migraine does not manifest itself in the form of headache but in some other form such as paroxysmal episodes of prolonged visual auras, atypical sensory, motor, or visual aura, confusion, dysarthria, focal neurologic deficits with or without a headache, it is labelled a Migraine Variant (MV). MV is therefore diagnosed by the history of paroxysmal symptoms with or without cephalgia and a prior history of migraine with aura, in the absence of other medical disorders that may contribute to the symptoms. Many of the MVs have been included and redefined in the revised edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) 2004 classification. These include hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine, childhood periodic syndromes, retinal migraine, complicated migraine and ophthalmoplegic migraine. Even though conditions such as vertiginous migraine, acute confusional migraine of childhood and nocturnal migraine are well recognized entities, they have not yet been included in IHCD-II, but will be discussed here in brief because they are relatively common conditions.",

Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja.

Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": ": After completing this article, readers should be able to:Neonatal seizures often are a manifestation of significant neurologic disease and a major predictor of adverse neurologic outcome in the newborn. The clinical features and electroencephalographic (EEG)characteristics of neonatal seizures differ considerably from those associated with epilepsy in older infants and children, an observation that reflects the immature stage of development of the newborn brain. Another major difference relates to the fact that neonatal seizures rarely are idiopathic. Prompt diagnosis,investigation to establish the underlying etiology, and rapid intervention are essential to minimize the possibility of associated cardiorespiratory instability and to correct treatable causes. Furthermore, experimental data suggest that ongoing or prolonged seizures may cause additional cerebral injury and have detrimental long-term effects.A seizure is defined generally as an excessive, synchronous electrical discharge (ie, depolarization of neurons in the brain). However, this definition may be too restrictive when applied to seizures in the newborn. Neonatal seizures may be defined more aptly as paroxysmal alterations in neurologic function(eg, behavioral, motor, or autonomic function). This definition encompasses both clinical phenomena that correlate temporally with epileptiform EEG abnormalities and stereotypical, paroxysmal clinical activities that are not associated clearly with EEG alterations.The reported incidence of neonatal seizures varies widely. Based on clinical observation, they are thought to occur in approximately 0.5% of term newborns and 20% of preterm newborns. However, long-term EEG recordings in pharmacologically paralyzed term newborns suggest that the incidence may be as high as 40% in some high-risk populations.A detailed discussion of the physiologic and metabolic mechanisms underlying neonatal seizures is beyond the scope of this article. However, several concepts that have important clinical implications deserve amplification. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures or an orderly progression of seizures is uncommon in the newborn because of the immature organization of the cerebral cortex and incomplete myelination of the interhemispheric connections. In contrast, oral-buccal-lingual movements, oculomotor disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction are frequent clinical manifestations and are considered to reflect the relatively more advanced development of brainstem and diencephalon in this age group. Alternatively, the observed lack of correlation of clinical events with epileptiform activity recorded by surface EEG has raised the speculation that some of these clinical events represent “brainstem release phenomena” rather than true epileptic seizures (ie, primitive brainstem and spinal motor patterns that are dissociated from normal cortical inhibition).In addition to the interest surrounding the origins of “seizure-like activity” in the newborn (which may determine whether treatment with conventional anticonvulsant medications is used), the physiologic and metabolic consequences of neonatal seizures are of major clinical significance. These include interference with respiration, alterations in blood pressure, and cerebral perfusion(even in the absence of abnormal motor activity), which in turn may exacerbate hemorrhagic or ischemic brain injury. In addition,experimental data suggest that ongoing neonatal seizures may deplete cerebral glucose levels and impair synthesis of cerebral DNA and proteins,which could contribute to the extent of cerebral injury.Neonatal seizures rarely are idiopathic, and immediate attention should be focused on identifying an underlying etiology to permit appropriate intervention and to enable accurate decisions regarding prognosis. Although there are numerous possible underlying etiologies of neonatal seizures, a relatively small number account for the majority of cases (Table 1). The time of onset and characteristics of neonatal seizures may suggest the most probable cause (Table 2). Clearly, a number of concomitant etiologic factors may be operative in the same infant. For example, hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia may occur as a result of catabolic stress in certain situations,such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or meningitis.Moderate or severe acute hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy accounts for approximately two thirds of all cases of neonatal seizures. Such seizures may be of any type, usually begin at any time during the first 24 hours of life, and frequently are difficult to control effectively with anticonvulsant medications. Often there are associated abnormalities of brainstem responses and muscle tone. Hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury sustained earlier during gestation may be asymptomatic in the newborn period. Consistently unilateral, focal seizures often are indicative of localized brain lesions,especially focal cerebral infarction. However, focal or multifocal seizures in the newborn also may occur in the context of diffuse cerebral injury.The most common metabolic disturbances associated with seizures are hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and derangements of serum sodium levels. Early hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia occur most commonly following gestational diabetes and in infants who are preterm, small for gestational age, or both. Hypo- or hypernatremia may result from dehydration, inappropriate fluid administration, or inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Rarely, inborn errors of metabolism present with seizures and an evolving, catastrophic neurologic and systemic deterioration, usually after several days of age. Pyridoxine dependency is a rare, autosomal recessive cause of neonatal or even intrauterine seizures that can be excluded based only on the response to several weeks of treatment with pyridoxine. The response to intravenous pyridoxine during EEG monitoring no longer is considered to be diagnostic of this disorder. Accordingly, it has been recommended that all newborns who have seizures of unknown etiology receive a trial of oral pyridoxine.In infants who have intracranial bacterial infection, seizures often begin during the latter part of the first week of life, usually in the context of systemic sepsis. The time of onset of seizures following congenital viral infection varies.Seizures associated with intracranial hemorrhage vary considerably,depending on the type of hemorrhage. Germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage, which occurs most commonly in the preterm newborn, may present with tonic seizures. Seizures associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage usually begin during the first day of life in term newborns. Characteristically,infants appear healthy between seizures, and the long-term prognosis is good. Subdural hemorrhage or cerebral contusion often presents with focal or subtle seizures of early onset.Seizures associated with cerebral dysgenesis or genetic syndromes have variable onset. Dysmorphic features, microcephaly, or cutaneous lesions may suggest these diagnoses.Infants who are exposed prenatally to alcohol and heroin rarely present with seizures. However, tremors and irritability, which may be mistaken for seizures, are a common manifestation. Seizures may occur in the context of withdrawal from cocaine or short-acting barbiturates. In addition, focal seizures may occur in association with cerebral infarction following prenatal exposure to cocaine. Rarely, inadvertant injection of a local anesthetic agent into the fetal scalp during delivery may result in transient seizures during the first hours of life.The most common neonatal epilepsy syndrome is autosomal dominant benign familial neonatal seizures,which usually begin on the third day of life and resolve after several months. In contrast, early myoclonic epileptic encephalopathy and Ohtahara syndrome are associated with progressive neurologic deterioration.In most instances, neonatal seizures are identified by clinical observation. Any unusual repetitive and stereotypic event may represent a clinical seizure. The relationship between such abnormal movements and abnormal electrical/epileptiform activity on EEG may be inconsistent. Furthermore, neonatal seizures must be distinguished from nonepileptic movements, which may mimic seizures. A clinical classification of neonatal seizures is summarized in Table 3. It is important to remember that seizures may manifest as isolated alterations in autonomic function, especially abnormal heart rate or change in blood pressure or oxygenation. Apnea alone rarely represents a seizure unless it occurs in the context of other clinical seizure activity.Several common movement disorders may be mistaken for seizures in the newborn (Table 4). Accurate diagnosis of nonepileptic movements is important to avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsant medications and to permit more accurate prediction of outcome.Because neonatal seizures rarely are idiopathic, immediate attention must be directed toward identifying an underlying etiology. Clearly, a detailed history, especially about maternal risk factors and complications of pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and physical examination are of paramount importance. In addition,initial screening investigations that should be considered include measurement of serum glucose, calcium,magnesium, pH, sodium bicarbonate,sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and ammonia. Lumbar puncture should be performed to determine the presence of infection or intracranial hemorrhage. If these investigations fail to identify a specific etiology,additional studies may include neuroimaging; measurement of serum amino acids, lactate, and urine organic acids; investigation for congenital viral infections; chromosome karyotype; and toxic drug screen. Assessment of other organ systems(eg, renal, hematologic, hepatic)may support a diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or an inborn error of metabolism.Confirmation of neonatal seizures often depends on the use of EEG,especially in infants who are paralyzed pharmacologically. Although routine interictal EEG is a noninvasive and portable procedure,interpretation of the findings in this age group is difficult and requires special expertise. Further, its diagnostic value often is limited. In an attempt to improve diagnostic accuracy,some modifications of the EEG technique have been developed, such as serial or prolonged studies,continuous EEG monitoring, cerebral function monitoring, and synchronized video/EEG recording. EEG rarely is helpful for identifying a specific etiology, but interictal abnormalities, especially the background electrical activity, may have significant prognostic value.The treatment of neonatal seizures should be directed toward correcting the underlying physiologic and metabolic derangements (if present) and controlling ongoing or recurrent seizures. If necessary, immediate support of ventilation and perfusion must be ensured. When the cause is not a particular correctable metabolic derangement (eg, intracranial infection, hemorrhage, inborn errors of metabolism), appropriate specific treatment should be initiated in conjunction with symptomatic treatment with anticonvulsant medications. A scheme for treatment of neonatal seizures is outlined in Table 5. Serial blood levels of anticonvulsants (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin)often must be obtained to determine maintenance dosages because of the variable pharmacokinetics in this age group. Enteric absorption of phenytoin is especially unpredictable. There are anecdotal reports of the use of other anticonvulsants,including primidone, lamotrigine,thiopentone, paraldehyde (no longer available in the United States, but available in Canada), and carbamazepine, for treatment of refractory seizures.Several major issues remain unresolved, including optimal maintenance doses of anticonvulsants, the importance of eliminating electrographic seizures, and the optimal duration of anticonvulsant therapy. The duration of therapy must be guided by the underlying etiology. Recent reports suggest that unnecessary prolongation of therapy for transient disorders should be avoided because of unresolved concerns about the possible adverse effects of anticonvulsants on the developing nervous system. There is no evidence that prolongation of anticonvulsant therapy decreases the risk for developing epilepsy in later childhood.The mortality rate for clinical seizures in term newborns has decreased considerably in recent years to approximately 15%. However, mortality rates in preterm infants who have seizures remain high and may be increased as much as fourfold compared with that of term infants. In addition, adverse neurologic sequelae are common and have been reported in approximately two thirds of survivors. Mental retardation and motor deficits(cerebral palsy) are more common sequelae following neonatal seizures than epilepsy. In many instances,these sequelae may be the result of the underlying cause of the neonatal seizures.The most important determinant of prognosis is the underlying etiology. Thus, infants who have cerebral dysgenesis have uniformly poor outcomes, and 50% to 100% of those who have moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy develop sequelae. In contrast, infants who have transient metabolic derangements and are treated promptly or who have only subarachnoid hemorrhage usually have a good outcome. Intracranial infection and inborn errors of metabolism are associated with a variable prognosis.Characteristics of the clinical seizures and the EEG often are useful predictors. Early-onset seizures and frequent or prolonged seizures that are refractory to multiple anticonvulsants generally have a poor prognosis. In the term newborn, the interictal EEG may be useful for predicting outcome. A normal interictal EEG is associated with an 85%chance of normal development compared with isoelectric, low-voltage,or paroxysmal burst-suppression background activity, which generally is associated with a poor outcome. However, caution must be exercised in predicting outcome based on EEG findings because of technical and interpretive difficulties with the procedure. This applies especially to preterm newborns and term infants who have mild or moderate abnormalities on EEG.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": ": After completing this article, readers should be able to:Neonatal seizures often are a manifestation of significant neurologic disease and a major predictor of adverse neurologic outcome in the newborn. The clinical features and electroencephalographic (EEG)characteristics of neonatal seizures differ considerably from those associated with epilepsy in older infants and children, an observation that reflects the immature stage of development of the newborn brain. Another major difference relates to the fact that neonatal seizures rarely are idiopathic. Prompt diagnosis,investigation to establish the underlying etiology, and rapid intervention are essential to minimize the possibility of associated cardiorespiratory instability and to correct treatable causes. Furthermore, experimental data suggest that ongoing or prolonged seizures may cause additional cerebral injury and have detrimental long-term effects.A seizure is defined generally as an excessive, synchronous electrical discharge (ie, depolarization of neurons in the brain). However, this definition may be too restrictive when applied to seizures in the newborn. Neonatal seizures may be defined more aptly as paroxysmal alterations in neurologic function(eg, behavioral, motor, or autonomic function). This definition encompasses both clinical phenomena that correlate temporally with epileptiform EEG abnormalities and stereotypical, paroxysmal clinical activities that are not associated clearly with EEG alterations.The reported incidence of neonatal seizures varies widely. Based on clinical observation, they are thought to occur in approximately 0.5% of term newborns and 20% of preterm newborns. However, long-term EEG recordings in pharmacologically paralyzed term newborns suggest that the incidence may be as high as 40% in some high-risk populations.A detailed discussion of the physiologic and metabolic mechanisms underlying neonatal seizures is beyond the scope of this article. However, several concepts that have important clinical implications deserve amplification. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures or an orderly progression of seizures is uncommon in the newborn because of the immature organization of the cerebral cortex and incomplete myelination of the interhemispheric connections. In contrast, oral-buccal-lingual movements, oculomotor disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction are frequent clinical manifestations and are considered to reflect the relatively more advanced development of brainstem and diencephalon in this age group. Alternatively, the observed lack of correlation of clinical events with epileptiform activity recorded by surface EEG has raised the speculation that some of these clinical events represent “brainstem release phenomena” rather than true epileptic seizures (ie, primitive brainstem and spinal motor patterns that are dissociated from normal cortical inhibition).In addition to the interest surrounding the origins of “seizure-like activity” in the newborn (which may determine whether treatment with conventional anticonvulsant medications is used), the physiologic and metabolic consequences of neonatal seizures are of major clinical significance. These include interference with respiration, alterations in blood pressure, and cerebral perfusion(even in the absence of abnormal motor activity), which in turn may exacerbate hemorrhagic or ischemic brain injury. In addition,experimental data suggest that ongoing neonatal seizures may deplete cerebral glucose levels and impair synthesis of cerebral DNA and proteins,which could contribute to the extent of cerebral injury.Neonatal seizures rarely are idiopathic, and immediate attention should be focused on identifying an underlying etiology to permit appropriate intervention and to enable accurate decisions regarding prognosis. Although there are numerous possible underlying etiologies of neonatal seizures, a relatively small number account for the majority of cases (Table 1). The time of onset and characteristics of neonatal seizures may suggest the most probable cause (Table 2). Clearly, a number of concomitant etiologic factors may be operative in the same infant. For example, hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia may occur as a result of catabolic stress in certain situations,such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or meningitis.Moderate or severe acute hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy accounts for approximately two thirds of all cases of neonatal seizures. Such seizures may be of any type, usually begin at any time during the first 24 hours of life, and frequently are difficult to control effectively with anticonvulsant medications. Often there are associated abnormalities of brainstem responses and muscle tone. Hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury sustained earlier during gestation may be asymptomatic in the newborn period. Consistently unilateral, focal seizures often are indicative of localized brain lesions,especially focal cerebral infarction. However, focal or multifocal seizures in the newborn also may occur in the context of diffuse cerebral injury.The most common metabolic disturbances associated with seizures are hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and derangements of serum sodium levels. Early hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia occur most commonly following gestational diabetes and in infants who are preterm, small for gestational age, or both. Hypo- or hypernatremia may result from dehydration, inappropriate fluid administration, or inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.

      "abstract": "THE fact that, in a large proportion of cases in which the nervous sys- tem is affected with disease arising out of syphilis, the secondary stage has been brief, or imperfectly represented, or absent, and that very rarely is the history of syphilis prominent, renders it very important make out, if this be possible, such a distinctive character in syphilitic affections of the nervous system, as will of itself serve to determine the diagnosis as confidently as in the case of a node or gummy tumour.We shall see later how far this is attainable; and an intermediate step to- wards the elucidation of the problem is the consideration of the pathology of syphilitic changes occurring in the nervous structures.The symptoms to which any disease of the nervous system gives rise will arise primarily from derangement of function of the parts affected; but the kind and degree of such disturbance will be greatly influenced by the nature of the morbid process and by its rate of progress.will make a great difference, for example, whether a tumour, at a given situation in the brain or cord, have its starting-point on the surface or the substance; whether it increase rapidly or slowly; whether grow at the expense of the nervous structure, causing no actual crease of volume, or add to the contents of the cavities and displace and compress the nervous matter.In considering, therefore, morbid conditions to which syphilis gives rise, we have to take account not only the morbid anatomy, but the general habits of disease.There are very large materials from which I might draw the account to be placed before you of the morbid changes produced by syphilis the nervous structures, but I shall avail myself almost exclusively of labours of Drs.Wilks and Moxon, whose contributions are at simple, clear, and comprehensive; indeed, I know nothing in pathology more admirable than their descriptions of syphilitic disease in the Guy's Hospital Reports.According to Dr. Wilks (Guy's Hospital Reports for 1863), in syphilis, there is a disposition to the effusion of a low form of lymph, or plastic material, in nearly every tissue of the body.When this tion comes to be examined after death, ithas generally had a existence in the organ in which it is found, and it presents under microscope fibro-plastic elements, small nuclei, fatty granules, and amorphous matter.As a rule, the deposits are hard and fibrous, not soft, as suggested by the term gummy or gummatous usually to them; but they may undergo secondary softening.There is specific in the individual elements, and, indeed, the notion of a structural element in any disease is now generally abandoned ; characteristic peculiarities exist, which have been more exactly by Dr. Moxon, who says :-\" If one looks over a series of syphilitic changes, and compares these with any other forms of change, that the syphilitic cases have characters by which they are easily distinguished.These characters I will attempt to state.\"' Generally, a small part of the organ is attacked, and the is left quite free.The disease is strictly localised in the spot affects. 2.Its outer part is composed of fibrous tissue, which can be represent the natural fibrous supporting elements of the part of augmentation, while the functioning elements of the part dwindled away.It is a local sclerosis. 3.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging was shown to identify a greater number of lesions than other techniques in one study comparing outcomes from pediatric TBI and imaging findings. Balance is frequently found to be abnormal after TBI, as it involves effective integration of the sensory, motor-programming, and musculoskeletal system. Muscle tone abnormalities, including spasticity, dystonia, and rigidity, are common after TBI.

      "abstract": "IntroductionNeurosurgery is a part of the surgical field that focused in taking care of the diseases related to human's central peripheral nervous system and also their central spinal cord [20].The term surgery refers to the operation of peripheral nervous system as well as the spinal cord, brain, blood vessel connected to it, spine, spinal cord, and also nerves that control our senses and body's movement [29].There are lots of neuro diseases, which among them were brain tumors, head trauma, stroke, thalamic astrocytomas, and spinal cord trauma.These diseases, if not thrown away, will results the patient in body disorder, health problem, and of course, death.To put an end to these disorders, appropriate treatment is mandatory.Those diseases need to be cured and removed.Surgery, or specifically neurosurgery, is one of the effective methods to treat it.Neurosurgery comes with risks.Any operation dealing with brain or the spinal cord can cause paralysis, brain damage, infection, psychosis, or even death if a mistake happens.These operations are also likely to cause mental impairment as of any surgical procedure dealing with the brain.Therefore, it is vital for neurosurgeon to make sure that this kind of surgery is performed in an almost perfect condition to minimize any risks or poor results as the consequences from it.Traditionally, starting from scalp removing, drilling and removing the skull, handling the lump, until sewing the skull and scalp back at its original location; surgeons put their efforts with their own hands and bare eyes.Tools and equipments did improved, for example with the usage of apparatus such as top-mount microscope and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine.However, they still need to manipulate the surgical tools, the closest tools to the human brain, such as the knife and biopsy needles with naked hands.As a results, it will surely introduced limits to the tools manipulation.This is where robots can do a lot better.A very precise robotic device that can perform manipulation at much smaller or micro scale, plus the capability of the surgeon himself, will produce much superior results.These robotic devices are termed surgical micromanipulator.This chapter presents readers with information regarding the design of a micro-manipulator purposely for neurosurgical application.It also shares beneficial facts and particulars regarding current progress about micro-manipulator research around the globe.This chapter is organized as the following: Section 2 provides details justification of designing a robotic hand in an operating room based on the constraints for a neurosurgical procedures.Section 3 will discuss design considerations for a micro-manipulator for neurosurgery.This www.intechopen.com",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Hay pocos casos publicados de una lesión grave del nervio cubital asociada a una fractura cerrada del antebrazo. Presentamos dos casos clínicos de lesiones del nervio cubital consecuencia de una fractura cerrada de antebrazo. Un diagnóstico precoz y la detección de los signos clínicos de gravedad son fundamentales, ya que influyen directamente en la actitud a tomar y en el resultado del tratamiento. Los casos que se presentan, se trataron de forma quirúrgica y se encontraron lesiones nerviosas severas. Es difícil estandarizar el tratamiento, ya que existen distintas causas de lesión nerviosa y un rango amplio de gravedad. Tras analizar la mayoría de los casos publicados, la recomendación inicial es esperar la mejora espontánea de cuatro a seis meses. Si después de ese período, no hay mejoría de la sintomatología neurológica, está indicado realizar una exploración microquirúrgica del nervio. Se revisan algunos signos de gravedad que pueden indicar un tratamiento quirúrgico precoz.",

      "title": "Diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of secondary brain damage in icu patients with traumatic brain injuries",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the brain injury that occurs whenever a physical force that impacts the head leads to neuropathology. The types of primary TBI are penentrating TBI or non-penetrating TBI and it can lead to intracerebral contusions, hemorrhages or extra-axial hematomas. Patients with TBI can also have skull fractures or concussions. The injury severity can be classified in many ways but the most established and common used is the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS). However, with the GCS, each of the severity criteria has limitations and might mot be an accurate predictor of TBI severity and outcome when used alone. For this reason it is often used in conjunction with other parameters (Abbreviated Injury Scale - AIS). Secondary Brain Damage is the injury that occurs to the TBI patient not at the time of the accident, but during the following minutes, hours or days. There are many mechanisms that lead to development of cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, vasospasm, increase in volume of bleeding, contusions and intracranial hypertension. These mechanisms can act either in cellular level or systemic level. The cellular mechanisms that lead to secondary brain damage include necrosis or apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicicty, formation of free radicals, changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and inflammation. The mechanisms at systemic level include hypoxia-cerebral oxygenation, hypo or hypertension, hypo or hyper-capnia, anemia, hyponatremia and hyper or hypoglycemia. The first tool to diagnose severe TBI and secondary brain injury is neurological assessment. Neuroimaging is one of the most important ways for diagnosis. Computed Tomography (CT scan), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, transcranial Doppler, CT perfusion, Xenon CT, MRI diffusion, MRI perfusion, MRI spectrometry and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are possible ways of imaging that not only help in the diagnosis but give important information that help in choosing the correct management. Moreover, neuromonitoring, helps in the correct management of the patient.",

      "title": "[The role of psychosocial stress in childhood for structural and functional brain development:neurobiological basis of developmental psychopathology].",
      "abstract": "This review summarizes some important principles of human brain development. Special emphasis is placed on the role of psychosocial stress during childhood on the developing brain. Depending on the degree of cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional maturation, previous experiences and actual context, psychosocial stressors may be perceived by children as being either controllable (challenge) or uncontrollable (disaster). Controllable stress experiences are associated with a preferential activation of the central and peripheral noradrenergic system, i.e., of a system endowed with the gating of cortical information processing and the facilitation and stabilization of neuronal pathways and synaptic connections involved in behavioral responding. Uncontrollable stress responses are elicited if all previously acquired behavioral or cognitive strategies are inadequate or fail to overcome the stressor. The resulting severe and long-lasting activation of the central stress responsive systems will finally lead to a full activation of the HPA system, accompanied by adrenocortical cortisol release. The major central effect of this response is the destabilization of previously established neuronal circuits and synaptic connections. Thus, severe uncontrollable psychosocial stress may act as an important trigger of and a prerequisite for the reorganization of neuronal connectivity. It may, above a certain threshold, threaten the mental and affective stability, integrity, and the future development of a child. The long-term consequences of psychosocial stress on the structural and functional maturation of the brain are documented by findings from animal research and by results in the field of developmental psychopathology in children. The role of risk and protective factors during different phases of child development is briefly summarized and the need for a biopsychosocial model concerning the relationship between human brain development and behavior is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Children born very preterm are at a greater risk of abnormal visual and neurological development when compared to children born at full term. Preterm birth is associated with retinopathy of prematurity (a proliferative retinal vascular disease) and can also affect the development of brain structures associated with post‐retinal processing of visual information. Visual deficits common in children born preterm, such as reduced visual acuity, strabismus, abnormal stereopsis and refractive error, are likely to be detected through childhood vision screening programs, ophthalmological follow‐up or optometric care. However, routine screening may not detect other vision problems, such as reduced visual fields, impaired contrast sensitivity and deficits in cortical visual processing, that may occur in children born preterm. For example, visual functions associated with the dorsal visual processing stream, such as global motion perception and visuomotor integration, may be impaired by preterm birth. These impairments can continue into adolescence and adulthood and may contribute to the difficulties in learning (particularly reading and mathematics), attention, behaviour and cognition that some children born preterm experience. Improvements in understanding the mechanisms by which preterm birth affects vision will inform future screening and interventions for children born preterm.",

Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Prior studies show that concussion can result in the onset of new mental health symptoms or exacerbate pre-existing mental health problems. Concussion-related mental health symptoms can be short-lived or long-lasting. Mental health problems following concussion can result from brain cell damage from the concussion, the psychological impact of the injury, or a combination of these factors. This chapter provides an overview of concussion and common mental health problems following concussion among elite sport athletes. This chapter summarises sport-related concussion among elite sport athletes, including the definition, causes, prevalence, symptoms and symptom profiles, diagnosis, and concussion management. Additionally, the authors provide an overview of common mental health symptoms following concussion, major risk factors of concussion-related mental health symptoms, and strategies to prevent and mitigate concussion-related mental health consequences in elite sport athletes. Finally, the chapter discusses implications for research and practice regarding mental health problems following concussion among elite sport athletes.",

The muscular involvement commenced cranially and descended in relation to increasing disease duration. The neuromuscular signs were PEO, dysarthria, dysphonia, limb muscle weakness with wasting, absence of Achilles tendon reflexes, and distal vibration sensory loss. The electromyogram (EMG) was myopathic in facial and proximal limb muscles. Neurogenic involvement was suspected in a few tibial anterior muscles. Neurography showed signs of axonal neuropathy correlated to clinical signs. F-responses were reduced in number or absent in peroneal nerves, and did not correlate to clinical signs or disease duration. Muscle biopsies in advanced cases had structural abnormalities of mitochondria, ragged-red fibers, and focal cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is frequent in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In particular, specific deficits in temporal lobe related functions occur, but deficits in extratemporal lobe functions and global intelligence are also found. The degree and type of the impairment are first determined by structural damage and functionally dynamic factors. Most cognitive problems in TLE are already detectable at, or even before, the onset of the epilepsy. Accumulation of damage during the course of chronic epilepsy may add to this. This additional damage may be caused directly by severe seizures, head trauma, intoxication etc., or indirectly by interference of the epilepsy with mental development. Surgical treatment of TLE may also affect the cognitive outcome of patients with chronic TLE, with a risk of additional impairments on the one hand and functional recovery due to seizure control on the other hand. With regard to patient-associated factors, better baseline performance, younger age, cerebral plasticity, and good mental reserve capacities are associated with a better outcome. With regard to treatment-associated factors, prevention of additional brain dysfunction/damage and successful seizure control are important.",

Unfortunately, the development of delirium or acute brain dysfunction is considered a non-essential component of a critical or unfavorable disease. The agitation and inactivity that is occurred in a delirium can increase the risk or danger of complications. Delirium is a major cause and the problem of hospitalization and should be considered a medical crisis. For these reasons its identification, prescription, and effective treatment are essential.

Acquired: post-traumatic, toxic, vascular (hypertensive and atherosclerotic), metabolic, postinflammatory. On the basis of analysis of clinical findings and causes the conclusion may be reached that encephalopathy is a sequela of diffuse organic brain damage, that is, it is a \"status post...\", but this excludes certain encephalopathies recognize as yet (hypertensive encephalopathy).

This chapter provides an overview on such neoplastic and non-neoplastic, often space-occupying processes that can be found in sural and other diagnostic nerve biopsies. These lesions present clinically with symptoms of focal or generalized neuropathy such as sensory deficits, dysesthesias, pain and pareses.

      "abstract": "Summary: The term encephalopathy encompasses a wide variety of complex syndromes caused by a large number of different toxic, metabolic, infectious, and degenerative derangements. Acute encephalopathy typically presents with a fluctuating course involving alteration of mental status or confusion and decreased (or rarely increased) motor activity. There usually are lethargy, cognitive impairment, altered memory and mental processing of information, and disturbed sleep–wake cycles. Encephalopathy mainly occurs in the elderly and is frequently encountered in intensive care units and postoperatively. Despite new diagnostic procedures and advances in intensive medical care, acute encephalopathy constitutes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. EEG enables rapid bedside electrophysiological monitoring providing dynamic real-time information on neocortical brain activity and dysfunction. Hence, EEG complements clinical and neuroimaging assessments of encephalopathic patients. Progressive slowing of EEG background activity with increasing cerebral compromise, the emergence of episodic electrographic transients, seizures, and decreased EEG reactivity to external stimuli provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence for the diagnostic and prognostic value of EEG in adult intensive care unit patients with acute nonhypoxic encephalopathy.",

They can be classified according to the number and distribution of nerves affected or may be categorized based on their causative mechanism. Neuropathy affecting one nerve is called mononeuropathy whereas neuropathy affecting multiple nerves is called polyneuropathy. The term mononeuritis multiplex is applied when one or more separate nerves in disparate areas are affected. In this chapter, we classify the neuropathies based on the underlying pathology. Neuropathies are subcategorized into axonal type (associated with axonal degeneration) or demyelinating type (associated with segmental demyelination).",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment after critical illness (CIACI) is a frequent consequence of serious disease or injury that has been reported in as many as 66 % of patients, 3 months after an illness requiring intensive care unit hospitalisation. The condition has been recognised only within the past 15 years and its pathological mechanisms are, as yet, incompletely understood. The neurological changes and cellular and inflammatory processes of CIACI overlap with those of stroke, traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Patients also show brain atrophy, which worsens with the duration of intensive care unit stay. Risk factors associated with CIACI include depression, biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (e.g. apolipoprotein E), delirium, exposure to some drugs (e.g. fentanyl, morphine and propofol) and intubation. Current strategies to prevent or treat CIACI include treatments to reduce agitation and delirium and physical and mental rehabilitation including cognitive therapy. Many brain diseases and injuries affect the functioning of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which constitutes the key cellular building block of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). CIACI is believed to affect the integrity of the NVU and it is among the potential targets for therapy. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known to play an important role in neurogenesis, maintenance of NVU structure and neuronal repair after disease and injury. This led to the development of strategies including the NTF-preparation (Cerebrolysin®), which is effective as a post-stroke therapy and has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and brain injury as well as CIACI. There are currently no proven treatments for CIACI; improved understanding of the condition and further evaluation of NTFs may lead to effective treatments, which are vital to tackle this increasingly serious public health problem.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating traumas for an individual because the complete traumatic spinal cord injury leads to paraplegia or tetraplegia. The mechanical injuries directly cause axonal destruction in fiber tracts, destruction of the neurons and of the glial cells, and their destruction releases substances whose presence, quantity and dynamics can be lesional biomarkers. The reactions of partially injured cells simultaneously start and the occurring substances and their quantity may be reaction biomarkers. The lesional biomarkers appear immediately postinjury and after several hours there are both lesional biomarkers and reaction biomarkers. The most important lesional biomarkers are the phosphorylated neurofilament subunits resulting from the axonal neurofilament destruction. The heavy phosphorylated neurofilament subunit (pNF-H) is a predictive lesional biomarker because its values pattern can show the reducing or stopping of the secondary lesions and the favorable outcome. The complete SCI patients with a favorable development had a specific pattern of daily values of pNF-H: a sudden increase up to a maximum value then a progressive decrease to normal. The patients with unfavorable outcome or neurological stabilisation had two patterns: an increase to a plateau of pNF-H values or a progressive increase up to a peak followed by a progressive decrease to quasi-normal values.",

A method has been devised to produce a focal neuritis in the rat sciatic nerve that involves no more than trivial structural damage to the nerve. This experimental focal neuritis produces neuropathic pain sensations (heat- and mechano-hyperalgesia, and cold- and mechano-allodynia) in the ipsilateral hind paw. The abnormal pain sensations begin in 1–2 days and last for 4–6 days, with a subsequent return to normal. These results suggest that there is a neuroimmune interaction that occurs at the outset of nerve injury (and perhaps episodically over time in slow developing conditions like diabetic neuropathy) that produces neuropathic pain. The short duration of the phenomena suggest that they may prime the system for more slowly developing mechanisms of abnormal pain (e.g., ectopic discharge in axotomized primary afferent neurons) that underlie the chronic phase of painful neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "In critically ill patients, the central nervous system remains vulnerable to multiple insults including ischemia, hemorrhagic events, and encephalopathy. The peripheral nervous system is vulnerable in the setting of neuro-muscular blockade (NMB), related drug-drug interactions, and drug-clinical state interactions. Optimal assessment of the nervous system is done by means of the clinical neurological examination. In this manner, orientation, arousal, and responsiveness to stimulation provide feedback on focal and global stability of the central nervous system. Where clinical evaluation is compromised, such as with deep sedation and NMB, risk of undetected seizure activity, and/or progression of neurological injury increases dramatically. A patient receiving NMB risks breakthrough awareness and pain. Long-term complications of NMB including prolonged weakness or paralysis as well as post-traumatic stress dramatically increase morbidity and length of stay. Technologies such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS trade mark ) monitoring are effective for assessing cerebral function as well as level of sedation or arousal, respectively, in patients with a compromised neurological assessment. Neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring by means of peripheral nerve stimulation and assessment of the evoked response may be utilized, within the context of clinical assessment, to determine level of chemical paralysis and minimize dosing of NMB agents. This article explores utilization and differentiates technologies such as EEG, BIS, and NMT monitoring. Monitoring parameters are illustrated using a case study approach.",

There appears an overestimate of the amount of aggressive behavior associated with epilepsy, yet it has clearly been demonstrated via telemetric patient monitoring. It may occur ictally, postictally and interictally with the majority of reports describing post-ictal aggression or post-ictal psychosis, especially with temporal lobe epilepsy. The relevant neurobiology suggests peri-amygdala pathology, possibly with left or bilateral EEG and MRI abnormalities. PET studies have demonstrated temporal and frontal hypometabolism while the involvement of various neurotransmitters has been implicated. Associated familial behavioral problems have been reported together with comorbidities and underlying brain disorders. Treatment may include use of antiepileptic medications, atypical antipsychotic agents, non-pharmacological psychotherapy and, possibly, deep brain stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1.

      "abstract": "Dementia is usually attributable to one or a combination of neuropathologic abnormalities, including Alzheimer amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Most demented individuals have at least two types of dementia-related abnormality. Older decedents without abnormalities may be viewed as showing resistance to the relevant pathogenic processes. Others with brain or cognitive reserves may maintain normal cognitive performance even when 1 or 2 types of histopathologic abnormality have developed. We hypothesize essential resilience as a third defense against established neuropathology. Analyses involved 572 autopsied HAAS participants (Japanese-American men) dying at age 80 or older whose baseline Cognitive Assessment and Screening Instrument (CASI) score had been normal (>=74). End-of-life severe impairment was based on a final CASI score <60. Four overlapping reserve elements were each dichotomized as 0 or 1: (i) negligible brain atrophy, (ii) higher education, (iii) higher occupational complexity, (iv) higher adult life cognitive test scores. A neuropathologic burden index (Neurology, March 2016) was the sum of four histopathologic abnormalities, each scored 0.4 (moderate) or 1.0 (severe) for Alzheimer lesions, microinfarcts, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis. Among 159 participants with a neuropathologic burden index of zero, 145 (91%) maintained normal cognition. Among 387 with burden indices 0.4 - 1.8 (most with two moderate or severe lesion types), the proportions developing severe impairment fell from 49%, to 35%, to 29%, to 25%, to 13% respectively in decedents with zero, 1, 2, 3, or all 4 reserve elements. Of 26 decedents with neuropathologic burden indices >=2, 22 (85%) developed severe cognitive impairment. We continue to search for factors determining essential resilience. In this autopsied cohort, brain and/or cognitive reserves provided a powerful attenuation of cognitive impairment attributable to a panel of neuropathological abnormalities. A hypothesized additional contribution by essential resilience remains to be demonstrated.",

Terapi farmakologi seperti pemberian Antidepresan dan Antipsikotik atau disebut juga dengan neuroleptik untuk menurunkan frekuensi dan tingkat keparahan simtom-simtom psikotik pada penderita skizofrenia. Pengobatan dengan antipsikotik sering menimbulkan efek samping seperti mulut kering (xerostomia). Xerostomia sekunder untuk hiposalivasi juga dapat mengakibatkan karies gigi rampan, infeksi jamur mulut seperti kandidiasis, perubahan rasa, mulut berbau, atau mulut terbakar. Karies gigi merupakan penyebab utama kehilangan gigi di kalangan kelompok muda. Hilangnya satu atau beberapa gigi dapat menyebabkan gangguan fungsi pengunyahan, bicara dan estetika yang dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup seseorang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui hubungan gangguan psikotik skizofrenia paranoid terhadap kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh.

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "abstract": "A paralisia cerebral congrega um grupo de afeccoes, secundarias a uma lesao, danificacao ou disfuncao permanentes do SNC, nao possui carater progressivo,  e sua  instalacao  pode acontecer no periodo pre, peri ou pos-natal podendo  causar alteracao dos movimentos controlados ou posturais. O quadro clinico da Paralisia Cerebral e baseado no disturbio motor gerado, que pode ser classificado a partir da extensao ou distribuicao do disturbio; pela intensidade; ou pela qualidade do tonus. A extensao da lesao e caracterizada como quadriplegia, hemiplegia, diplegia ou monoplegia; a  intensidade pode ser leve, moderada, ou grave; a  qualidade do tonus  pode ser definida como espasticidade, discinesia (coreo-atetosico e distonico), rigidez, ataxia, hipotonicidade, ou mista (soma de dois tipos de tonus diferentes) (1,2,3) . Esse trabalho tem o objetivo de fornecer informacoes sobre a Paralisia Cerebral do tipo Atetosica, com a proposta de demonstrar, atraves da evolucao da paciente, como se da a abordagem fisioterapeutica durante o tratamento do paciente com essa patologia. Foi realizado um relato de caso baseado no tratamento de uma paciente do Centro de Educacao e Saude Ninota Garcia, pertencente ao grupo de criancas atendidos por alunos da disciplina de Fisioterapia na Saude da Crianca. O tratamento da paciente foi direcionado pelos  resultados encontrados em sua avalicao. Para escolha das tecnicas a serem aplicadas foi realizada uma revisao da literatura a partir da busca de estudos  que  avaliassem tecnicas de tratamento de Paralisia Cerebral do tipo Atetosica,  usando como descritores os termos  ?Athetosis? e  ?Physical Therapy? , nas bases de dados  SciELO, LILACS, PubMed,  no periodo de  2005 a 2014, alem de pesquisa realizada na Biblioteca Central Jacinto Uchoa de Mendonca usando como  descritores os termos  ?Paralisia Cerebral?, ?Fisioterapia Pediatrica?. Apos 17 sessoes de fisioterapia a evolucao da paciente trouxe resultados gratificantes, pois apesar de um prognostico  complexo, as expectativas do tratamento foram alcancadas, principalmente no que diz respeito a manutencao automatica de uma posicao desejada ou movimento contra a gravidade, onde ela consegue agora passar mais tempo sustentando a cabeca quando tenta acompanhar um objeto com o olhar, e segura por mais tempo o tronco quando posta na posicao sentada. Apesar  desse aumento de tempo ser traduzido em poucos segundos ainda sim e considerado um ganho.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a brain dysfunction that occurs secondary to infection in the body, characterized by alteration of consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, seizure or focal neurological signs. SAE involves a number of mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, in which the interaction between cytokines and acetylcholine results in neuronal loss and alterations in cholinergic signaling. Moreover, the interaction also occurs in the periphery, accelerating a type of immunosuppressive state. Although its diagnosis is not specific in biochemistry and imaging tests, it could potentiate severe outcomes, including increased mortality, cognitive decline, progressive immunosuppression, cholinergic anti-inflammatory deficiency, and even metabolic and hydroelectrolyte imbalance. Therefore, the bilateral communication between SAE and the multiple peripheral organs and especially the immune system should be emphasized in sepsis management.",

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Neuropsychiatric ManifestationsThe manifestations of neuropsychiatric illness in lupus erythematosus in order of decreasing frequency are (1) alterations of mental function including organic brain syndromes, affective illnesses, and schizophrenia-like disorders;(2) transient or recurrent seizures, usually generalized, although a variety of forms has been described; (3) paresis resulting from ischemia or hemorrhage; (4) tremor, choreoathetosis, or ataxia; (5) nuclear and infranuclear cranial neuropathies; and (6) peripheral neuropathies, usually of a mixed sensory-motor variety.Feinglass et al. 1 surveyed the relationships of nervous system involvement to other manifestations of the disease.Neuropsychiatric manifestations attributed to central nervous system SLE occurred in 37% of 140 patients, and five of these presented with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.The most frequent manifestations were psychiatric dysfunction, seizures, long tract signs, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.Psychiatric abnormalities secondary to SLE were characterized by organic features and by associated neurological findings, often diffuse or multifocal.The spinal fluid was abnormal in only 32%, usually a modest elevation of protein (70 to 92 mg/dl) and/or pleocytosis.The EEG was abnormal in 71%, particularly in association with seizures or focal neurological signs.Frequently, central nervous system abnormalities were an early feature, and in 63% neuropsychiatric involvement either",

Neurological patients also experience psychological responses to their illness resulting in a heightened potential for a dual impact on behavior. The neuropsychiatric nurse provides care to patients with severe or unusually persistent behavioral manifestations of illness. Neurologic, psychiatric, cognitive and functional assessments are completed by the neuropsychiatric nurse to obtain an accurate picture of the behavioral problem. Nursing interventions are then developed to improve functional ability and promote independence. If a neuropsychiatric nurse is not available many of these assessment skills can be employed by neuroscience nurses and implemented on neurological and neurosurgical units.",

      "abstract": "Summary Background Emotion processing is essential for well-being and psychosocial adaptation. Alexithymia is widely viewed as an impairment in emotion processing that includes difficulty identifying and describing emotions. While there is a significant understanding of primary alexithymia, which is thought to be the result of developmental genetic and familial factors, secondary and organic alexithymia are beginning to be focus of research. Method and results The present review of the literature suggests the importance of differentiating between primary and secondary alexithymia, and the organic subtype of secondary alexithymia. Secondary alexithymia is thought to be a consequence of psychological stress, chronic disease, or organic processes (e.g. brain trauma or stroke) that occur after childhood (whereas primary alexithymia is a developmental phenomenon). Organic insults to the brain may bring about the organic form of alexithymia by altering cerebral structures involved in emotional processing (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, frontostriatal networks, callosum corpus, right hemisphere cortex and amygdala). The usefulness of differentiating among alexithymia categories and their relationships with brain structures known to subserve emotional processing is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Some studies have demonstrated that cognitive decline occurs in Dravet syndrome, starting shortly after the onset of seizures, rapidly progressing and then plateauing within a few years. It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

Asphyxia can cause motor or mental deficits, but only if the insult was severe and prolonged (when there will be evidence of hypoxia in systems other than the CNS). Even abnormal CNS signs do not necessarily reflect clinically important neurologic damage. Intrapartum care has much less impact on neonatal outcome than previously believed, and most bad outcomes have their origins in events occuring long before the onset of labour and outside the detection capabilities of current technology. Nevertheless, family physicians require resuscitation skills because vigorous, effective management of even very hypoxic neonates can improve and normalize outcome.",

      "abstract": "Key Points 1 Mental status changes are often the earliest indication of an untoward complication after transplantation. These may be obvious, such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions, or they may be subtle, appearing as changes in personality or motivation. 2 The three most common categories of neuropsychiatric posttransplant complications include the following: (1) concurrent pathological processes, such as mass lesion; (2) effects of vasoconstriction secondary to immunosuppressive medications; and (3) central nervous system pharmacodynamic effects of the immunosuppressive medications. 3 This differential diagnosis should guide the history as well as the mental status and neurological examinations. Suspected acute processes deserve computed tomography scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging, more sensitive to subtle structural change, should be generally reserved for cases suggesting such chronic change or those in which treatment appears ineffective. 4 Treatment follows the differential diagnosis. Concurrent diagnoses dictate specific treatment, such as in drainage of a subdural hematoma or administration of antibiotics for cerebral abscess. Symptoms referable to vasoconstriction suggest switching the primary immunosuppressive agent. Symptoms suggesting delirium indicate lowering the dosage of immunosuppressive medication, as in the case of generalized seizure, or use of very low-dose antipsychotic medication, as in cases of confusion, amotivational states, or personality changes.",
